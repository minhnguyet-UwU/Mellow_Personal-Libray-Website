0,Nilufer Ozmekik,The Alchemist,"Dec 18, 2018",5,"Whenever I felt lost, depressed, sad, numb, conflicted, frustrated, exhausted, I get this book into my hands and follow the journey of young shepherd Santiago who is looking for a worldly treasure. As like T.S. Eliot says: ‚Äú The journey not the arrival matters.‚Äù 

This journey is about self discovery, fighting with your own demons, letting your heart being your own eyes and leading you throughout the dark and threatening roads of life. It‚Äôs epic, uplifting, motivational, inspirational,heartfelt, poignant! 

Here are my favorite quotes of the book:
‚ÄúWhen we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe simple things are also the most extraordinary things, and only the wise can see them.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't give in to your fears. If you do, you won‚Äôt be able to talk to your heart.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.‚Äù"

Pre-review:

You know what? I've been wanting to reread these books for probably a decade, and I'm still (inexplicably) battling my ever present book funk, so I'm just gonna do it.

3,Barbie,Charlotte's Web,"Apr 16, 2019",5,"My thoughts in a nutshell 
Charlotte‚Äôs Web is one of my favorite childhood books. I watched it so many times and never got bored with it.

The story is about‚Ä¶
Skip over this point if you don't like the sneak peek. 
A little pig who wants to see the first show and who wants to live instead of becoming sausages.

 What impressed me the most üòä 
This little story has many important feelings and lesson. It teaches us to respect other living creatures and how to live side by side in peace. It told about humility and explained how important it is to have a great friendship. A friend who does anything to saved her little buddy‚Äôs life. A friend who once made a promise and now she will go through fire and water to keep her word.

I‚Äôve become such a sensitive little girl if the story is about an animal‚Äôs death. I‚Äôm feeling sorry about all of them. In my world, I think they have soul and they are sentinent beings. 
This book is an amazing classic, and it made me emotional. Haha.

 Make a conclusion 
I gave it 5 stars because it is perfect for me. It has a much valuable lesson and I really appreciate it. 
I recommend it to everyone who hasn‚Äôt read it. Wait a second! Why don‚Äôt you read it yet? Go to the library, NOW! Or watch the movie I recommend it too.

 Atmosphere collage  aka.  how did I imagine the book vibes?"
4,Lucy,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Dec 04, 2007",4,"** spoiler alert **
           For the last two months I have been putting off reading this book. For starters, I bought the book at an airport in Taiwan, which meant it didn't have a due date which meant it took a backseat to many books that I didn't have the luxury of reading whenever.

Additionally, because I've heard so much about this book already, I almost didn't want to read it at all. I've heard that it's depressing, that it's not as good as The Kite Runner, and that it's basically a novel about the brutal treatment of women in Afghanistan.

You know when you read a book or see a film that has had great reviews and you finish feeling disappointed because it didn't live up to the hype? My experience reading this book was the complete opposite. I loved it. I didn't feel the message of the book was one of brutality or depression, but of hope and the toughness of the human spirit.

There are plenty of awful scenes to lend credence to its reputation. While the story's time frame spans thirty years, the main focus of the novel are two woman, a generation apart, whose lives cross as they become the wives of the same man, Rasheed. The elder, Mariam, was born to a servant woman out of wedlock and is raised in banishment, ignorance and eventual rejection during the years the Afghani government was controlled by the communists. She finds herself forced to marry a much older man after her mother commits suicide. Laila, fifteen years younger and raised by intellectual parents, enters the marriage under much different circumstances. Alone after a bomb destroys her home and kills her parents, and pregnant by her childhood love who has fled the country, she marries Rasheed in a desperate attempt to save her unborn child.

The writing engrossed me. Much like the Kite Runner, Hosseini magically puts the reader in the city, neighborhood and house of his characters. Much to his credit, I found myself torn between wanting to yell at Laila to hush up, so that she'd avoid another beating, and kicking Rasheed myself, because he is a despicable brute.

Mariam, one of the most tragic characters in literature, makes this book what it is; a story of love and strenghth. She, who didn't have an easy day in her life, allows herself to be touched by the love of Laila and her children. In return, she performs the ultimate act of love and saves a family.

I appreciate Hosseini's portrayal of a part of the world that is under so much scrutiny lately. Afghanistan, and the city of Kabul where the story takes place, have a long history of wars and occupations which result in a great chasm between different ethnic tribes, Islam, economic classes and gender. Hosseini uses this novel to tell the story of Afghani women and the hardships that face them with each regime change.

As a woman, I feel blessed to have been given confidence and opportunities. I truly cannot imagine what it would be like to live under the conditions the women in this book live under. I am grateful to be born to the family I was born to and in a country which allows me to live the kind of life I choose.

Miram and Laila didn't have the opportunities or support that I have. And yet they survived. They endured and they reached out to others, despite their circumstances. In this, Hosseini redeems all of Afghanistan by showing these two women's humanity. He shows that in a place whose beauty was written about in a 17th century poem, where ""One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs and the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls"" is a city that can become illuminated once again."
5,Jason Koivu,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Nov 29, 2008",5,"A Cinderella romance that unexpectedly swept me away! Memoirs of a Geisha is a very picturesque and dramatic tale of a young village girl taken from her family and raised in Kyoto as a geisha. 

Usually I don't go in for romance. Don't get me wrong, I love love. But I prefer my love stories to be true. There is something immensely powerful about real love. As far as I've been able to discover, much of this story is based on the actual events of the life of former geisha Mineko Iwasaki. Why do I think so? She sued Golden for defamation of character. Apparently he included details she'd told him during their interviews that were not meant for print. Well, that's good enough for me!

I was dazzled by the details and enchanted by the well-paced plot. It's not for everyone, but if you liked the movie version you shouldn't be disappointed by the book, being that the two are identical in most ways. 

Around the time I read Memoirs... I got the chance to visit Kyoto and made a point, as many tourists do, of seeking out the Gion District. The preservation of the area makes it worth the effort and cost of traveling in Japan. Almost medieval in its narrowness, the main historical road is a delight to behold, with its architecture and decor stuck in time as it is and the occasional geisha shuffling to and from buildings. I highly encourage a visit. Go when the cherry blossoms are in bloom. Go see a tea ceremony. Just go. You'll be glad you did."
6,Ruby Granger,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Oct 24, 2017",5,"2021 - I re-read this for university and loved it even more the second time round... Lord Henry is a paradigmatic sophist and his epigrams are delightful (partly because it's easy to forget that he is more rhetoric than truth). The connection between youthful appearance and character is also so fascinating, especially since Wilde is writing at the end of the century where physiognomy is an outdated science. What does it mean to be young? And can innocence ever be restored?

2017 - If you haven't already, you HAVE TO read this! Wilde delves into the cartesian dualist debate, asking us to question where the self truly does reside (and contradicting the popular Victorian idea of physiognomy). In his personal Fall and descent into sinfulness I saw similarities with H.G. Wells's 'The Invisible Man' where sin thrives simply because the individual cannot be held accountable. Similarly, the debate about the value of art is intriguing and, after reading this, I recommend reading Poe's 'The Oval Mirror' because, again, there are definite similarities."
7,Baba,Little Women,"Mar 23, 2022",3,"This is a classic that has never appealed from the title, cover and few reviews I have read of it over the years. A story a year in the lives of the four March sisters, the oldest being 16 and the youngest being 12 told in a style. A bildungsroman loosely based on the lives of the writer and her three sisters with numerous nods to and references to John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. The work is seen as more or less the seminal Young Adult book as being pretty much the first to merge sentimental and romantic themes into a work for children. It was a roaring commercial and critical success from the off!

On completing this book I read a number of online reviews and was not surprised to find out that it is generally accepted that this depicts an idealised version of Alcott's youth and is actually seen as one of the core roots of the idea of an 'all-American girl'. The book does have an almost fairy tale like feel, but the writer still manages to build some impressive characterisations as well as lots of pulling of heartstrings. In the context of when it was written, it's overall pleasing message which although likening domesticity and the search for true love as core goals for young women , also has surprisingly strong pro-woman themes set around the strength of the mother and sense of the power and importance of female/sister kinship it's well worth the 7 out of 12, Three Stars I give it :)

2022 read"
8,Lisa of Troy,The Outsiders,"Dec 09, 2022",1,"What book did you just not ‚Äúget‚Äù?

When I was in tenth grade, I read The Outsiders for the first time. The story was boring, and I didn‚Äôt connect with the characters. 

Then, we had the class discussion. Apparently, there was some ‚Äúobvious‚Äù symbolism that I had missed. At the time, I thought that this book was like The Da Vinci Code, a mystery where I had missed a key clue. How brilliant this author must be! My regard for this book became almost reverential. 

Fast forward some years until Lisa becomes ‚ÄúLisa of Troy.‚Äù The Outsiders appears on the  list of GoodReads books with 1 million or more ratings. Of course, I am going to read it again!

What did I think of it this time? It is still boring, and I didn‚Äôt connect with any of the characters. 
The Outsiders has a few key events, and the book should have been shorter. The repetition was ad nauseam. There were many versions of, ‚ÄúGolly‚Ä¶gee! I act like a thug but I‚Äôm just a cuddly teddy bear inside. I wouldn‚Äôt hurt nobody!‚Äù 

‚ÄúGolly‚Äù is mentioned eight times in The Outsiders, and it isn‚Äôt even that long of a book. 

There are also too many different characters. Why would the author name two characters Dally and Darry? For the longest time, I thought that they were the same character.

There is no way to know if I would now pick up on the ‚Äúobvious‚Äù symbolism, but if I was a betting person, I would assume not. If you want to know what I missed, you can scroll to the bottom of this. It might be a spoiler. Even knowing the symbolism this time around, it wasn‚Äôt even to redeem this book.

12,Claudia Lomel√≠,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Dec 25, 2014",4,"So... I don't really know what to say.

I think I loved this book, but for a reason beyond my understanding, it never hooked me, and it took me AGES to finish it! Some chapters (especially at the beginning) were tedious and hard for me to get through them... but then there were some chapters that I devoured (the whole Tom Robinson trial and the last ones).

I definitely learned a lesson or two from this book. Atticus is my new role model, he is really incredible. I also love Scout and Jem, those kids will be in my heart forever. Oh! And I loved the Boo Radley storyline, it left me in awe.

This book surely deserves 5 solid stars, and I kinda feel bad for giving it 4 stars, but the thing is... I was struggling to finish it, I swear I let out a relieved sigh when I read the last sentence.

But all in all, it was a great read <3. And can't tell you how much I loved the last chapters, (view spoiler)[the part were Scout stands in Boo Radley's house and realizes the way he sees everything almost made me cry (hide spoiler)]."

So the International Fleet recruits children for harsh training on the immense orbiting space station but since some are as young as six this seems sick and it is. Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin 6, from a trio of brilliant siblings, gentle sister Valentine 8, and vicious Peter 10, the surprise, the parents John and Theresa are a nondescript American couple, maybe, and again rather ordinary in appearance. This in the age of Starships, faster-than-light travel, requiring captains and admirals, however the older ones though unusually intelligent kids have already been washed out for obvious reasons. Treated like Spartans boys ( a few girls) from ancient Greece but much worse, Ender feels the pain of a lonely existence above the world even hated by the other jealous children because his higher abilities can't be hidden from them. Weightless in parts of the structure for training purposes in the Battle School, still different rooms have gravity because of the spinning wheel. At first fun games but quickly becomes drudgery, the tedious exercises. Colonel Graff in charge here apparently likes to inflict pain, is merciless to everyone and Ender in particular. Major Anderson second-in-command wants to moderate his superior officer but is sadly unsuccessful .The boy misses his sister the only person he really loves , his older scary brother hates him and the feeling is mutual. Year after year with no end in sight the child grows older but happiness will never arrive just suffering and his few friends adroit Alai, little Bean, Petras, very able and only girl in his army, seems an illusion... Day by day he becomes weaker in spirit... hope , a word for others to believe but Ender must believe otherwise ... The struggles will be great the rewards might be too. The novel is quite original in its plot and the main character gives a unique insight into the adolescent mind, though young he is quite perceptive. A sci-fi novel for adults."
14,Kelly,Romeo and Juliet,"Jun 01, 2007",2,"""Hey! I'm eatin' here!""

So you're at a nice outdoor cafe one day, eating your lunch, and all of a sudden some fool kids come running through the square with their swords out (apparently they've got some strong Second Amendment advocates in Verona) and insist on skewering each other right there in front of you in the square! And seriously all you want to do is just eat your (damn fine, not that anyone asked you) pasta and get back to work before your lord finds some excuse to fire you. But nooooo, instead you've gotta deal with a whole lot of screaming, panicky, dangerous crowds rubbernecking around (and betting on) these rich kids fighting over who knows (or cares) what and there's no way you're gonna get back in time.

Yeah.. that's about the read I got from Shakespeare on this play. This is an excellent deconstruction of the elements that make up major Greek tragedies, breaking it down into parts and fitting them into modern day (or it was then) society. Shakespeare was a great adapter of older tales retold to suit his own purposes, and here, it shows.

So there's this Greek story, right? It's set up on this grand scale, with major, crashing chords that are played over and over throughout the tale. There's the Greek chorus, of course, at the beginning and then somewhere in the middle to remind us what it is we're watching. There's a good deal of sky imagery to go along with this invoking of the old gods- moons, suns, clouds, night, stars, dreams, even the otherworldly fae(""Juliet is the sun,"" ""the lark the herald of the dawn"" ""take him and cut him into little stars"", the Queen Mab speech, tons of other examples). By the same token, the gods of the Underworld are equally called to witness- lots of death, grave, earth imagery as well (examples: too many to count). These extreme terms are then often juxtaposed next to each other (""wedding bed/grave"" is probably the most frequently used, for obvious reasons) throughout the course of the tale. 

Through this, Shakespeare shows you just how seriously his main characters take everything that's going on. Especially Romeo and Juliet, of course, but also all the other family members of the Capulets and Montagues (with the exception of Mercutio). Everything is on a Grand Scale. Everything is the Most Important Thing Ever! Nothing could be more Lofty!....

Until Shakespeare quite strongly states his opposition to that idea.

He thrusts this Grand Tragedy into the midst of a bustling, thriving city, where the participants must brush elbows with and be interrupted by the every day facts of life. He uses each stupid mistake to show us all the ways the end we know is coming could have been and should have been averted, were it not for the stupidest thing that could possibly happen happening in every single scenario. I ended up thinking this after seeing all those scenes of servants at the Capulet house preparing for parties, servants running about the city with messages, escorting Nurse on her errands, inserting a plague that prevented the letter from getting to Romeo. While the two teenage idiots are upstairs enacting this farce, life is happening all around them, and they are just way way too self-centered to see it. Juliet is a bit more aware than Romeo, though. She understands the conflict between the two families, what it will likely mean for them, what she needs to do to get what she wants, and how to accomplish it. And yet... even she is so centered on the fulfillment of what she wants she can barely pause to think of others. There's a great little moment when Nurse comes back from seeing Romeo in the square and Juliet is really impatient to hear what he had to say. Nurse is all 'I'm old! I'm out of breath, give me a second!' Juliet doesn't seem to really care if she dies on the spot, so long as she gets the information she wants, and then Nurse says, accidentally, the words that I think explain this whole play:

Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

EXACTLY. She's THIRTEEN, you guys. That's exactly what he SHOULD have said when he met her, and didn't. You know why? 'Cause Romeo's a virgin who really really would prefer not to be. He tells the Friar that he likes Juliet instead of Rosalind now because she loves him back and will presumably have sex with him whereas Rosalind would not. Friar's great response: ""O, she (Rosalind) knew well/Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.""

Just another case of why True Love Waits is a poor plan! If only Romeo had himself a girlfriend, this whole thing could have been avoided.

This play displays the soul of adolescence. Both positive and negative. Negative seems to be more promiently on display at first. The characters are self-centered, impatient, convinced that if what they want doesn't come true the way they want it to, the whole world will end. There's also another big adolescent theme: masks. Teenagers spend a lot of time trying to figure out what face they want to wear to the world, what they want to present themselves as, so it makes sense that there's tons of masks, hiding (lots of hiding) and subterfuge going on here.

What's interesting to me though is that it also shows the other side of adolescence, the part that's thinking about growing up, but can't quite leave behind his childish things. One major example of this to me the influence of several characters on Romeo- Mercutio and the Friar, even Benvolio. It seems to me that they're starting to get through to the guy in the short time he's there. Especially Mercutio. He gets him to go to the party, gets him to laugh and joke again, and manages to give him some fine counsel into the bargain. I witnessed a lot of echoes of Mercutio coming out in Romeo... they just don't seem to quite take hold. For instance there's Mercutio's magnificent Queen Mab speech, which he follows up with: ""True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind""

Ie, don't take all these heart burnings so seriously, kid! Romeo does appear to consider this later, though he does dismiss it. Similarly, the Friar's long speech about manhood (ie, his great smackdown of how why Romeo is terrible) seems to get to him, even Benvolio's urgings that he'll find someone else to love at the banquet seem to have worked (if not quite in the way he intended). He just couldn't quite get there. Juliet herself... well, I think we see a lot of the mature woman that she could have become- but she doesn't have a woman's experience or resources yet and she ends up giving up rather than having the opportunity to grow. Which, funnily enough, her father predicts in the first act when Paris asks for her hand in marriage with: ""Younger than she are happy mothers made,"" and the dad answers with, ""And too soon marr'd are those so early made."" Of course, he then proceeds to do the opposite of his own advice, but I don't think that undermines the message.

Elizabeth mentioned in her review that she thought there were a lot of comedic elements in this play. I agree- what with the servant characters, the stupid mixups, and that raillery that takes place between the minor members of the family, and that one Romeo/Mercutio scene before the Nurse interrupts them. My closest guess is that was Shakespeare saying, ""Look! I could be writing this! But instead, you people want to see this stupid stupid tale enacted stupidly, so I can't! I can write this soapy crap if you want me to, but this isn't who I am."" 

Or, as Mercutio says: 
""Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
for this driveling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.""

And yet... for all of that annoyance, that satire, that social criticism, that biting realism... for all of that, Shakespeare still gives this tale a beautiful sympathy, putting gorgeous words into the mouths of his leads. He makes Romeo and Juliet people, people you can envision and who you know, people you don't want to see die, in spite of all their errors right there in front of you. He respects the beauty in the craziness, explores it in wonder. He was, after all, a storyteller, and if this was a story to affect people, it deserved to be told and told as well as he knew it to be in him to do, with a understanding that extends from his characters to the audience that wanted to see it.

It is worth reading. Even if you think you've heard it all before. After all, even if you don't like it it is ""not so long as (it) is a tedious tale."""
15,‚úò‚úò Sarah ‚úò‚úò (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans),The Princess Bride,"Jun 02, 2014",2,"DNF at 60%.

How do you even begin to review a much-loved classic when you didn‚Äôt even manage to finish it? I tried. I really tried to like this book. But no, it just wouldn‚Äôt happen. To think this is Kate Daniels‚Äô favourite book! To think the Beast Lord himself tells her ‚Äúas you wish‚Äù at the end of Magic Burns! Why oh why couldn‚Äôt I like this book?! Oh well, I guess it can‚Äôt be helped.

So, let‚Äôs start from the beginning. I had a problem with this particular edition from the very first pages. First we have the introduction to the 30th edition: I read it and thought ‚Äúwow that was tedious, this Goldman is pretty full of himself isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù Okay, so here I am ready to enjoy the story. But no, not happening. First you have to read the introduction to the 25th edition. Seriously? The first introduction wasn‚Äôt annoying enough so the publishers decided to add a second one? Oookay‚Ä¶ I know I should have skipped it but I didn‚Äôt: more presumptuous blabbering courtesy of Goldman. Who does this guy think he is anyway?! I must admit, I wasn‚Äôt in the best disposition when I started reading the actual story, which probably didn‚Äôt help. Soooo, I finally get to the story, yay! Except not. Before you read the story you have to suffer through Goldman‚Äôs explanation as to why he supposedly decided to retell Morgenstern's tale. I understand this is part of the story too and it‚Äôs not completely uninteresting but at this point I just wanted to read to the freaking Princess Bride! No more Goldman talking about Goldman! 

And so the story begins! Surprising as it may sound, I loved it at first. Well, I loved the first chapter. Then it all went downhill pretty fast, or, as we French put it, it collapsed like a souffl√©. To put it plainly: I was bored to death (I said that already didn‚Äôt I?) and I didn‚Äôt like the characters at all. Buttercup: beautiful (yes I got that the first time you wrote it, no need to re-hash every two seconds) and utterly useless. I like my heroines badass and butt-kicking (too much UF I‚Äôm afraid) so Buttercup and I were on a collision course from the start. Westley: is this guy for real? Doesn‚Äôt he have a single flaw? I mean, how perfect can you get? Boring, boring, boring. Come to think of it, what bothered me most here is that the whole thing was so completely, absolutely clich√© from beginning to end (which is quite ironic when you think of it, since the story is supposed to be a parody of the genre). I guess I should have thought twice about reading the book because it is, after all, a fairytale. Strangely enough, I was expecting a fairytale with a twist, something that would make it less‚Ä¶ fairytale-y I guess. Don‚Äôt know why. I did see the movie when it first came out and enjoyed it (as far as I can remember). Then again, I was only a teenager at the time and the whole damsel in distress thing might have appealed to me then. 

So there you have it. I didn‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm giving it two stars since I didn‚Äôt even finish it. Oh well, I might not be a fairytale kind of girl but I too have a heart. Make of it what you will."
16,Lisa,Brave New World,"Jun 25, 2014",5,"""You all remember,"" said the Controller, in his strong deep voice, ""you all remember, I suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of Our Ford's: History is bunk. History, "" he repeated slowly, ""is bunk."" 
 
The rhetorical skills of the Controller remind me of the Epsilon Semi-Moron who runs one of the bravest new worlds in our current era in bunk. 
 
As I had forgotten the major plot of this dystopian novel written just when fascism emerged in the 1930s, some fifteen years before the nuclear age, I spent a day rereading it with mixed emotions. Some things are almost prophetic in all their scary details, for example the efficiency of the childlike custom-made contributor to consumerist society:

""Adults intellectually and during working hours"", he went on. ""Infants where feeling and desire are concerned.""

The reliable drug - soma - which makes sure that society's stability is not threatened, the focus on entertainment which requires people to spend money on gadgets that keep the economy working, the sexual control mechanisms (for promiscuity is just as limiting as marriage or chastity if you are not given any choice), the early childhood social conditioning in addition to biological selection processes - it all leaves a bitter taste as it rings too many bells.

The part of the plot I found difficult to swallow was the juxtaposition of the scientifically perfected ""utopia"" of drug-induced happiness with the dirty ""natural"" world of the savages, who follow absurdly ancient rituals. Their world, where ""god"" is still needed to balance their suffering and to help them accept ageing, hunger and pain, is like a black-and-white contrast foil. Their need for self-denial in God-fearing doesn't generally differ much from the self-indulgence of the consumption society where soma takes care of controlling emotions and actions. In either case, human beings are controlled, or conditioned, by a greater power, and they can fall back into a state of irresponsible acceptance of pleasure or pain, according to their choice (- which of course is pre-destined by early childhood drilling).

Call me a hopeless idealist, but there is a third alternative! 

Human beings can be offered the freedom of choice if they learn to embrace diversity, knowledge and differences of individuals rather than the ""utopian"" goal of ""sameness"" of one kind or the other. If sameness is the ultimate goal, any paradise will turn into hell, an automatic regression into robotic behaviour will follow, regardless of the oppressive dictatorship that imposes it (consumerism and religious doctrine are quite the same in Brave New World).

Interestingly, Huxley himself commented on the problematic binary world he had created when he reflected on his novel in 1946. His third option, to decentralise power and encourage individual freedom, is still a work in progress in our historical (bunk) era, and his two dystopian visions have merged into one. The worship of His Fordship, the consumerist god of the capitalist world, has been combined with ancient religious rites serving as soma for some people, while others take the more direct approach of over-consumption of food and fun and drug intake against meaninglessness. It made me think of another novel showing two juxtaposed oppressive systems, Things Fall Apart. British colonial rule, with all its religious and social implications, stands against the ancient rites of the Nigerian past, which to me would constitute just as much of a dictatorship against my personal wishes. Two opposing, rigid systems leaving no individual freedom, two doctrines that condemn whatever is different from their own specific tradition. Zero tolerance for individual differences. No compromise or combination possible. It is either or. No third or fourth option.

""Oh Ford"" can be used as casually as ""Oh Lord"" (of whichever confession), and has about as much impact. Margaret Atwood in her MaddAddam at least insisted that her new deity ""Oh Fuck"" should only be called upon in emergencies.

I finish reading Brave New World with the feeling that it is time to call on Atwood's god, for the bravest and newest of worlds is in danger. The devil is in the sameness, as is god. For they are the same thing, utopia and dystopia being completely identical, turning humans into Epsilon Semi-Morons, children or robots. Even Shakespeare can be destroyed by application in banal situations. If history is bunk, everything is always new and brave. But also meaningless.

Oh Fuck!"
17,Lisa of Troy,Lord of the Flies,"Feb 27, 2022",3,"A group of boys are stranded on a remote and deserted island. How will these boys fare away from grownups, away from society, away from rules? 

Written in 1954, The Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding is considered a classic. The symbolism in this book is unreal especially if you consider the colors mentioned in the book (pink was mentioned 40 times). Like most people, I read this in high school, and I got a lot more out of it as an adult. At the very end, I now ponder if that actually happened or if Ralph was just imagining it (trying to avoid any spoilers here). The author who is deceased now has stated that the book can mean whatever you want it to mean so clearly everything in this review is absolutely true. If you want to check out more of my thoughts and questions raised for this book, please check out the Readalong. Thank you to everyone who participated and made this reading so much better than my first!

Although this book goes down as a classic, it is rather bleak‚Äîthere is very little hope or anything that can be considered uplifting. There were too many boring descriptions of the scar (more than 20+ times) and sand (more than 70+ times). As for the audiobook through Audible, William Golding, the author, is reading the book. He sounds extremely bored. I do not recommend the Audible version. 

Overall, I wish that I hadn‚Äôt read this as a child. It traumatized me, and I wasn‚Äôt ready for it. There is too much violence and ill will in this. Every time I would pick up a book, I would think about Piggy and feel darkness. However, as an adult, perhaps I was more prepared knowing the ending, but I also developed the sophistication to appreciation the subtleties of this book. 

This book is listed as one of the 100 Books to Read According to the BBC:

18,Susan's Reviews,The Outsiders,"Jan 31, 2019",5,"S.E. Hinton started writing this book when she was 15. It started out as an essay/short story after she witnessed a friend getting jumped. In the end, she decided to write the kind of young adult novel she wanted to read: about real issues, written truthfully and with painful realism. 



This was a very controversial book in its day: I know my high school did not have it on the curriculum. What an excellent, inspiring novel. I remember how moved I had been when I read Catcher in the Rye (which, oddly enough, despite all the curse words and ""sexy"" situations, was permitted reading in my high school). The characters in The Outsiders seemed like real boys to me. 



My heart broke for the Curtis brothers, and especially for Darrie, who had to give up his college scholarship so he could keep his brothers together. What a tragic but equally uplifting story. 



 And, by the way, here are the full names of the Curtis brothers: I found this on page 172 of the Penguin Platinum Edition:
Darrel Shaynne Curtis, Jr.; Soda Patrick Curtis; Ponyboy Michael Curtis

I highly, highly recommend this excellent book: it has everything you could want in a story: likeable characters, great action and rumble sequences, personal growth and realization and a decent realistic ending. It has also stood the test of time. Good job, S.E. Hinton!"
19,Margaret M - (Working Away - limited time with lots to catch up already,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Feb 16, 2023",5,"‚ÄúYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúSir?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äîuntil you climb into his skin and walk around in it.‚Äù

With ‚ÄòTo Kill a Mockingbird‚Äô comes a story of racial injustice. One man‚Äôs struggle to defend a black man accused of raping a white girl, while teaching his children the values and morals that are important in life. A coming-of-age story where the children are forced to witness the worst and ugly side of human nature as they try to make sense of the world amidst such racism, aggression, intolerance, and hatred. 

An epic story of good versus evil. A story of suppression but also hope. A book that educates, ridicule‚Äôs and even inspires. A book everyone should read in their lifetime. 

The Plot 

To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel told from the perspective of Jean Louise Finch (Scout), who lives with her father Atticus and brother, Jem, in the fictional sleepy town of Maycomb, Alabama. Combine this with the era of the Great Depression of the 1930s, then you really have the perfect setting for such an epic story. 

For all its simplicity and modest ways of living, the town folk harbour the worst of human traits that are exposed when Tom Robinson, a black man, is charged with raping a young white girl. Although innocent, Tom was guilty in the court of public opinion, even before the trial started, because when it came to colour ‚ÄúPeople generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for‚Äù.

In the book, single father of two, Atticus Finch takes on the case and with it stirs up the anger and resentment from the ‚Äòmob‚Äô, who at one point are prepared to lynch him for defending a black man. When questioned by his daughter why he is representing Tom, Atticus‚Äô response is so poignant and commendable. 

‚Äúthey‚Äôre entitled to full respect for their opinions,‚Äù said Atticus, ‚Äúbut before I can live with other folks I‚Äôve got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn‚Äôt abide by majority rule is a person‚Äôs conscience.‚Äù‚Ä¶. if I didn‚Äôt represent Tom. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt hold up my head in town, I couldn‚Äôt represent this county in the legislature, I couldn‚Äôt even tell you or Jem not to do something again.‚Äù

How true is that‚Ä¶ However, there is an inevitability about this story from the start because although Atticus had used every argument and tool available to save Tom Robinson in the courts, in the ‚Äúsecret courts of men‚Äôs hearts Atticus had no case‚Äù. Tom was a dead man the minute Mayella Ewell opened her mouth and screamed, and an innocent life was lost.

Yet there is an innocence, coming of age and sense of decency and hope in this story that I confess to not fully grasping in my teens. I was so overwhelmed by the racism, injustice, and corruption that I failed to embrace the true beauty of this masterpiece and all its messaging.

Review and Comments

Apart from some distressing and painful themes, of racial inequality and injustice, what makes this book so affecting and poignant is the story being told through the eyes of a young girl who is trying to make sense of the world she is living in. One of the innocent ones!!!. Which brings me to the book title that makes more sense to me now as the Mockingbird had come to signify ‚Äòinnocence‚Äô of the young Scout, Jem, and the innocent man accused of a crime he did not commit. However, in a story of so much evil and injustice there is also hope, bravery, and kindness.

Atticus represents morality, courage, and reason, and through his character and others like Calpurnia, Miss Maudie, and Boo Radley, we know all is not lost. The three children in the story learn the most humane and moral lessons from these righteous characters, who also happen to deliver the best lines and most affecting quotes for the reader.

The mob, and the characters of Mayella Ewell, the girl who accused Tom of rape and her father represent evil, racism, ignorance, prejudice, and cruelty. Even the hypocrisy of the church going community is not lost to the reader. Yet for all their bigotry they do not allow Bob Ewell to become the hero in the story. He is cast aside as ‚Äòwhite trash‚Äô because there was just one thing worse in their eyes and that was a black man who had ‚Äòsome‚Äô contact with a white girl. The fact that this was instigated by her didn‚Äôt matter. Knowing he did not rape her mattered not at all. The black man was guilty. 

A book that is so heart-breaking because events like this are / were real. Injustices like this happen in certain countries and in different sections of too many communities, and like the story the law although improving does not always deliver justice. 

Poignant, heart-breaking, and deeply moving but also a beautifully written story where intolerance, and prejudice is often overshadowed with kindness, hope and courage. Stunning.

A highly recommended book."
20,Paul Bryant,The Great Gatsby,"Sep 27, 2007",3,"This is an all right-ish kind of novel, I suppose, but I always preferred Fitzgerald‚Äôs little-known prequel The Average Gatsby, although some people found the vision of Mervyn Gatsby, Jay‚Äôs obscure brother, living a reasonably okayish life as the manager of a carpet and upholstery warehouse in Des Moines a trifle dispiriting. I quite agree that The Bad Gatsby was a shameless self-ripoff which did Fitzgerald no favours. (The threesome scene between Warren Harding, John Dillinger and Gatsby was in poor taste and I do not see how it got past the censor. I have never been able to look at a set of deer antlers without blushing ever again.) And I must say that these new franchised-out novels like The Late Gatsby (Jay as vampire, inevitable I suppose),  The Grape Gatsby (must be aimed at the vegan crowd) and The Lesbian Gatsby (in which ‚Äì surprise ‚Äì he never was a man), followed up by The Straight Gatsby - and The Groped Gatsby in which he was recovering from sexual abuse at the hands of Warren Harding - what can one say - The Ingrate Gatsby (in which he doesn't get rich and is really bitter) - must have literature fans gnawing each other‚Äôs kindles in sheer angst. They‚Äôre a disgrace. I have even seen a superhero graphic novel called Batgatsby. Or did I dream that. Hmm. Maybe there isn‚Äôt a Batgatsby. I wonder if it would sell‚Ä¶ I bet it would. Batgatsby."
21,Big Red,The Catcher in the Rye,"May 08, 2008",5,"J.D. Salinger‚Äôs ‚ÄòCatcher in the Rye‚Äô was published on July 16, 1951. It was his first novel. It became very popular among young adolescents yet not so popular with older generations. I personally thoroughly enjoyed every part of this book. I felt very close to Holden Caulfield, the main character in the story, as I read it. 
Holden Caulfield, a sixteen year old boy from New York, was quite unlike kids his age. He had no interest in being popular or social. From the very beginning he lets us into part of his personal life. His parents are very touchy and his mother is especially protective. It becomes clear very quickly where Holden‚Äôs interests lie and where they start to veer off. He tends to lean away from the fake in the world and is a teller of what is real. 
Holden is not a fan of the movies at all. He saw his brother, D.B., throw away his natural writing talent all for a large Hollywood check. Any other boy Holden‚Äôs age would have been absolutely ecstatic to have a sibling working amongst the stats in Hollywood, but not Holden. It was all far too ‚Äúphony‚Äù for him; and phony is his worst enemy. 
Salinger‚Äôs use of sarcasm and irony is beautiful and hilarious. As I read through each chapter I found myself highlighting funny, sarcastic things Holden would say or think (and trust me, there are DOZENS of time where this occurs.) One specific time in Chapter 8 he is talking to a cab driver who is acting like a real fool. Holden says to the readers, ‚ÄúHe certainly was good company. Terrific personality.‚Äù 
Salinger‚Äôs character Holden is actually a lot like Salinger in his real life. Like Holden, Salinger was known for his reclusive nature. Uninterested with the fakeness of the world, Holden keeps his distance from phony people. After Salinger‚Äôs success of ‚ÄòThe Catcher in the Rye‚Äô, he slowed down his publishing and slowly but surely drifted out of the public eye. To this day Salinger refuses any offers to have ‚ÄòThe Catcher‚Äô put on the big Hollywood screen. Salinger‚Äôs ex lover, Joyce Maynard, even once said that, ‚ÄúThe only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J.D. Salinger.‚Äù It seems to me that it is no coincidence that Holden is no fan of Hollywood and that Salinger in real life and doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with turning his popular novel into a movie. Holden says, ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one thing I hate, it‚Äôs the movies, Don‚Äôt even mention them to me.‚Äù
Since I have learned more about Salinger‚Äôs personal life, I recognize a lot of Salinger‚Äôs personality in Holden. In the story, Holden has overbearing parents much like Salinger‚Äôs parents. Salinger said his mother was over protective. Salinger has one sibling, a sister, which is ironic because it is Holden‚Äôs sister Phoebe who has a profound influence on Holden. He often talks about her with very high regards.
Holden is not a character who tried to sugarcoat the way he sees the fakeness around him. Holden, making fun of the people around him, often says things like ‚Äúyou would‚Äôve puked‚Äù and ‚Äúit was very phony‚Äù. I think that is another one of the reasons I like his character so much. For example, he is quite upset with the fact that his brother D.B. is selling his work to Hollywood instead of using his talents for his own pleasure. Holden even says that his brother is his favorite author. Salinger himself is a man who wrote for his own pleasure and likeness. 
I made a similar connection to a girl named Sally that Holden likes in the book, to a real life lover of Salinger‚Äôs named Oona. Oona O‚ÄôNeil was self-absorbed and stuck up, according to Salinger, yet he still phoned and wrote her letters quite often. Holden‚Äôs ‚ÄúOona‚Äù in the story was a girl named Sally Hayes. Though he found her extremely irritating he thought she was very attractive as well. After spending a day with her, he pointed out about a dozen instances where he thought she was being ‚Äúphone as hell‚Äù. By the end of their only meeting in the book, Holden says to Sally, ‚ÄúYou give me a royal pain in the ass if you want to know the truth.‚Äù The real life Oona O‚ÄôNeil ended up breaking it off with Salinger and married the famous actor, Charlie Chaplin.
Despite Holden being a sixteen year old teenage boy he acts much older than his age. One time in the story he has the chance to be with a prostitute but instead of acting like a pig, he starts to feel sorry for her and instead tried to have a conversation with her. He even offers to pay her for good conversation instead of for sex. He also stays alone in hotels randomly, drinks at bars and clubs often, and even tells people he‚Äôs older than he really is. But the reason I find his character mature and intellectual is for other reasons.
Holden does not hold money or material things to be really important. He is more excited to hang out with his kid sister than he is any other time in the entire book. He is content with something that would probably be boring to other guys his age.
Like many teenagers, Holden is often depressed. The way he deals with it most times actually breaks my heart in a way. He likes to talk to his deceased kid brother, Allie. He will take a real event that he can remember where he was talking with him and pretend he is talking to him again. He says, ‚ÄúI started talking out loud to Allie. I do that sometimes when I get very depressed.‚Äù It is really very heart wrenching to hear Holden talk about his brother. One of my favorite moments in the book is when Holden and Phoebe are talking in Phoebe‚Äôs room and she points out that Holden doesn‚Äôt like anything. Holden responds quickly by saying, ‚ÄúI like Allie. And I like doing what I‚Äôm doing right now. Sitting here with you and talking and thinking about stuff‚Ä¶‚Äù Phoebe says to Holden, ‚ÄúAllie‚Äôs dead-you always say that! If somebody‚Äôs dead and everything, and in heaven then it isn‚Äôt really--‚Äù. Holden interrupts her with his final comeback, ‚ÄúI know he‚Äôs dead! Don‚Äôt you think I know that? I can still like him, though, can‚Äôt I? just because somebody‚Äôs dead, you don‚Äôt just stop liking them, for God‚Äôs sake- especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that‚Äôre alive and all.‚Äù
One of the most beautiful things about ‚ÄòThe Catcher in the Rye‚Äô is the way Salinger uses symbolism. From Holden‚Äôs red hunting hat, to Jane Gallagher‚Äôs checker playing technique, Salinger wrapped up more than meets the eye into things you never would have dreamed. The main thing that drew me into this story is the realness of Holden‚Äôs character. He is a teenage boy with a teenage boy‚Äôs mind but seems to have far more common sense than anyone else around him. He is not a jock. He is not a math whiz or a science whiz. He is not really interested in sports. He sort of makes up his own category; a category that I call ‚Äòthe genuine‚Äô. He is on his own a lot and loves it at first, but happiness and love are meant to be shared with others. It has a much less meaning when by itself and he realizes it by the end of the novel. He is growing intellectually little by little throughout the whole book. He realizes what really makes him happy. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like to read a story that could possibly change the way they view the world. I have honestly laughed outloud to myself as I read this story. Yes, there is talk about drinking, sex, and lots of cussing, but if you are going to avoid reading this story because of that then your missing out on a beautiful masterpiece."
22,Stephen,The Da Vinci Code ,"Aug 24, 2008",3,"OKAY PEOPLE‚Ä¶someone let me in on the gag because between the cries of ""Greatest Book of Greaty Greatness EVER"" and the screams of ""Lamest Load of Lamey Lameness EVER"", my itty bitty brain is left very‚Ä¶ 


So post Hype-a-ganza, I finally got around to reading this popular, polarizing, pop culture icon and thought it was‚Ä¶.drum roll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶FINE(sigh). It was a solid read with a slight lean towards the ‚Äúeh‚Äù side of MEH and few moments of genuine ‚Äúthat‚Äôs neat.‚Äù I don‚Äôt see all the love and I don‚Äôt see all the rage. Other than the obvious religious flavor of the content, it reminded me of your typical page-turning, popcorn beach read and I thought it accomplished its goal in decent, if unremarkable, fashion. 

Now I have a strict ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask, don‚Äôt tell, don‚Äôt mock, don‚Äôt preach‚Äù approach when it comes to religiousness so I am going to ignore the bird-flipping Vatican bash aspects of the story, though I can certainly see people on both sides of the fence having ‚Äúepic rah rah‚Äù or ‚Äúepic fail‚Äù reactions and I respect that. For me, it didn‚Äôt move my needle much in either direction beyond my fondness for the ‚Äúbig hidden history mystery‚Äù which is something I generally really enjoy. 

The plot of this one has been talked to death and beyond so rather than adding one more jelly bean to the jar, I thought I would just run down a few likes and dislikes about the story and leave it at that. 


TURN ONS


1. Conspiracy theories: are just fully fun and I am a major sucker for plots concerning ‚Äúshadow‚Äù histories and secret people doing secret things behind secret doors for reasons that are SHHHHHHH. I love a good conspiracy. Find me a rumor involving  Kim Kardashian being a Bilderberger and using a secret banking pipeline running from Area 51 through Microsoft to the Saudi Royal Family and laundering vast monies to be used to coordinate the sale of Boise, Idaho to a mysterious consortium headed by  Jay Z and Justin Bieber who will then turn the city into a giant quasi-government facility used for the testing of alien ‚Äúcloning‚Äù technology‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and I am glued to my seat and ONE HAPPY FELLA. 

2. Knights Templar: As much as I love conspiracies in general, when you throw the Knights Templar into the mix, it‚Äôs gonna perk me up better than a latte enema. I am always in favor of having them show up as a lynch pin to any massive global plot. The Knights Templar are like caramel on ice cream and just make a good conspiracy better. I had a lot of fun with the rehash of the Templar‚Äôs place in the center of EVERYTHING. 

3. Symbology, Da Vinci and the Holy Grail (the IDEA): I thought the major plot components themselves were interesting and I enjoyed following the hidden clues, messages, riddles and the tie in to all of the famous historical artifacts. It was fun. I also liked the ‚Äúhistorical significance‚Äù of the search (i.e., the ‚Äúbig reveal‚Äù) and the implications to the world if revealed. 


TURN OFFS


1. Symbology, Da Vinci and the Holy Grail (the EXECUTION): As much as I enjoyed the plot concept, the execution of the story was often frustrating and occasionally insulting. I‚Äôm not talking about the clunky, ‚Äúserviceable at best‚Äù prose as that‚Äôs gotten enough play without my squirting lighter fluid on the bonfire. My issue is more with Dan feeling the need to ‚Äúspoon feed‚Äù me details about his ‚Äúoh so clever plot‚Äù so that my economy-sized brain could grasp it. 



For example, there would be a ‚Äúreveal‚Äù that I thought was interesting‚Ä¶.and then Dan would exhaust me with explaining EXACTLY what that meant and EXACTLY what the implications were and make sure I knew EXACTLY what he had told me. I get it Mr. Brown, heard you the first time. 

2. THRILLer killing amounts of PLOD: For a page turning, actiony thriller, there was just too much sideways movement of the plot and some really unnecessary amounts of plod to the narrative. Part of this has to do with the excessive ‚Äúhand holding‚Äù Dan does with his audience mentioned above. However, there are also WAY too much time spent slowing down to take a look around and where we are and where we‚Äôve been. I started getting the impression that Brown was trying to hit a particular page count for the book and didn‚Äôt have anything but filler to loan the pages with. This is never a good thing for this kind of story. 

3. The End: Not a big fan of the final resolution of the story and I found it very un climaxy and a bit of a let down. Once we have the big reveal, very little new information ever really got added to the picture and I felt like my curiosity should have been stroked a few more times than it was in the home stretch. This lack of satisfying climax left me with a serious case of ‚Äúblue brain.‚Äù 

Still, overall, this was a good, serviceable mystery-thriller that seems tailor-made for a warm afternoon on the sand. It isn‚Äôt great literature, or even good literature, but it is a good thriller, a good concept and, for the most part, fun. It seems to accomplish pretty much exactly what it set out to do. 

2.5 to 3.0 stars."
23,Paige,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Aug 03, 2012",2,"First, understand that I am editing this review after several outraged responses. I knew that ""Wrinkle"" was considered to be a classic, but I was unaware that it was considered a Beloved Classic Beyond Criticism. I read this in grade school and just REread it aloud, to my daughter. I didn't have a clear memory of it, though I remember that I loved the way it started. Now I realize why I forgot so much of it. I STILL love the first 3 chapters, and dislike the rest. But since some of you found (and WILL find, I'm sure) my review to be judgmental, harsh and undiplomatic (a review IS a critique, right?) to the point of insulting, I thought I'd do a little research, look over the book again, think about it some more. So I've edited this review. But I find I just can't retract my statements. They are my opinion, that's all, and I haven't changed my mind. I can only try to be open minded, be honest, and try to explain my thoughts & feelings more clearly. Otherwise, I'd be a simpering fake.

Like C.S. Lewis books (especially the last of his Chronicles of Narnia, The Last Battle), A Wrinkle In Time has strong, (heavy-handed, I think), overtones of Christian doctrine. I'm not anti-spiritual, but I have a personal discomfort with this kind of religious doctrine. (You many not, and that's fine.) But more than that issue, the book is an odd combination of intelligent hard science, interesting quantum science that is brushed over, and quotes from the bible. At least there are a few respectful mentions of other spiritual leaders from other cultures, and moral messages from classic literature and philosophers. I understand this combination garnered criticism from both religious fundamentalists as well as atheists and secular society. L'Engle has earned my respect for taking on the difficult and controversial marriage of science and religion. She has also earned my criticism for raising this issue and then failing to really grapple with it. It's treated lightly, as though it's a natural thing that should be easy to accept, in spite of the many holes and inconsistencies in her story. I wouldn't even mind, except that this book takes itself SO seriously! It's easy to imagine that a school teacher might use this book to demonstrate that Evolutionist Theory and Creationism can be combined, but I find science and religion to have a disjointed and uneasy coexistence in this book. One is always dropped abruptly for the other. Or at least, it seems so to me. 

Ok. Now that I have tackled that big one, let's move on. I found the characters rather flat, (the genius child, the misfit girl, the beautiful, genius, scientist mother who nonetheless stays home and cooks stew in bunsen burners while her husband has adventures). The story itself is made up of vague scenarios of conflict of the psyche and spirit, with the entire Universe at stake. L'Engle's metaphors are obvious and their manifestations flat. [SPOILER ALERT] There is a quest to fight a ""Darkness"" (oooh!) that wants to rid us all of individuality & free will. There are 3 beings who used to be stars before they died in the fight with the ""Darkness"" and became something beyond our comprehension. They can appear in any form to us, so that we have some way of processing their existence. They are, in fact, so beyond anything knowable that I can't feel much for them or say much about them, except that they make a convenient plot device for transporting the characters throughout the Universe and the story. Anyway, the ""Darkness"" takes over a planet which turns into a kind of sci-fi beehive, with brainwashed automatons. I found the planet to be delightfully creepy and would have liked to know more about it, (even if it seems suspiciously like a thinly veiled anti-communist warning message.) So guess what's doing the brainwashing? - a giant, evil, disembodied brain, called IT, who is personally responsible for spreading the Darkness across the Universe. Really? A brain? Doesn't anyone else find this simplistic and cliche? The main character defeats this brain by gushing love. I am quite sure that many, many readers were moved to tears by Meg's gushing, but I do not happen to be that kind of person. Before Meg realizes that she has the power to gush love, the crusaders tesser through time and space (no explanation of how the father can do this) to a fascinating planet with very interesting aliens who can't see, but have other senses. I'd have loved to know more about their society and these mysterious other senses, but again, these ideas aren't very developed.

These are the things in this book, and in L'Engle's writing that I love: As I mentioned, I love her courage in at least attempting a controversial issue like mixing science and spirituality. I love that this book has the heart to recognize love as the greatest power, and that it has the wisdom to recognize fear as one of the biggest weapons. I love that individuality prevails, and the romantic in me approves of the loving, whole family. I love that she has enough respect for children that she included difficult vocabulary and a few difficult concepts. Many children are far more capable of handling complex ideas than we give them credit for, especially if we expose them to these things early on. I love that L'Engle doesn't underestimate them in this way, at least initially, on the surface. Since my biggest problems with this book all involve my finding it simplistic, naive, and certain parts of it cliche & obvious, I wonder if I need to remind myself that it's meant for children. Perhaps children should be idealistic, or even naive, in the way that this book is. But then I wonder if that is another way of underestimating them. ESPECIALLY since I felt exactly the same way when I read this book as a child!

Wind In The Willows makes me feel closer to God, or a creative power (though there's some gushing in there too, at the end.) The Jungle Book explores social constructs and morals, more deeply and naturally, for me. A Sound Of Thunder blew my mind, in grade school, with its ""butterfly effect"" theory of the power and responsibility of each individual. All of these are childrens' books, though they span generations, and time and space, more gracefully than tessering did for me. I could name so many more. 

But, if A Wrinkle In Time opened your mind to new ideas, (instead of making you feel frustrated by light treatment of them), made you question some latent prejudice, (instead of feeling bored by obvious metaphors), lifted your spirits & made you cheer for bookish outcasts, (instead of feeling that no one is that one-dimensional) or cry for the love of a big sister & little brother, (instead of cringing when a version of ""I love you Charles Wallace"" appears 19 times in 2 pages), then it is a wonderful book. For you."
24,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),Romeo and Juliet,"Jul 23, 2019",5,"Romeo and Juliet is an enduring tragic love story between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet written by William Shakespeare. It is also a story of the family feud between the Montagues and Capulets and how it affects the romance between Romeo and Juliet. The story is set in Verona and Mantua in Italy.

I have more than a dozen friends who love to read works with romance as the central theme. I was surprised to see that most of them haven't read this masterpiece yet. If you are an ardent fan of romance or William Shakespeare, you should never miss the opportunity to read this book."
25,karen,Pride and Prejudice,"May 27, 2009",3,"it is official: now everyone on the planet has read this book. i was the last holdout, and being the last person (excluding those who are just being born...... now) i am sorry i didn't like it more. i knew going into it that i was not a jane austen girl; i had read two others and thought them bloodless and mercantile. but everyone said to me, ""well, you haven't read pride and prejudice is why you don't like her."" which i thought might be valid. but it's not. because i still don't care. this is not the greatest love story of all time. it's more like the most amiable alliance of compatible feelings that ends up in a mutually agreeable union and merging of fortunes and temperaments. i mean, really. this book needs heathcliff to come barreling in on a stallion all wet from the moors to ravish all five of these daughters and show them what a real man is all about. now there's a love story...

come to my blog!"

27,Lisa of Troy,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Jan 17, 2021",3,"See my video review here: https://youtu.be/hfJJDQOroho

This is a book written in 1979 which follows the story of Arthur Dent who is having a bad day because his house is about to be torn down to make way for a highway. However, he has more things to worry about because the Earth is about to be demolished to make way for the galactic highway. Arthur Dent and his friend Ford Perfect are scooped up from Earth just a second before it is wiped out. The two of them travel through the galaxy and encounter many different people along the way including a depressed robot.

The first half of the book was really funny. I was reading this with a family member, and we both were laughing out loud every couple of minutes. The second half of the book was less funny because it was more plot driven. This book won't be for everyone, because some of the humor is a bit dry. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I am not sure if the jokes will really translate that well to the big screen.

Overall, it was a quick read and pretty enjoyable. However, as mentioned earlier, the pacing felt a bit off but keep in mind this book was written in the 1970's before the 8 second attention spans developed by YouTube.

29,Tung,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jan 09, 2008",2,"There‚Äôs a reason I hate Oprah‚Äôs Book Club, and the reason is that I think she does a disservice to the millions of American women who adore her by recommending terrible books. Oprah‚Äôs problem is that rather than directing her legions of fans to classic books (or ones destined to become classics) with complex plots and fine writing, she directs them instead to crap like The Notebook. The Notebook and The Time Traveler‚Äôs Wife belong to the same genre ‚Äì you‚Äôve heard the term ‚Äúchick flick‚Äù? These two books are chick books, books whose romantic plots and themes are written to appeal to women, a device in books and film that do a disservice to the women‚Äôs rights movement. Niffenegger‚Äôs book revolves around a man who has a genetic disorder that randomly makes him travel backwards and forwards in time. He pops into and out of the life of a woman who ends up being his wife. The book revolves around the theme that love transcends time, and describes how the couple deals with the man‚Äôs time-traveling problem. This book gets some points for an original concept, but unfortunately, it is atrociously written. First, it‚Äôs way too long, almost 550 pages. Much of the length of the book is due to the author‚Äôs inclusion of every minute detail she can think of, as if an overabundance of detail makes the scene somehow more realistic. Secondly, there are tons of rants in the book, which is really just the author using her characters to voice her own tastes (for example, a whole scene devoted to punk music and the punk scene as if the author were reliving her youth, which adds nothing to the characterizations). Thirdly, the book is filled with tiresome clich√© love imageries. For example, the time traveler wishing to himself that he were home and finding himself in bed with his wife and stating something inane like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Clare, so I am home. I am home.‚Äù So awful, the author should be jailed. The only reason I don‚Äôt have this book ranked lower is that the end of the book deals with issues of death and separation and loss that genuinely touched me, but that‚Äôs more me being sentimental than the book‚Äôs ability to convey strong emotion. Read it if you like chick flicks."
30,Lisa of Troy,Charlotte's Web,"Aug 08, 2022",5,"Some Pig!

Charlotte‚Äôs Web is the story of an unlikely friendship between a runt of a pig named Wilbur and a spider named Charlotte. One day, Wilbur hears from one of the farm animals that he is destined to be Christmas dinner. However, one animal is determined to save him, Charlotte. She starts to weave messages into her web about how incredible Wilbur is. Will it be enough to save the pig?

When I was a child, I saw this movie and found it very moving. As an adult, I read this story, and I still think it is very moving, but I have a deeper respect for the symbolism.

Since January, I have been going full tilt with the readalongs so I put a pause on them. And, of course, I am regretting that decision. Because Charlotte‚Äôs Web is such a great book for discussion!

First, this book can be interpreted in a variety of ways. For example, Wilbur breaks free from his pen. All of the animals are giving him conflicting information about what he should do (run uphill, run downhill, etc.). While in a state of confusion, Wilbur is lured into his pen by the farmer with a bucket of slop. 

This reminded me of counteroffers in the workplace. Your corporation might be perfectly content with you working 24/7 in a dark closet in the back of the building, never to be seen or heard from, and at a low rate of pay. When you finally find another company who will actually treat you decently, your old company tries to lure you back into their fold with a tempting offer. Wilbur‚Äôs situation also reminds me of a classic abusive relationship where the person afflicted wants to leave but feels compelled to stay, especially without a clear plan for extraction from the situation.

Second, there are a lot of relationships in this book that give me pause. If you read my review on The Giving Tree, I absolutely hate it. But I love Charlotte‚Äôs Web. Maybe because Wilbur loves Charlotte in return? What do you make of Fern? Is Wilbur just a phase to her? Is Templeton really a friend or is he just a hired hand (and that‚Äôs all he wants to be)? Are you upset that Wilbur receives all the praise when it is really Charlotte that is extraordinary? 

My favorite character: Dr. Dorian. He seems to be the most sensible person of them all.

Third, I love this book because it encourages praise versus complaining. Charlotte spins kind words into her web about Wilbur, and he tries to live up to them. She doesn‚Äôt write, ‚ÄúNeeds Bath‚Äù into her web. Instead, she spins a positive adjective. 

What do you think of Charlotte spinning the word, ‚Äúhumble‚Äù? Do you think that being humble is a bad thing in this day and age?

Overall, this book is deeply moving, has beautiful illustrations, provides a lot of valuable food for thought, and the action is fast paced.

31,Argona,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Aug 16, 2013",5,"I became fascinated with Japanese culture when I was a teenage girl and since then I have read many Japanese-related books and articles and have watched many movies and animes that depict parts of Japanese culture but the fact remains that I am not Japanese, I have never been to Japan and I am a foreigner, captivated by this exotic and very different culture.

As a foreigner, I see many beautiful and unique aspects to Japanese culture but I also know about certain painful historical facts such as treatment of women in certain eras of Japan. My point is, I don‚Äôt want to discuss accuracy of this book regarding Geisha life. I am not Japanese and I am not a historian and therefore, I am not qualified to judge. So I keep my opinion and impression Geisha to myself.

It appears that this story is based on the life of a certain geisha, but the author clearly states that both the story and characters are fictional and I am going to stick with that.

I admit that I was disappointed when I realized that this turned out to be fiction, only and only because I had been told otherwise by author himself while reading the preface. I mean, what‚Äôs with the contradiction? I couldn‚Äôt understand the pretense. Why pretend this is a real story when it‚Äôs a beautiful fiction? What‚Äôs wrong with fiction? I admit, as I reached the end of the book, I came to realize why the author tried to portray this story as a real life story when writing the introduction but I will write about that later.

I liked the writing style. Some people may find it pretentious but I understood that this is an attempt to write as close as possible to Japanese style of writing and story-telling and to seem poetic. The writing also helped me to see the world through Chiyo‚Äôs eyes and better understand her mind. I should mention that Chiyo and Sayuri are the same person.

Some people may say, parts of the story drag on and on and yet nothing important happens. I quickly get bored but I couldn‚Äôt put this book down once I had started reading and I had already seen the movie years ago. This is not a perfect book but it is an amazing one. Little Chiyo simply captivated me with her story.

I wanted her to survive, to fight and to find happiness. There isn‚Äôt a single character in this story that I actually hate. They are all different human-beings with flaws of their own that struggle to survive and get by their hard lives. Some choose to do so by crushing others and some choose to do so by fighting their way through and lending a helping hand when they can.

I might have had a few explosions regarding treatment of women and the way chiyo‚Äôs mind operates if I didn‚Äôt know Japanese culture at the time of this story well enough. I have Japanese friends, so I know what I am talking about it.

Chiyo is quite young when she falls in love with a man much older than her, too young in my opinion to fall in love but I understood her feelings. The moment she meets the love of her life, Chairman, is a turning point in her story and happens to be my most favorite part.
Yes, she focuses her entire life on reaching this man. As a woman, I would have liked her to have bigger goals and dreams of her own and for example, seek freedom or independence but when I think about her situation, her education and upbringing, I get her.

Chiyo is a slave, being trained for the sole purpose of pleasuring men. Men that mean nothing to her and are like alien beings. Up to this point, not a single person has shown her any kindness without ill intentions and when she is about to lose her faith in humanity, a man appears out of nowhere and shows her true kindness. Finally, a man means something to her. One of these men that she is supposed to serve has a face and value to her. I am not surprised she made it her life-purpose to reach him. I would have liked her to interact more with him during the course of the story but it wasn‚Äôt really necessary. Chairman was the man SHE wanted and SHE desired for herself. Considering her life, that was a big goal. And I didn‚Äôt really need to know more about Chairman. He was the symbol of true kindness. Her dedication to reach him was moving and touched me very deeply.

As I said before, during parts of this story, nothing important really happens, but I was eager to learn more about Geisha life. The author is obviously well-informed and has done his research. The story was interesting enough. All characters seemed real and relatable. I even liked Hatsumomo! And even though I wanted Chiyo to reach the love of her life and therefore happiness more than anything, I liked Nobu a lot too. He was a great man but it‚Äôs not like we can change our emotions or how we feel about different people and their behaviors whenever we want to. I could feel Sayuri‚Äôs misery and fear as she had to make decisions that would ultimately hurt people dear to her, from Pumpkin to Nobu. Sayuri is simply human. She too acts selfish and neglects her friends. I don‚Äôt blame her but I wish she had acted differently at certain times, at least regarding poor Pumpkin.

I also clearly felt the touch of war and the darkness that spreads over hearts and souls at such a time. The fear, pain and misery as everything changes and there is no longer any certainty to the future.

I was touched by the relationship between Chairman and Nobu, even though it was only behind the scene and between the lines. Once you think about it, it was a very deep and touching bond. Although poor Sayuri had to suffer because of this very bond, I understood why Chairman had to act the way he did.

The only part of the book that made me laugh and shake my head at the author, the AMERICAN author, was the part regarding American soldiers throwing candy at children. It was mentioned abruptly and I found it very funny. Two nuclear bombs and this is what Sayuri comments about. Yes, I am sure American soldiers weren‚Äôt as scary as they were supposed to be but they were still invaders. It takes time for certain wounds to heal. It‚Äôs not about American soldiers. It‚Äôs about war, invasion and loss!

At the end, this is not a fairy-tale. I am a fan of fairy tales and I firmly believe in happy endings. Ironic, since in real life, I am very realistic and even cynical. But when I open a book, I want happy endings. Somewhere along the way, I had started to dream of a fairy-tale style happy ending for little Chiyo and reading the last pages of the book left me a little sad. That‚Äôs why as I mentioned above, it was after finishing the book that I understood why the author has tried to sell this story as a real one. All throughout the book, the story tries to remain realistic(Which is why sometimes nothing really happens) and it's important to remember this, when reading the bittersweet ending, Otherwise, the ending might feel a little unsatisfactory and even rushed. But the truth is, the bittersweet ending was still a happy ending, just a realistic one. Still, I wasn‚Äôt 100% happy with it. I agree that the author could have done better just by adding 50 pages or so.

In conclusion, this is the beautiful story of a little innocent girl as she fights her way through life and hardships in an unfair society and struggles to reach her loved one and have a reason to simply wake up every day and live. This is not a fairy tale but it does contain certain elements of those tales therefore this book is not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it and find it very memorable and special."
32,Kim,Crime and Punishment,"Jan 22, 2018",1,Writing this was a crime and reading it was a punishment.
33,Elizabeth,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Sep 06, 2008",5,"I have loved these books my whole life. They are frequently misread, I think, by people who insist that everything in Narnia has to ""equal"" something in our world (Aslan=Jesus, Calormens=Muslims, Tash=Satan, etc.) While Lewis is clearly writing about God, as I read it, he is imagining how the Christian God might reveal himself in another world rather than allegorizing our own. Aslan is not ""Jesus,"" but rather the earthly aspect of God as he reveals himself in Narnia. The Calormens are not Muslims, but rather another culture in the universe of Narnia that worships another god. Tash, I suppose should be read as Satan as he reveals himself in the universe of Narnia, but again, the point is how these forces function in this fictional universe, not what the characters ""represent"" from our own world. Anyway, these books are great, and I encourage adults as well as children to give them a shot. All due respect to the movies, but as usual the books are much better."
34,Nilufer Ozmekik,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ,"Jul 06, 2018",5,"This is my new routine to reread HP books to take 
a trip down my memory lane because reading these remarkable books make me remember the times I was so excited to get my hands on them: the younger, crazier, stupider, less experienced, naiver but always happy version of myself. These books always bring out the noisy, mischievous, fiery, cheery child we hid inside the walls as we grow up.

But right now, I totally agree that we need revisions and new perspectives as the world changes: we definitely need spinoffs! We need to read stories with more cultural, racial and LGBTQ community representation. Creativity of intelligent mind shouldn‚Äôt be blocked by bleakness. 

Let‚Äôs wish we may get those spinoffs we dreamed of in near future!"
35,Emily May,Divergent ,"May 31, 2011",4,"Okay, okay, I completely understand why people could really like this and also why people could find it a huge disappointment. As for the latter... well, this was one of the most highly anticipated works of dystopian fiction to be released this year and the fact of the matter is that it just really doesn't work as a dystopia. Or, at least, what seems to be the general definition of a dystopia.

I can highlight the problem really well by referring to a conversation I had with my mum when she saw the book lying on the table.

mum: ooh, what's this book about?

me: I haven't started it yet but it's supposed to be a dystopia.

mum: [blank look] ??????

me: you know, like The Handmaid's Tale or 1984? Basically, it's where the author imagines a hypothetical world that's usually set in the future and takes a relevent political or social issue or issues and creates a fictional society that could possibly be what might happen if humanity was to follow a certain idea or movement or perhaps even carry on behaving the way they are. For example, failing to improve the world's environmental problems. 

[okay, that was a load of B.S. and I never talk so lah-di-dah with my mother, but the ideas were all the same]

....................................................................................................................

Anyway, the point is that Divergent has no political or social relevance and the fictional society is just not going to happen in a million years. If it was marketed as a fantasy, then perhaps you have something here. The world that the author has dreamt up is fantastical and too unrealistic for a truly good dystopian novel, the idea that there would be five factions who all believe the world's problems are down to one main issue that differs depending on which faction you consult is ludicrous... I mean, if only there were just five different opinions of what's wrong with the world.

And again with the bizarre: Dauntless. This is the faction that is in the limelight here and it has to be the most stupid of the lot. 

1) They think the world's problems can be solved by combating cowardice. That isn't even remotely believable.

2) They think that the way to prove their bravery is to jump off trains and beat each other up and almost get themselves killed for the sake of proving that they're not afraid to get themselves killed. Stupid, stupid, stupid. What's the point?

This isn't dystopia, it means nothing, it sends no message, it won't ever happen.



Alright, here it is: I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!

I know, I'm ashamed, I'm a traitor to real dystopian fiction everywhere. But I found the story so addictive, the characters so interesting and I was even completely won over by the intricate mysteries beneath this godawful stupid society that would never happen. I cared what happened to Tris and I cared whether her and Four would get it on and I cared what would happen if the factions went to war. I was hooked on this crap and I simply cannot deny it!

I think they should have just said it was a fantasy and it would have all been alright. I could forgive the stupid pretend world because in a fantasy pretty much anything goes. 

I know... I don't get it. I was reading this book and people were jumping off trains and punching each other in the face as part of pointless activities and I was thinking ""damn, that's stupid"" whilst my next thought was ""gosh, I wonder what's gonna happen next"". I had to read on. I still have to read on because somehow whatever happens in Insurgent has suddenly become very important to me.

I even liked the love story. Not that I don't like love stories normally but I usually give any dystopia or science fiction a hard time for having to squeeze a romance in there to make the book complete. But I was there with it. I liked both characters, I wanted it to work out. It's weird because Tris actually becomes increasingly hard and selfish as the novel moves on... but strangely that's an important part of her coming to understand that you cannot live selflessly in a competitive world and that, though others matter, sometimes you do have to put yourself first. I really liked the changes and development of her character.

So, there you have it. It's a shitty excuse for a dystopia but I found it an extremely enjoyable read."
36,Lisa of Troy,Anne of Green Gables ,"Sep 05, 2023",4,"Heart-Warming And Charming But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Anne of Green Gables has a lot going for it. I read the adorable pink Puffin Classic hardcover version while listening to my *free* audiobook from Audible narrated by none other than Rachel McAdams (the actress from The Notebook).

This book is so good that I picked up a stray reader while listening to the audiobook.

Set in Canada, an elderly couple, Matthew and Marilla, want to adopt a tween orphan boy to help them with chores around the farm. However, due to some miscommunication, the couple receives an opinionated, outspoken, imaginative girl, Anne. The couple quickly becomes smitten with her and decides she can stay.

Montgomery perfectly captures the essence of these formative years where one questions one‚Äôs identity. Anne contemplates the exact name she would like to be called and even the spelling.

In 1908, when Anne of Green Gables was first published, strong female characters in literature were not as prevalent. And, of course, I am a sucker for books with strong female leads.

However‚Ä¶

The premise of this story is faulty. In my experience, people on a farm still have work to do. Instead of just being bewitched by Anne‚Äôs charm, I wish she would have helped more around the farm and used her imagination to improve things.

There is a thin line between visionary and imagination, and, disappointingly, this line was never explored.

Further, Anne has a friend, Diana, whose path veers from Anne‚Äôs. However, her storyline seems to be suddenly dropped. Did she get married? What did she do with her life?

Also, some of the paragraphs were too long. Anne would go on and on, and, while I understand the author wants to convey that Anne is excited and talkative, this point is a bit overdone.

Anne of Green Gables is better than Little House on the Prairie but not quite as good as Little Women.

37,Matthew,Nineteen Eighty-Four,"Jan 08, 2013",5,"Yes! This book! Amazing! Terrifying, brutal, intricate, prophetic - and, in one big word, GENIUS!

This was a reread - the last time I read this was over 20 years ago and I wanted to see if the 5 star rating and its standing in one of my top 3 favorite books held up - and it most certainly does.

If this book was written today in the midst of the slew of dystopian novels that come out, it may not have stood out. But, this book was way ahead of its time. Written in a post WWII era where the fears of dictatorships and brutal tyranny were fresh in the minds of the people, this book plays off that fear and adds a dark vision of a potential future.

This is where the genius of Orwell comes in. The book is mainly the manifesto of the Party that the main character is seeking to rebell against. But, the ideology and descriptions of this dystopian world are not presented in a boring way - they are fascinating. The fact that Orwell created this world and laid out not only a terrifying political environment, but the rules for the new language they were creating, is beyond amazing. 

Finally, some of the things he describes sound all too possible in our current world. The controversial elections this week in the US only added to the intensity of this book.

Read this! Especially if you are a fan of modern dystopia, you must read the fore fathers - 1984 and Brave New World.

And, remember - Big Brother is watching!"
38,Valeriu Gherghel,Un veac de singurƒÉtate,"Jul 06, 2019",4,"MƒÉ tem cƒÉ multƒÉ lume a rƒÉmas cu impresia cƒÉ ‚Äûrealismul magic‚Äù e inven»õia lui Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez.

I thought I was in for a sweet romance but all I got was a time traveler who cheated at the lottery, beat people up for clothes, and engaged in sexual hijinks with time traveling versions of himself.

I was completely creeped out by the fact that Henry is Clare's best friend from the time that she was 6. She was groomed from that young age to be his wife, no matter that it wasn't consummated until later. How awful is that. When she is essentially date raped, she doesn't go to the police, Clare goes to Henry who engages in some vigilante justice. It was horrible what happened to her, but she should have reported it to the authorities.

The yuck factor from a bunch of places absolutely ruined the book for me not to mention that fact that Clare never really had a childhood or life at all without Henry in it. That's not romantic, it's sad.

Anyway, my apologies if you loved it. Like I said, I am willing to consider other opinions on this book- I just really can't recommend it."
40,karen,The Fault in Our Stars,"Jan 21, 2012",4,"you have a choice in this world, i believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice.

john green, like his characters, always makes the funny choice. and readers, like ""women"" are really just looking for a sense of humor. and the sense of humor goes a long way towards pardoning other sins. because come on, john green - your characters are so unlikely. ordinarily, i would squirm at such clever,verbose,insightful, literary-reference-dropping teenagers. but they are so funny and charming, always. your humor is what saves you from my criticism. 

(view spoiler)[Augustus was amazing, but he'd overdone everything at the picnic, right down to the sandwiches that were metaphorically resonant but tasted terrible and the memorized soliloquy that prevented conversation. It all felt Romantic, but not romantic. (hide spoiler)]

not really a spoiler, but best be on the safe side. (and i can't believe i had to use capital letters there. felt...unnatural) but the point of that is - ah, to have been able, at seventeen, to take the emotional out of the equation and view the situation so critically. for me, anyway - it wouldn't have happened. i would have been overwhelmed with gratitude and any more intellectual approach to the situation would have been inconceivable.

but who cares - i don't even know why i went on that boring tangent. because john green (when i say his name, you should see little hearts coming out from my ears - ‚ô•john green‚ô•) has enough skills to make these potentially unbelievable characters consistently entertaining and to do the unthinkable of making a YA cancer book very very funny. 

when i was an emotion-blinded teen, reading all those lurlene mcdaniels books, who knew that someday, there would be funny Ya-tragedy books? 

this is not funny:



but john green is. and i'm sure if i read Six Months to Live now, it would feel manipulative and cloying. (but i would probably still love it with all my nostalgia) this book is not at all manipulative and never cloying. it's all wisecracking in the valley of the shadow of death, in a genuinely funny, not snarky, way. okay, occasionally snarky. they are teens, after all.

(jesus, i may have forgotten to mention that this book is funny. did i? mention it?)

but it is also about the dangers of hero-worship and the desire to leave something in the world that is yours after you go, and anne frank (yes. anne freaking frank) 

‚ô•john green‚ô• is just a skillful and sophisticated YA author, who has really raised the bar for realistic YA everywhere. (baffling an 85-year-old co-worker of mine who wanted to write to our company to have this reclassified as adult fiction because he read it, not knowing anything about it, and figured it was a mistake. ""no, he's a teen novelist."" ""but the new york times reviewed it as an adult novel."" ""incorrect. it says ""teen"" on the dust jacket. printz award. you just read a YA book, dude! hhahaahahahaa! and you liked it!! score for YA!!"" (this last sentence did not actually happen, but the rest of it did))

great isaac and augustus relationship - he does boy-friends so well. great parents for hazel. great job as a female narrator. (and a definite departure from the margo/alaska girl this time.) great great great. (also, funny)

so - four stars. because after serious reflection, i still think paper towns is better, and needs to bask in its five-stars-from-karen-dom all alone. also - this book did not make me cry, goddamn it. i thought it would be an easy cry. but no. damn these eyes.

-	Victor Hugo, Les Mis√©rables (translated by Julie Rose) 


I wanted a reading challenge. 

This was a reading challenge. 

At 1,376 pages, the Julie Rose-translated, unabridged version of Les Mis√©rables is one of the longest single volumes I have ever read. More than sheer length, though, is that length‚Äôs composition. This is not an A-to-B type of story. This is A-to-Z, with stops along the way to ponderously scrutinize each and every other letter, describing its shape, its genealogy, and its place in the fabric of the universe. 

By the end, I was exhausted, hammered into submission by Victor Hugo‚Äôs unwillingness to use one word when an entire chapter will do. The conclusion, I recall, was absolutely beautiful; and yet, by the time I reached that endpoint, all my patience had long since disappeared.

Or perhaps it simply assumed a false identity and retreated to Montreuil-sur-Mer in northern France.

*** 

Despite its prodigious size, summarizing Hugo‚Äôs famous novel is rather easy, given the fame of its derivative works. At the center of Les Mis√©rables is Jean Valjean, imprisoned for nineteen years for stealing bread (and subsequently attempting to escape several times). Finally released, he soon realizes that society is not ready to accept him, despite paying for his crimes. He is hounded by the upright and sanctimonious bloodhound Inspector Javert. As he is chased, Jean Valjean comes into contact with Cosette, an orphan who he raises as his own. Eventually, Jean Valjean, Cosette, Inspector Javert, and a supporting cast of many dozens of others, find themselves on the cobbled streets of Paris during the June Rebellion of 1832. 

This story is told in inimitable fashion by an author of extraordinary talents. Say what you will about Hugo ‚Äì and I shall! ‚Äì the man had unique abilities. 

First, he has an extraordinary way with characters. Most of the individuals in Les Mis√©rables are a mile wide and an inch deep; that is, they tend to be either white-hats or black-hats (though in some cases, the black-hats undergo near-religious conversions). Nevertheless, he imbues even the most tangential characters with some memorable detail, with some humanizing aspect. One of my favorites was Monseigneur Bienvenu, the Bishop of Digne, a man who has only one small role to play in this tale, and yet is given a full-dress biography before disappearing offstage. 

Second, Hugo is a master of describing a particular place at a particular time. It is not long ago that the world held its breath, transfixed, as Notre-Dame de Paris threatened to crumble before our very eyes. That event sent people rushing to The Hunchback of Notre Dame, for the reason that Hugo‚Äôs rapt descriptions had helped save the cathedral in the first place. While Notre-Dame is only fleetingly referenced here, Hugo still delivers a lengthy love letter to Paris, soliloquizing on the granular level, creating a written-word, street-by-street map. If you ever find yourself in a time machine heading to 1830s France, take this as a guide. 

Finally, Hugo knows how to create a set piece. Much of Les Mis√©rables is given over to essays and exposition (Hugo will barely allow a character to take a step without delivering a history of the shoe). Sprinkled amidst these word-bogs, however, are some crackling scenes that Hugo carefully builds and skillfully executes. There is a slick chase, a fraught standoff, and a visceral street battle, all of which demonstrate why Les Mis√©rables is so often adapted. 

Okay. So that was the good stuff. I wanted to get that out of the way so we could talk about the real issue. Even as an avowed big-book lover, this book is too damn long. 

***

Les Mis√©rables suffers from a near-fatal case of literary edema. It is swollen out of all proportion to its subject. 

I know what you‚Äôre going to say: Abridgment. 

To which I reply: Gross. 

I don‚Äôt do abridgments. Abridging a book is like kissing an eager and willing cousin. It might be easy, but it ain‚Äôt right. 

When I read a novel, I want it to be on the original terms, as mediated by author and editor. As far as I know, this is the version that Hugo wanted; thus, this is the version on which I will judge him. 

(I cannot judge the translation, other than to say I liked it. There were a few clunky moments and some dialogue that seemed a bit anachronistic as it tried to convey a modern flavor. Overall, I often forgot this was a translation, which is a good thing). 

The style employed by Hugo is digressionary to the extreme. Remember when you were young, and it took your mom and dad forever to get to the point? Well, just thank your lucky stars that you weren‚Äôt raised by the French romantic poet, dramatist, and novelist Victor Hugo! Because I can guarantee that it would take him a week to explain why you shouldn‚Äôt be sneaking out of your room. 

The digressions in Les Mis√©rables take many forms. Some are simply a function of overexplaining. For instance, as noted above, we did not need to know everything about the Bishop of Digne in order for him to perform his one crucial act. Similarly, the incidental meeting of two characters at the battle of Waterloo did not require an epic recapitulation of the famous clash. To the contrary, that intersection could have been effectuated in a sentence or ‚Äì if we‚Äôre getting paid by the word ‚Äì a paragraph. This overexplaining can be a bit taxing, but it is also ably handled and adds a sort of mythical overlay to the narrative. 

The other digressions, however, serve only to distract, to burden, to annoy. The essays are the worst. In contemporary times, perhaps, they might have served a purpose. Not any longer. There is, to take one example, a critique on monasticism. I will allow that when Hugo wrote this, convents might have been a great danger to the world. Now, it fails to make the list of ‚ÄúOne Trillion Things I‚Äôm Worried About.‚Äù At page 805, the reader is treated to Hugo going meta on us, as he delivers 20 pages about the use of slang in a novel. Again, this has no present-day relevance in a world in which realistic dialogue (utilizing slang, specific speech patterns, or terms of art) are the norm. 

Hugo‚Äôs digressions are inexcusably disruptive and antithetical to all notions of pacing and flow. He is like the speedbump on the Indy 500 track, the blind dogleg on the interstate. Every time Les Mis√©rables gets some momentum going, Hugo yanks on the leash. It almost seems an intentional act, as though he is troubled by the thought of his novel being too entertaining. I can accept, as I noted above, the idea that an author might find it necessary to explain the history of a sewer system, before a character attempts to escape through it. What I cannot accept, though, is how this history is presaged by a disquisition on poop that manages to be simultaneously unneeded, gross, and a little racist.

(Yes, there is really an essay on poop. (view spoiler)[I shit you not. (hide spoiler)]) 

***

Classic novels tend to be challenging to read. It takes a certain amount of discipline and patience and maturity to appreciate them. There was a time, I will admit, that I opened certain books by the likes of Melville, Dickens, and Tolstoy, with a sneer already on my face, ready to puncture time-honored masterpieces with snark and sarcasm (though I stand by every unkind word I uttered about Moby Dick). 

I opened Les Mis√©rables cognizant of its challenges, but truly (I believe) openminded as to its quality. It therefore came as a surprise when about halfway through (or a mere 688 pages), I started to dread this. It became my anti-white-whale, a thing that obsessed me but that I wanted to avoid. A good book can lift your spirits and brighten your day; a bad one does the opposite. 

Of course, I am old enough now to recognize the arrogance inherent in calling a timeless work like Les Mis√©rables ‚Äúbad.‚Äù (Though arrogance is something that Hugo had in spades. After all, he wrote an essay on poop water and convinced you it was genius). This recognition led to a bit of meditation, as I tried to separate what I liked from what I didn‚Äôt, what worked from what failed. I tried to divine an answer as to why this excessive and overlong monument to protracted verbosity has endured.

Ultimately, I think it has to do with the fact that there is a lean, effective tale of bracing moral clarity within these pages. When we think of Les Mis√©rables, even if we haven‚Äôt read it, even if we haven't seen the famed musical, we conjure images of broken systems, of justice that will break a man‚Äôs back, of city streets abounding with poor children; and we applaud the message of charity, kindness, and goodwill that Hugo preaches. 

Of course, when we think of Les Mis√©rables, we also tend to forget that this simple and timeless message is nearly obscured by antimonarchical screeds and learned tracts on sewage."

The Written Review


Orphaned Mary Lennox had a sour face, bitter temperment and dismal dispostion.

But could you blame her? Nine years old and she was barely shown an ounce of affection. 

Her parents saw her as an accessory (to be paraded about for parties) and when they died, and Mary shipped off to live with a distant uncle...she felt just as alone as ever.

She spent her time on the Yorkshire moors exploring the surrounding gardens...and that's when she found a key. A curious old key that fit perfectly in a mysterious little door.

And then she realizes what she found. A secret garden.

The garden is rough, neglected and unloved...but Mary sees a spark. And so she pours love into this forgotten garden, and she soon finds out what it is like to be loved in return.

This is my first time I read this one...but wow. It was amazing. Why did I wait so long????

This was such an amazing, gorgeous and touching book.

Mary's story was absolutely compelling to read and I could NOT put it down. The way the garden was described made me want to pick up my shovel and head out to fix things up on my own.

And the conclusion of this story? Absolutely perfect.

Highly recommended!!"

Corr√≠a el a√±o 1866 y Fi√≥dor Dostoievski est√° atravesando uno de los peores momentos de su vida, el de mayor descontrol, que comienza a gestarse dos a√±os antes, luego de enredarse en un affaire amoroso con una estudiante suya, P√≥lina S√∫slova, se auto exilia en Europa mientras la vida de su primera esposa, Mar√≠a Dm√≠trievna va apag√°ndose por la tuberculosis. 
El autor hundido y vapuleado por el desarraigo, la infidelidad y especialmente por su adicci√≥n al juego est√° a la deriva. Ya han pasado aquellos cuatro a√±os de encierro infernal en la congelada prisi√≥n de Siberia, luego de haber sido condenado en 1849 por involucrarse con un grupo reaccionario antizarista.
Dostoievski paga una culpa tras otra, pero vuelve a caer. Su adicci√≥n a la ruleta lo ha llevado a empe√±arlo casi todo y para colmo de males, un editor, lo obliga a respetar un contrato, haci√©ndolo escribir en 29 d√≠as una novela que se llam√≥ ""El jugador"".
Pero este hombre incansable no se detiene. Corrige ""Pobres gentes"", su novela de 1846 y la relanza y a la par de ""El Jugador"", escrita contra reloj, comienza a dictarle su nueva novela a una taqu√≠grafa que √©l contrata. 
Se llama Anna Grig√≥rievna Sn√≠tkina, veinte a√±os menor que √©l y con el tiempo se transformar√° en su segunda esposa, le dar√° tres hijos y reencausar√°, ya al final de su existencia el orden econ√≥mico y mental del escritor. Ser√° su tabla de salvaci√≥n.
Pero volvamos a 1866. Dostoievski tiene un plan y es el de escribir una novela nueva, fresca, en la que exponga una tem√°tica que no se parezca a otra. Para ello se vale de un borrador escrito seis a√±os antes, en 1860, que se llam√≥ ""El diario de Rask√≥lnikov"", en primera persona en el que comienza a desarrollar el perfil psicol√≥gico de uno de los asesinos m√°s peculiares de la literatura, el de Rodion Rom√°novich Rask√≥lnikov.
Esta novela provocar√° una escisi√≥n en la literatura rusa. Casualmente, raskolnik significa ""escisi√≥n, cisma"" en ruso. Nunca m√°s acertado, puesto que Dostoievski sol√≠a jugar con los adjetivos para crear los apellidos de sus personajes.
Comienza a publicar ""Crimen y castigo"" por entregas y el p√∫blico r√°pidamente se interesa en la historia, puesto que tiene todos esos elementos tan adictivos que se relacionan con un crimen.
Para su novela, Dostoievski se vale de nutrirla con lo que √©l m√°s sabe manejar: el de la descripci√≥n del submundo de la ciudad que m√°s conoci√≥, San Petersburgo. Considero que luego de James Joyce, quien bas√≥ su obra en Dubl√≠n, es Dostoievski quien m√°s hizo hincapi√© en sus ciudad. Nadie la conoci√≥ como √©l.
Para entender las caracter√≠stica del entorno real de la ciudad, podemos apoyarnos El Naturalismo, esa corriente literaria que se desprendiera del Realismo franc√©s y que ser√°, en cierta manera, reutilizada (no creo que conscientemente) por el autor ruso para darle forma de acuerdo a lo que sucede en su Rusia natal. 
Diferenci√°ndose un poco de Zol√° o De Maupassant, Dostoievski muestra claramente el costado m√°s s√≥rdido, cruel y descarnado de la clase baja petersburguesa en donde la pobreza y el fr√≠o sacude a ni√±os y mujeres desvalidas de la forma m√°s brutal. El autor lo describe sin ocultar nada, ni siquiera la manera en que las clases superiores se aprovechan de los pobres, sea utilizando maltrato, castigos o abuso sexual. Todo estaba permitido en esa √©poca. Ni ni√±as ni mujeres ten√≠an derechos. Eran tratados como animales.
Yendo a la historia de Rask√≥lnikov, uno reconoce al instante que es atrapante y absorbente. Este muchacho, es un estudiante vapuleado por sus extra√±as teor√≠as que hablan de dividir a la sociedad en dos partes, la de la gente vulgar y la gente extraordinaria, siendo esta √∫ltima la que, por ser superior tiene justificado el acto de matar: por una acci√≥n mala, se justifican cien acciones buenas.
Seguramente habr√° inspirado a Nietzsche, junto con otro libro del autor, ""Memorias del subsuelo"", a desarrollar la idea del ""superhombre"". De hecho en ""Memorias del subsuelo"", este concepto est√° muy marcado. Ese narrador es a√∫n m√°s despiadado que Rask√≥lnikov.
Sumado a su confusi√≥n con la grandeza de Napole√≥n, Rask√≥lnikov comenzar√° a idear el asesinato de una vieja usurera, argumentando tambi√©n que es una manera de ayudar a todos esos pobres necesitados que deben empe√±ar sus cosas para poder comer. Cortando el mal de ra√≠z, los libera del sufrimiento.
Todo este razonamiento comenzar√° a cuajar hasta que hace eclosi√≥n en ese instante donde con un hacha Rask√≥lnikov sella su destino irrevocablemente. Una vez consumado el crimen, comienza el torturante castigo y se extender√° hasta el final de la novela.
Es que las cosas no salen seg√∫n lo planeado y con el asesinato adicional de Lizaveta, la hermanastra de la vieja todo se complica terriblemente.
Algunos ven en la novela de Dostoievski una cr√≠tica a la juventud de su √©poca, que se encuentra descantada, sin nada que hacer y sin rumbo. Otros, indudablemente lo asocian a la disparidad social que atravesaba la Rusia zarista y un gran grupo de cr√≠ticos, basa su teor√≠a en el excepcional tratamiento psicol√≥gico que el autor hace de su personaje principal y que encadenar√°, como si fuera una tragedia shakesperiana, en otros de sus libros claves que son ""El idiota"" y ""Los demonios"" para cerrar todo perfectamente en ""Los hermanos Karam√°zov"".
Podemos establecer claramente que en esta novela, al igual que en las que le seguir√°n, el autor pondr√° en tela de juicio la existencia de Dios y las atribulaciones de la fe, traspasando muchos de sus cuestionamientos emp√≠ricos a sus personajes.
La mente de Rask√≥lnikov es sumamente compleja. Lo que inicialmente justifica se le vuelve en contra y lo atormenta, lo enferma y lo enfrenta a su familia y amigos. Est√° tironeado por distintas fuerzas las cuales, seg√∫n mi interpretaci√≥n difiere de la posici√≥n de algunos cr√≠ticos que establecen que su amigo Raz√∫mijin resume el lado bueno de Rask√≥lnikov y Svidrig√°ilov su lado malo.
Yo puedo ver en Rask√≥lnikov tres voces de la conciencia y no dos: en primer lugar, Razumijin representa (esto s√≠ lo comparto), la conciencia terrenal, basada en la amistad y el aprecio que este joven siente por √©l y adem√°s, teniendo en cuenta que su apellido significa ""sensatez"" o ""cordura"" en ruso.
En segundo lugar, pongo a Sonia (Sof√≠a Marm√©ladova), apoy√°ndose en el lado afectivo, el del amor y por √∫ltimo y m√°s importante, el de su propia mente, que es la que ejerce la tortura psicol√≥gica que lo consume.
Veo, s√≠, en Svidrig√°ilov y muy especialmente en Porfirii Petr√≥vich, el juez de instrucci√≥n que investiga el asesinato de la usurera a las otras amenazas que se suman a su torturada conciencia. Svidrig√°ilov, con su manera taimada y ventajera que tiene para recordarle que tiene en cierta manera bajo su control a la hermana de Rask√≥lnikov, Advotia ""Dunia"" Rom√°novna para de este modo presionarlo. Por el otro nos encontramos con una mente brillante, la de Porfirii Petrovich, al que posiciono en el mismo lugar que aquellos grandes detectives de la literatura. Porfirii interiormente sabe e intuye lo que sucedi√≥ con el asesinato de la vieja y nunca deja de creer que Rask√≥lnikov tiene que ver con esto.
El resto de los personajes tiene una importancia necesaria para el desarrollo de la historia, principalmente su madre Puljeria Aleks√°ndrovna (los apellidos rusos son terribles para quien no lo es pero debe leerlos, escribirlos y pronunciarlos), el oficial Il√≠a Petr√≥vich, el funcionario Semi√≥n Zaj√°rich Marm√©ladov, padre de Sonia y tambi√©n, en gran parte de la historia conoceremos a Katerina Ivanovna, la esposa t√≠sica de Marm√©ladov. Gran incidencia tienen todos estos personajes en el argumento.
Sobre el final, en el Epilogo, Dostoievski rememorar√° sus terribles d√≠as en el presidio de Siberia y te√±ir√°, entre el desasosiego y la esperanza, al personaje de Rask√≥lnikov para comenzar a construir su idea de redenci√≥n, pero para llegar a esto, deberemos leer much√≠simas p√°ginas.
Es la segunda vez que leo ""Crimen y castigo"", y cuando estaba terminando de leer el libro, comenz√≥ a sonar en m√≠ la canci√≥n m√°s famosa de Queen, ""Rapsodia Bohemia"". 
Prest√© atenci√≥n a la letra y por alg√∫n mecanismo entend√≠a que la letra de esa canci√≥n concuerda pr√°cticamente en todo (menos con la cuesti√≥n faustiana) con la historia de Rask√≥lnikov y por momentos la exactitud de hechos entre libro y canci√≥n son iguales. 
Resumiendo la canci√≥n transcribo estos versos y me animar√≠a decir que este tema ser√≠a, en el eventual caso de que existiera una banda sonora de ""Crimen y castigo"", el principal:

""Atrapado en un derrumbamiento / No hay escape de la realidad / S√≥lo soy un pobre chico /No necesito compasi√≥n /No me importa de que lado sople el viento. /Mam√°, acabo de matar a un hombre / Demasiado tarde, mi hora ha llegado / Escalofr√≠os atraviesan mi espina dorsal / El cuerpo me duele todo el rato / Adi√≥s a todos, tengo que partir, / Tengo que dejarlos atr√°s y enfrentar la veredad / Mama, ooooh / No quer√≠a hacerte llorar / Si no regreso ma√±ana Sigue adelante / sigue adelante como si realmente nada importase / Nada importa en realidad / Cualquiera lo puede ver / Nada importa en realidad / Nada importa en realidad para m√≠ / All√° donde el viento sople.""

Leer este aut√©ntico tour-de-force psicol√≥gico llamado ""Crimen y castigo"" es un volver a darnos cuenta de que Fi√≥dor Dostoievski es un escritor imbatible. 
Esta novela es un verdadero desaf√≠o y una maravillosa experiencia que todo lector debe enfrentar al menos una vez en la vida."

Another great reread of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Always entertaining and so absurdly profound!
 ~~~

Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an entertaining romp through the galaxy. It's a book I've read several times (first in high school); however, after reading Kurt Vonnegut's most overtly science fiction novel, The Sirens of Titan, it almost felt like a fresh experience. Of course, Vonnegut and Adams are very different writers. Still, the influence of Vonnegut is evident in Adams' seminal novel of nerd culture. The absurdity of the human condition explored in Sirens (something which Vonnegut refuses to take seriously but can't treat as a punchline either) gets a funny and entertaining twist in Adams' work. While I view Sirens as a better novel, it took Adams to turn that absurdity into such an entertaining adventure."

‚ÄùIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.‚Äù

Okay, here‚Äôs the thing: There are already 96.502 reviews about this book on goodreads and I think it‚Äôs safe to say that mine will carry no weight. *lol* 
So I decided to make this a short ‚Äúmy thoughts about this book‚Äù review. ;-P

1.)	‚ÄùThirty-six,‚Äù he said, looking up at his mother and father. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs two less than last year.‚Äù 

I totally forgot how horrible the Dursleys are and I think I kind of suppressed how dreadful Dudley is! Such a spoilt brat and this is actually putting it more than just lightly. If anyone should go to a boot camp sort of school it certainly should be him. 

2.)	‚ÄùAh, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,‚Äù said Hagrid. ‚ÄúHarry ‚Äì yer a wizard.‚Äù

Bless Hagrid for being the kind and compassionate man that he is! <3 Those lines went down in Harry Potter history and started it all! XD

3.)	‚ÄùBlown up a toilet? We‚Äôve never blown up a toilet.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGreat idea though, thanks, Mum.‚Äù

Haha! You gotta love the Weasley twins! They might be side characters but they always manage to bring some humour into the book and they succeed to give that typical sibling and family vibe. =)

4.)	‚ÄùAre you sure that‚Äôs a real spell?‚Äù said the girl. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not very good, is it? I‚Äôve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it‚Äôs all worked for me.‚Äù

When I read this I totally had the Hermione of the movie in my mind. Emma Watson played her so well and I‚Äôm really glad that Hermione came off her high horse. She was really insufferable at the beginning of the book. *lol* 

5.)	‚ÄùYou‚Äôll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don‚Äôt want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.‚Äù

Urgh! And so it begins! I never liked Malfoy and I‚Äôll never do. Sorry, guys! Yes, I felt sorry for him after book 5 but he‚Äôs still a slimy little spoilt brat at the beginning of the series. Still, if his parents would have raised him differently he might have even turned out to be a nice guy. *sighs* 

6.)	‚ÄùLet‚Äôs try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?‚Äù

And here comes another character I‚Äôll never forgive. Snape is a horrible teacher and an even worse human being. There I said it. Nothing that happens over the course of the following books will change anything about the fact that he‚Äôs unfair and mean to his students! His past doesn‚Äôt excuse his actions. Still, I gotta give Rowling kudos for all the foreboding! Boy, alone the comment with the bezoar. XD And Dumbledore explaining the relationship between Snape and Harry‚Äôs father. Well done! ;-)

7.)	‚ÄùBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can‚Äôt share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.‚Äù

I still love that scene and I‚Äôm really glad Hermione and the others finally bonded. Also, I love that they tried to be good kids at the beginning. In the first book they actually don‚Äôt want to do anything forbidden and feel bad about it. Well, and then the other books happen. *LOL* Apparently practice makes perfect though, because they go for plenty of forbidden things but don‚Äôt get caught anymore. Haha! 

8.)	‚ÄùAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I‚Äôm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.‚Äù

Lee Jordan is the best! <3 He‚Äôs the main reason I enjoy the Quidditch games so much! His commentary is just funny and brilliant! 

9.)	‚ÄùIf I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I‚Äôll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there. It‚Äôs only dying a bit later than I would have done, because I‚Äôm never going over to the Dark Side!‚Äù

I LOVE HARRY‚ÄôS DEFIANCE!!! That‚Äôs one of the many things that made me like him so much! He never backs down and always continues to fight. No matter the odds, he‚Äôs facing his troubles holding his head high! Even this early in the series you can already see that he‚Äôs going to be a great MC! 

And now let‚Äôs move on and read book two! ;-)"
49,Tim,Dracula,"Aug 01, 2021",5,"Over the years I've somewhat fallen out of reading classics, which is a damn shame as I typically enjoy the process of reading them even if I don't end up liking the book. In an effort to kick-start the process of reading them again on a more regular basis, I've decided to go with one I should have crossed off my list decades ago given my love of horror.

Dracula has been portrayed in so many different ways from all the different forms of media. He's been suave, sexy, violent, heroic, demonic‚Ä¶ he's even been cute and cuddly.

 
(Picture of my actual copy of the book along with one of my daughter's plushies)

So, it was an interesting experience, going back and seeing Stoker's original intent. So what was he?

I think he could best be described as an ever present entity who is only seen for around 30 pages or so. He has such little ""screen time"" for a title character and yet he's felt in every scene. He's a predator, something lurking in the shadows the entire time and the reader is just watching as those around him slowly piece together what he's doing.

I can only imagine that when this originally came out in 1897 that it caused a stir. While slow paced, it's frequently disturbing even by today's standards, particularly some of the scenes early on in Dracula's castle and some later when our heroes are staking out (pun intended) a graveyard. (view spoiler)[Also, yeah, Dracula's brides totally eat a baby... at least that is strongly implied. (hide spoiler)]

I confess, I'm not personally a big fan of epistolary novels. I majored in English and have read quite a few, but it's not a style that usually appeals to me. As silly as this may sound, I find I like it most in where it incorporates modern technology, such as chat logs or texts as it creates a multi-media aspect through current means of communication‚Ä¶ as such I actually love what Stoker did. He did 1890s equivalent, as there are diary entries, telegraphs, newspaper articles and even transcriptions of phonograph recordings. In fact, one of the most fascinating aspects of the novel to me was how prominent then current technology was, with descriptions of light-bulbs, recordings, blood transfusions and rapid transit through trains all aiding our heroes. This is in many ways a book about science conquering the dark and superstitions (though as Van Helsing is quick to note, sometimes superstitions have their reasoning and should be taken into account with science). It's a rather fascinating look at the topic.

My biggest surprise while reading (other than some of the frightening content), the thing that I will no doubt take away with some awe is that the book contains a cowboy. Yes, a cowboy. He's not a joke character, he actually serves a purpose‚Ä¶ but there's a random cowboy in the vampire hunt. I recently while looking this up on the internet (to find out if anyone was a shocked by said cowboy as me and WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL ME) found this gem and will close my review with it:



5/5 stars"
50,Morgan,The Giving Tree,"Apr 06, 2009",1,"Horrific relationship between a selfish unappreciative child and an enabling self-sacrificing mother who has no purpose in life other than to give herself away. I keep expecting a missing page to show up where he pisses all over the tree stump at the end.

I think this is offensive and despicable.

It is a horrible lesson for children. I'd rather see more literature that honors and respects the sacrifices that parents make, rather than this book's actual focus: demonstrating the expectations that this black hole of a child has.

I feel that sacrifice, without a concept of self, gives less weight to the sacrifice.

This could be rewritten with a hungry boy eagerly gnawing on the scraps that his mother is cutting off from her body."
51,Kerri,Fahrenheit 451,"May 24, 2011",3,"I heard that this was a great book, and I really wanted to like it. The title and the quips on the back cover caught my interest. Guy Montag is a fireman, but the job is flipped. Instead of putting out fires, he is creating them, and he likes it a lot. The first sentence, ""It was a pleasure to burn"", and the following description after, had me convinced that I would enjoy the book. Not only that, New York Times professes that the book is ""frightening in its implications"". With all that buildup and such a dramatic summary on the back, I was hoping that the book would make me think. Perhaps it would be a dark book, morbid, even offensive. It didn't deliver any of that, but that's not the problem; I don't judge a book based on whether or not it follows my preconceptions. It could have been a perfectly good book without any of that.

Maybe the writing style just didn't suit me. I was hoping that the book would be vivid, and one would expect that a book with so many descriptions and metaphors would be vivid. Nope, not for me. Everything is blurry. The people feel one dimensional, with the exception of Montag himself. The intended message feels flat. So, book censorship is bad, tv is bad. What am I supposed to think about it? 

My real problem is that I don't feel anything when I was reading Fahrenheit 451, except maybe frustration. Things like a woman burning with her books should make me feel something like horror or sadness. The book doesn't have any effect on me because the metaphors and flowery descriptions are so distracting. Half the time I feel that they don't contribute anything, and my mind automatically skips over them along with some potentially important material. Then I'll try to read it again, but nothing is retained except for bits of flowery fluff. The writing in the entire book is disjointed and strange, and that should have been fine, because such a style has potential for creating a disturbing, off feeling; that would fit a dystopian book. Instead, I feel uncomfortably distanced."
52,Gabriella Risatti,Jane Eyre,"Aug 27, 2007",1,"** spoiler alert **
           SPOILER ALERT. YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU PLAN ON READING JANE EYRE.

I read Jane Eyre for the first time as an adult and I can't help but feel sorry for every junior high or high school student who was forced to read this book. 

I thought getting through this book was very difficult. I assumed I would love it since I generally love books by Jane Austen, but I didn't find many similarities at all. Jane Eyre was boring and unbelievable. I did enjoy the first half of the book because I had such hope for her, but then it just became dull and unrealistic. I never bought the romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester, nor did I buy the coincidence of her happening to arrive on the doorstep of the only relations she has in all of England during her time of need. I also find it strange that she dedicates the last paragraphs of the book primarily to St. John Rivers, when he was such a small part of her life, not to mention the fact that the part he did play was primarily negative.

Bronte failed to draw me into the lives of these characters or like them, frankly, which made this a very long read for me."

54,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Oct 28, 2020",4,"Summary
 




Along with his friend, Arthur Dent escapes from Earth before it was demolished and goes for a hilarious yet intriguing trip through the galaxy. 


Some fascinating facts related to this this book 

I thought that this was a book mainly for the younger audience, and I wouldn't enjoy it. Then I accidentally came across an interview of Elon Musk where he discussed his Hitchhiker‚Äôs-Guide-inspired Design Philosophy and told that it was this book that inspired him to make SpaceX. That, at last, convinced me to read this book. And it was an absolute joy to read.





Why are so many people obsessed with this book? How did it influence Elon Musk‚Äôs design philosophy?

 For knowing more about it. I am sharing the excerpts from Elon Musk's interview here.


Science Fiction to Reality

Here Elon beautifully lays out the philosophical points from Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy, which have shaped the way he thinks through tough engineering challenges.


Elon Musks‚Äô Hitchhiker‚Äôs-Guide-inspired Design Philosophy

1. ""Question everything, including the question"".
As Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide teaches us, if you are given access to the Universe‚Äôs most powerful supercomputer‚Äîa system that can answer any question you throw at it‚Äîdon‚Äôt waste its time with a question you haven‚Äôt properly thought through. The same goes for a beautiful human brain.
When approaching any challenge, first ask yourself, ‚ÄúAm I asking the right question?‚Äù Alternatively, ‚ÄúAm I being asked the right question?‚Äù

2. ‚ÄúTake ages to form your question.‚Äù
The climax of the first book in the series focuses on relaying this lesson to its readers: If you don‚Äôt understand the question in the first place, you won‚Äôt understand the answer it produces.

3. ‚ÄúQuestion your constraints.‚Äù
The world of rocket science comes with a load of constraints: Time, physical, budgetary, the list goes on. But, Elon warns, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt design to your constraints without calling into question those constraints.‚Äù

4. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt optimize a thing that shouldn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù
We all find ourselves in the midst of a task that suddenly seems silly. ‚ÄúWhy am I doing this?‚Äù We are creatures of habit, and we are great at following orders. But, sometimes, we forget that orders come from creatures of habit. And, sometimes, habits must be broken in the name of efficiency and progress. SpaceX‚Äôs extremely fast-paced innovation makes it clear that they are great at putting this lesson into practice.

5. ‚ÄúThe product errors reflect organizational errors.‚Äù
To be a great leader, you have to understand the trickle-down effect of your organizational errors. They will flow all the way down the chain, injecting themselves right into your products and services.
That goes for any level of organization, all the way up to whole societies. Starting on page 1, Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy does a wonderful job poking fun at the absurdity of error-filled bureaucratic processes that trickle all the way down from a government body, forming persistent issues in the daily lives of its citizens.


My favourite lines from this book 


‚ÄúTime is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.‚Äù 




""For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen.‚Äù 





 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù




Verdict 

 4/5 This is one of the best Science Fiction classics out there that can make us laugh and think at the same time."
55,Jonathan Ashleigh,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Oct 13, 2014",4,"For whatever reason, when I stared reading The Time Taveler‚Äôs Wife, I was in possession of two copies. I opted to leave a copy at work and the other at home and I read at least a few pages everyday. This meant that each time I picked up the book I was slightly lost, and wondering were I was, while I searched to find my place within the pages. One copy was older and more worn than the other, with writing in the margins and creased corners. The other book was brand new and living in the present. 

Even with the time lost searching for my place, this book turned into a quick read. The premise behind it was a great idea and, while the author demanded a lot of faith from the reader, it was fun to get into the story. Even with all the questions surrounding the strange affliction attributed to the main character, I cared for the characters and worried about their destiny."
56,Becky,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Jul 23, 2013",1,"Ugh. Okay. I'm officially giving up on this one. 

So, a little disclaimer here. I do not like Orson Scott Card. As a person. I think he's a shitty human who's used his award-winning author status as a platform to advocate the denial of other humans' rights. This is detestable to me. 

But that is not why I rated this book 1 star. 

The reason I gave this book 1 star, and have given up even trying to read it, is because I do not like Orson Scott Card. As an author. This was the second book of his I've read - or tried to read- and it will most assuredly be my last. I finished the other one, but can't say I liked it, though it was... interesting. This one I just couldn't even muster up any meh over, and it's supposedly his best work. I disliked it almost immediately. 

I made it about 15%, and I've read about all I can stands, I can't stands no more. 

The writing is awful. We're told what Ender thinks. We're told what Ender feels, and does, and says, and why, and despite supposedly being in his head, I don't understand or like him at all. We're told he's a genius. We're told he's mastered calculus as a toddler, that he can hack school computers with ease. We're told that he plays game A. Then he beats it, and plays game B. In every game, the goal is conquer and kill, and he's the best at it. But we're told that Ender does that only when he's forced... but then we're told that he likes it - no he doesn't! - yes he does. He stabs the game giant in the eye and likes it, and then when the giant is 'dead' and no longer an obstacle, out of boredom, he wishes he could murder it again. Because he liked it. That's why he's The One. Duh. 

The ridiculous chapter-leading nameless dialogues are terrible and jarring and distracting, and they take me out of the story. Which is a very bad thing when I'm disliking and uninterested in the story as it is. 

The complete lack of characterization is shameful. These kids, and especially Ender, who is SIX YEARS OLD and likes to throw the N-word around like it's a frisbee, sound like adults that I wouldn't even want to talk to, let alone root for. I don't like, understand, or care about a single character in this book. Not one. Wait, I might like the Buggers, but that's only because I feel like they have to be decent if they want to rid the universe of this society of sociopaths and groomed killer children. 

Then there's the fact that I'm apparently supposed to believe that a society as advanced as this one, with space travel, in-body monitoring of thoughts and actions of their potential recruits, the ability to at least partially coax out genius children by specialized breeding, etc, would be so casually dismissive of female potential as to respond to a question regarding whether there will be girls at this murder-camp with ""A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them."" Because, apparently, only Y chromosomes can carry intelligence and females are just sub-par, even at evolution. How can they be a war leader and savior of humanity if they can't even master upward evolution, like males have? 

Oh, but wait... which entry tests were those again? The ones that require extreme violence? Stomping the shit out of another kid, albeit a bully, was the only test-like thing I saw that earned Ender a spot at murder-school. And it's OKAY that Ender put him in the hospital, because he was forced to do it or keep being bullied. There was no other solution. So maybe that little comment was a backhanded compliment to us of the gentler, weaker sex. Our delicate sensibilities just don't automatically run to murderdeathkill at the slightest provocation, which from what I can tell makes females completely valueless except as future-soldier-makers, so yeah, I guess we fail. Darn! 

I don't buy the concept of putting all of the eggs of an apparently critically endangered humanity into a single basket that consists of a child 4 years away from attaining the glorious achievement of double digit age. But wait, this war is apparently on hold while this generation of future soldiers grows up? How awesomely considerate of the ""Buggers"". I now see why they must die. /sarcasm

Which brings me to the ""Buggers"". They are aliens. Got that. Apparently, there's no possibility of aliens NOT wanting to wipe out all of humanity... because, you know, the universe isn't big enough for the both of us. I was really, really hoping for a plausible reason why these aliens would want to kill people, but I got nada. Perhaps it's explained later. Or maybe this is just fear and hatred of the unknown. I don't know, and frankly don't care all that much, but it just feels like we're supposed to just go along with the story that implies that different = bad and must be killed. 

I'm not squeamish or tender-hearted. I fully believe in killing off characters that need to die, even and especially if it's painful to the reader. Violence, in general, doesn't bother me, and I have no trouble reading about abuse, or death, or destruction, or brutality. But it needs to have a purpose and reason for existing on the page. It needs to be honest, and realistic, and plausible. And I didn't feel like that was the case here. It felt like it was for pure shock value here, placed with ever more aggressive offensiveness with the hopes of a reaction. ""OMG! they are just babies! Oh the brutality! Won't someone save the children?!"" And it worked, because my reaction is to stop reading this shit called a book. The racism, misogyny, hatred of the 'different', the adult condoned and encouraged cruelty and alienation of weaker or smaller children, the violence and genocidal-tendencies in a 6 year old all made me hate every minute I spent reading, or avoiding, this book, and only confirmed that Orson Scott Card is not someone whose work I will ever read or watch again. 

I could go on, but I'm done with this book. Writing it off and washing my hands because they feel like they've been holding something disgusting and slimy. I haven't seen anything even remotely redeeming in this book, nothing that makes me think that the rest of it would be worth my time, and I'm done."
57,Kristi,Divergent ,"Jun 05, 2010",5,"WOW. WOW.... no really, just wow. Could not put it down... and I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT! 

One of my favorites books this year, no question about it!

I've been trying to write this review for the last two hours... and nothing is coming to mind but ""AWESOME"" and ""WOW"" and ""WOW"".... did I say wow? I apologize that this review is going to be incoherent, and mostly fangirly, but that's the state of mind this book has left me in! I'm in shock of its spectacular-ness. Is that even a word?

I'll admit it, it was the cover that first drew my attention.... I read the summary and my first thought was, meh. Yes, I'll admit it, meh. Then I started hearing all the hype. When I went to a signing, in March, a few bloggers were talking about how fantastic it was. I'm always leery of hype for some reason.

Needless to say, I picked it up, and I'm SO GLAD that I did. You should pick it up too!

There are many things that make this a great book. The story, the characters the writing. It wasn't just one thing that stood out to me, this was a perfect mesh of all the things that make a book unforgettable.

When I talk about connecting with characters, this is the type of book I'm talking about. I don't mean, connection in a way of relating to them. I mean connection in a way that these characters meant something to me, that I felt their pain, their happiness, their despair. I cared what happened to them. That's what connection means to me. Divergent gave me that and so much more.

What a talented author. What an unforgettable book.

If you didn't buy it yesterday, go get it today."
58,karen,Wuthering Heights,"Dec 03, 2009",5,"""all i care about in this goddamn life are me, my drums, and you""...

if you don't know that quote, you're probably too young to be reading this and isn't it past your bedtime or shouldn't you be in school or something?

but that quote, hyper-earnest cheese - that is romance. wuthering heights is something more dangerous than romance. it's one long protracted retaliation masquerading as passion. and goddamn do i love it. i can't believe i haven't reviewed it before - i mention this book in more than half of my reviews, i have a whole shelf devoted to its retellings, so why the delay?? but better late than never. 

no, it's not a perfect novel; it's a flawed structure revealing the actions of seriously flawed people. the framing device-within-a-framing-device? totally awkward. having nelly dean tell the story even though where was she for most of the action? totally wrong move, bronte; it makes the beginning such a slog to get through. but that's just stale loaf - the good stuff is all the meat in between. 

and oh, the meat... the swarthy stranger of mysterious origins being raised in a family of sheltered overmoist english mushrooms, all pale and rain-bloated, the running wild, two-souls-against-the-world adolescence...childhood indiscretions... vows and tantrums, bonding, unspoken promises, yes i will yes i will yes i will. oh, but wait, what's this??...it's blond and it's rich and it's whats expected of me. very well then. see ya, heathcliff...

it's just textbook gothic from here on out: revenge-seduction, overheard conversations, mysterious disappearances, murdered puppies, swooning, vindictive child-rearing, death, ghosts, moors, phoar... 

but this to me, is a perfect love story, even though it's more like torture. the unattainable is always more romantic than the storybook. i don't like an uncomplicated ending, and a story is more impactful with nuanced characters, preferably heavily unlikeable throughout. (this is where i plug head-on - one of my favorite movies ever. do it.)this story just makes me feel good. and i'm well over my teenage fascination with the ""bad boy""; i realized pretty quick that ""bad boys"" are usually pretty dumb. so i moved on to ""emotionally disturbed"", which is the same thing, really; plenty of drama, and they will leave you drunken ""presents"" on your lawn (road signs, carousel ponies..), but not complete burnouts, at least. but my teenaged dating pool is neither here nor there, the point is that heathcliff can be romanticized as this victim/villain without having to correspond to the ideal. it's about the level of passion, the size of the grand romantic gesture. devoting your life to destroying the people who kept you from your true love is an amazingly grand gesture.

There's a reason us, the Fans, feel that we're connected, no matter where we from, different culture, ethics, ages..we're all graduated from there..

..Hogwarts.. even like we were in same class,classmates, no matter which edition we read..

..Cause Harry Potter is not just a story..it's a Life..

The Boy Who Saved Flourished the Book IndustryIt's One of the most important novels in modern history, Sorry, it's The Most Important ONE.
This Review also for those who hate the series !
Please bear with me..

Without it, most Book stores & publishers may have the same fate of Video Stores like Blockbuster LLC, which, despite being super popular in the 90s, closed all the stores by 2013, shutting down forever.

Yes, without this Novel, and with the rapid change in technology, the ease of making e-books and reading it in PCs, Smartphones, Tablets..etc, the publishing and trade of new paper books may decrease rapidly.
It'd be limited for religious or educating books, classics, small novels. Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol' Video Tapes.


A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel, The One.

Well, in the case you think I'm exaggerate..Let's have,

A Brief !! History of Literature in the 90s
-------------------------------
Well, let‚Äôs back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens, not to mention Video Games, Game boy and Nintendo‚Ä¶ 

Those of this new generation who read are ‚Äúweirdos"" or ""nerds‚Äù to the rest of their peers.
And for those ‚Äúfew who read‚Äù, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.


Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.
And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.

Even these new novels didn't live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie -what‚Äôs with the British authors and selling numbers :)?- , also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, in Egypt no more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..

No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.


While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites -this brand new huge technology leap back then-


No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There's few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine‚Äôs Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.


And in Egypt there‚Äôs also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made ‚ÄúPocket Novels‚Äù for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.


There‚Äôs also ‚ÄúReading for All‚Äù, project by the first lady ‚ÄúSusan Mubarak‚Äù, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.


But all these effort didn't attract ‚Äúmore and more‚Äù of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.
The vast numbers of those who don‚Äôt just read will increase if there isn't a BIG new attractive Reading Experience to get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.
But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in 1994, and became a real phenomenon by 1995..

..it‚Äôs Playstation, The giant Japanese Gaming leap..
Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman‚Äôs comics when you can play them..

~~~~~~ A beat. ~~~~~~

So by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.

So do you think it‚Äôs wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?

Of course not, it may not even cover it‚Äôs publishing cost.

So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, when Joanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...

A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel, that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it, and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it‚Äôs 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.

But then, the Modest ‚ÄúBloomsbury‚Äú agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she‚Äôd get a day job, since it‚Äôs a little chance of making money in children's books. - later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-
But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..
So with her name & her grandmother‚Äôs ""Kathleen"" come the 2 initial of her pen name..

J . k . Rowling

And in 26 June 1997 , with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries, come out in UK, to our World The Greatest..



Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

And Bam!! , everything happened so fast..
Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK.

An American important publisher, Scholastic, won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.
Just with small change, 'Philosopher's Stone' to be 'Sorcerer's Stone', as the American publisher feared 'Philosopher's' may not be that attractive to young readers..
And Thanks to Harry Potter, now Every young readers worldwide know much more about Philosopher's Stone's legend.

In 1998 Book Two released in UK , 1999 in US, winning more literary prizes. And becoming NO.1 Top Selling Book in UK , US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book.


And on 8 July 1999, The 
First Breaking Record
 made when Book Three sold 68.000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.. and more copies when it released late 1999 in US..

With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers, more records had been broken..

The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks & months, and it's even still in hardcover editions.
This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines & newspapers separate the 'Harry Potter books' selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting the lists into 'Children Books' and 'Adult Books' sections, under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking.

And then it was year 2000 , where everything is about to change ... forever..

The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games..

But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of 8 July 2000 in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not in front of Cinemas as usual, not electronic stores as Apple stores as happening theses days, But it was in front of Bookstores, for The First time in the Book Stores History, to buy a copy of...

 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
And They didn't mind to find out that the book is over 700 page, it was even for their pleasure, more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels.. double the thriller, double the fun..

Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US , a New World Record, totally unexpected one.
Huge story, bigger plot , mysterious and very well written.

And more literate prizes for Rowling... more translated editions to more than 40 language. 

And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director...and it also made some Cinematic Records back then, but that's not our subject now. 


~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

With the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid. 2003 , and with 2 movies out so far, The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on..

So, As more readers from this generation start to increase , Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more..
Older Fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings -which was a super successful movie by then too- Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions. And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers.


More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon.. The English edition AND the local translated ones , both been sold everywhere worldwide.


Even in Egypt English edition sold at many books stores. And, hopefully, some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo & Alexandria by 2002-2003..

And in summer 2002, after the Movie wild success, Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition.
Although it cut some of the lines for length issues, the edition still hold the magic of it ..making a very good sales.


~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

The good news is, the literary movement didn't stop there, Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics. No , there's more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers..

By 2002 ,Life of Pi, Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers.

And in April 2003 Dan Brown (previously published 3 novels, making good sales) released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records, The Da Vinci Code..
The funny thing that there's a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is 'the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible', a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that.

A month later, May 2003, Khaled Hosseini released his first novel, The Kate Runner  which also made a very good records too. -Don't you agree if there's no Harry Potter before, this Afghan-born author would have a chance? He'd be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who :)- 

And all that didn't affect the main reason for this new 'Literal Renaissance'.
All that didn't affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later..

On 20 June 2003 book Five 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' comes out..

Ten thousands of all ages conquer the Book Stores in UK, US and other countries too at the same day to get The One Book they've been waiting for at least 2 years. Shipping agents like FedEx made the delivery to many countries to get the book at the same time.

A New world Record ,5 millions copy at the first day only..
For the first time in France a non french language book placed in no.1 of the bestselling book....

Some kids got a headache called 'Harry Potter Headache' as they read the whole 850 pages of the book five, the biggest so far, at the same day without resting.

And in Egypt, September the same year, the Arabic edition of book three comes out with unexpected sales records, first edition run out of the stores by the first week only, though it's nearly the beginning of the School year, and the movie of this 3rd book still filming. 
ŸêAnd the price of it get higher 20% in 2 days and still with increasing demand..

More English books and novels sold in Egypt too, along with the Arabic ones, publishing more books for new Egyptian authors and writers along with more of the famous ones, Alaa El Aswany's debut Novel 'Yaqubean's Building' making a very good selling numbers..



And in  July 2004 the Arabic edition of Book Four makes a price war between book stores and magazines stands.
January 2005 , an abridged translated edition of Book Five make many readers angry in Egypt , specially that many already read the English edition before, so the publisher release an unabridged one by May.

~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

And on 21 July 2005, A Higher Record that breaks all the previously ones



 6.9 million copy of Book Six sold in US in its first day only...
A huge book, it may not be as the fans' expectations of being full of action , but it get a twist that blow minds about one of the most interesting characters, Professor Snape. That made many fans and even big authors like Stephen King and Salman Rushdie talk about for months..

With Pre-Final Book of Harry Potter is out, it followed by a massive variety of New Novels, New Series, New Authors..
Twilight series, Percy Jackson series, and much more, more Books Sales not only in US, UK but worldwide..
More Novels hit the top sales..
A Real Prosperity.

But still Harry Potter is the Records Big Breaker...

At the midnight before 21 June 2007, Everywhere around the Globe, the scene of thousands of people lining in front of Book Stores was repeated...even Bigger than any time before..

A Huge Record for Pre-Orders online reach to One Million copies by Amazon only, and total sales of 11 millions copies in UK and US in the first day only.

The book sold at the Same Day almost in Every Single Country..


even in Israel which made a big religious fuss because the Book Stores opened to receive and sell the book at the releasing day which was their holy Saturday, But it's Harry Potter after all, the world's most unusual, unexpected phenomenon and sales records breaker.

And that's not bad, it was the Miracle of bringing back readers to Book Stores...

And it's not just Harry Potter...
Now, that 
'All was well.'
 , thousands of topics went online asking 'what to read next'....
Indeed, although there's the e-books, e-readers..etc, still there's thousands of new books and novels published and sold every year , in every where in the world.

The gaming devices is increasing? yes, But not as expected though by the 90s and early 2000s 'remember Nokia N-Gage?'.. but so does the reading devices which first come out by Sony in 2004,make big step by Amazon's Kindle in 2007...the ebook applications on every device.


New books and series come after that, and still on, making super sales, attracting more readers... more writers come with more books and novels, some are just a rip off others and some are really original and brilliant. in UK, US , Egypt ..everywhere all over the globe..

No matter a Playstation 4 is out, or new Xbox, the Books still there...with its most beloved magic..
 
The magic of books is back and , I believe, to stay..

Don't you see with me that the magic of Harry Potter is one of the main factors of this magic?


‚ÄúThis boy will be famous. There won‚Äôt be a child in our world who doesn‚Äôt know his name‚Äù


That's what Rowling wrote at the very early pages of her first book.. The one that rejected by 12 Publishing Houses in 1996..

Well, what about now?

God, Talked too much in the ""Brief"" introduction , didn't I?

Well, that's it for this review... I guess some still think it's just the Propaganda that made that all....
Well I'll try to prove them wrong by the upcoming next 6 reviews at the other 6 Books of the series..
Links will be here as soon as it'd done ..

But for The First one... sorry to add one more , but 20000 characters aren't enough.

60,Lynda,Charlotte's Web,"Jan 03, 2014",4,
61,Adina,Wuthering Heights,"Oct 28, 2016",2,"There are some books that you either love of hate; there is not much middle ground. Like some types of food. Marmite or licorice come to mind. Wuthering Heights is one of those books. Since I started using GR I have read many conflicting reviews for this book and they made me increasingly curios to find out which side I would take. Unfortunately, I am more with the hate party. 

I will not write a long review here as it was done thousands of times. I will only say that the book took all the joy of living from me and put me into a reading slump from which I hope to heal quickly. After I finished this last night I was considering what to read next and I realized I did not want to read anything for a while, I felt catatonic.

I believe I started the book on a wrong foot. I was expecting a love story, which in my opinion it is not. Instead, I think this is a very well done study of two sociopaths, pathologically obsessed with each other who manage to destroy the life of everyone they know for the fun of it. Their ability to hurt others and each other is so extraordinary that I might consider this book from the paranormal genre. 

Yes, I appreciate that the novel is revolutionary for the period and so on but I did not enjoy it at all. Dear friends that love this novel, I am really sorry I did not like it more and I hope you will not take it personally. 

Disclaimer: I read it in Romanian, the way I prefer to read all Victorian novels in order to avoid the archaic language. Maybe I was lost in translation."
62,Gina,The Great Gatsby,"Oct 23, 2007",4,"Over drinks, I‚Äôve observed‚Äîlike so many smart alecks‚Äîthat much of The Great Gatsby‚Äôs popularity relies heavily on its shortness. At a sparse 180 pages, Fitzgerald‚Äôs masterpiece could be argued to be the ‚ÄúGreat American novella.‚Äù Gatsby, like so many other short classics, is easily readable, re-readable, and assessable to everyone from the attention-deficient young to mothers juggling a kid, a career, and a long-held desire to catch up on all those books ‚Äúthey should have read but haven‚Äôt gotten around to yet‚Äù.

I‚Äôve now read Gatsby three times, and I admit that on my first reading during (like handfuls of others) my senior year English class, I wasn‚Äôt particularly fond of the book; I believe I used the adjective ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù on numerous occasions. Daisy Buchanan seemed like a twit of a woman, and I found Jay Gatsby to be pathetically clawing in his attempt to attain her. Nick, my guide, only annoyed me further with his apparent hero-worshiping of a man I found one-dimensional and his adoration for the kind of woman I‚Äôve seen other men purport to be goddesses, but in fact, are dim-witted simpletons with nice figures. 

Over my two subsequent readings‚Äîpushed along by friends whose judgment I trusted and who swore the book was ‚Äúso funny and ironic‚Äù‚ÄîI discovered within Fitzgerald‚Äôs fable a sardonic social wit and a heavily layered critique of the American Dream: the poor, working (wo)man rising above his or her social situation to discover money conquers all. 

Fitzgerald has a discerning ability for sharp critiques of the economically privileged and, like Jane Austin, has an ear for realistic, bantering dialogue. Through Nick‚Äôs narration, we see a world that so many Americans dream of (its enviableness only further accentuated by our open disdain for it): a life of endless parties, delicious food, beautiful clothes, and Paris Hilton. Nick who‚Äôs paradoxically drawn to his cousin, Daisy‚Äôs, and her husband, Tom‚Äôs, lifestyle with gloating contempt echoes the contemporary American idolization of an elite lifestyle that none but a select few attain. 

We watch Daisy with her voice that ‚Äúsounds of money‚Äù flit about with uncompromising shallowness and vivacious school-girl frivolity, and through her, see so many of the inconsequential remarks and actions others (as well as ourselves) have made for the sheer sake of ‚Äúhaving a good time‚Äù. In spite of her frivolity and weak disposition, we become, like Gatsby, ‚Äúoverwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.‚Äù

Through Gatsby‚Äôs veneration of Daisy, we not only imagine what so many Americans desire (success), but also we see the goal and glittering fixation of all humanity: beauty. And like many Americans in the throes of Capitalism, Gatsby believes that money can buy beauty as well as love. Fitzgerald articulates this disillusion with haunting force, particularly voiced through Nick‚Äôs obsessive repulsion with the extravagant society his social status has allowed him and the sadness he finds while watching a ‚Äúworking man‚Äù attempt to enter it. 

One critique of The Great Gatsby, which could also be argued as a positive, is the limited scope of action and themes Fitzgerald chooses to encapsulate. We only see the wealthy elite (or people wanting to be the wealthy elite), and only Nick really has any depth of characterization. Unlike a tome, such as War and Peace, Gatsby fails to have numerous interwoven plotlines within a grand historical context. Yes, the Jazz Age is the novel‚Äôs backdrop, but Fitzgerald fails to engage in any discussion beyond a summer among the wealthy youth partying into the wee hours of the night in the West Egg. Yet, the control with which Fitzgerald expresses his limited themes makes the novel‚Äôs lack of scope forgivable.

Gatsby is short and easily accessible, and I have no doubt these aspects of the novel do lend to its everlasting popularity. At the same time, it should never diminish its truly admirable ability to tease apart some of the most confounding qualities American culture values: money, beauty, youth, hard work, and the ever effusive, love."
63,Bentley ‚òÖ Bookbastion.net,The Lightning Thief ,"Mar 19, 2017",5,"My inner child is absolutely devastated that I didn't read this series when I was a kid. Percy Jackson was one of those series that was always there, just on the periphery of my social conscious. I knew I should read it, but for one reason or another I gravitated to other things instead. 


Thankfully, as an adult who likes reviewing books for fun in my spare time, I have absolutely no shame about reading the series now, even if it was originally intended for a younger audience. In some ways, I think I might have even enjoyed it more as an adult. 

I'm a huge fan of Greek mythology. (I may or may not have filled electives in high school and college with classes on mythology; just like I may or may not have obsessed over shows like Xena and Hercules in my teenage years.) I had a great time comparing my own personal knowledge of Greek mythology against the ways that Riordan weaves the stories into Percy's larger adventure.

It's such a fun way to introduce Greek mythology to children and teens while staying entertaining for adults as well! The mythology remains faithful to the original stories, but it feels fresh and fun here as each character is full of personality and charm. The world is full of magic and wonder and I never once felt bored as the characters explored within it. 

Speaking of characters full of personality, Percy Jackson himself is one of my new faves in terms of characterization. He's brave, loyal and hilarious and his friendship with Grover and Annabeth has quickly become a favorite for me. Also, can I just say that I think it's so cute that Riordan based Percy on his son, who had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia? I think it's so awesome that Percy gets to sort of stand apart from other heroes in stories as a champion for those kids forevermore. 

When I finished reading this book, I immediately went and told my 11 year old nephew that he absolutely had to read this book so I had someone to talk to about it. I'm proud to call myself a Percy Jackson fan and will be continuing the rest of the series shortly! 

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ = 5 stars!

65,Thomas,The Help,"Apr 17, 2010",2,"1.24.2020 update:

Whew I originally read this book when I was in high school and wow did I lack racial awareness then. I left my original five-star review below, though now I recognize that there are a lot of problems with a white woman portraying the south in this way. Here's a link to an article that explains this with a good amount of depth, featuring the perspective of Viola Davis: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/201...

Here's a concise Goodreads review I'd recommend checking out: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...

Original review:

Originally, I thought this book should have been retitled The Hype. At least that's what I told my friend. I remember thinking something along the lines of, blah, another story about racism in the old southern days? Must be the chick-lit version of To Kill a Mockingbird. Wow. I was so wrong.

The Help details the lives of three women living in Jackson, Mississippi, right when the Civil Rights Movement began. There is Skeeter, a twenty-two-year-old aspiring writer who terribly misses her maid, Constantine. Aibileen is an experienced and knowledgeable black maid who is currently taking care of her seventeenth child, Mae Mobley, even though she realizes what's at stake for both of them. And Minny is a fierce, sassy cook who doesn't take nonsense from anyone, even when it risks her employment. This tumultuous trio takes the first step in sparking a movement that will ignite fire to the racism and hypocrisy of their small town.

My synopsis of the story probably isn't even a tenth of the merit it deserves. I don't want to spoil too much about the book, but the most amazing thing about The Help is its characters. They are so real, so lifelike, I could feel their thoughts pulsing through my head and their emotions racing through my veins. I was angry alongside them, cheered for them, and cried with them.

I think everyone should read this book, especially people who are ignorant about the racism and hypocrisy that still manages to plight everyday society. The Help wasn't just a darn good read, but something that has made me reevaluate and examine my own morals. I'll never forget it.

66,J.G. Keely,The Catcher in the Rye,"May 26, 2007",2,"Sometimes truth isn't just stranger than fiction, it's also more interesting and better plotted. Salinger helped to pioneer a genre where fiction was deliberately less remarkable than reality. His protagonist says little, does little, and thinks little, and yet Salinger doesn't string Holden up as a satire of deluded self-obsessives, he is rather the epic archetype of the boring, yet self-important depressive.

I've taken the subway and had prolonged conversations on the street with prostitutes (not concerning business matters), and I can attest that Salinger's depiction is often accurate to what it feels like to go through an average, unremarkable day. However, reading about an average day is no more interesting than living one.

Beyond that, Salinger doesn't have the imagination to paint people as strangely as they really are. Chekhov's 'normal' little people seem more real and alive than Salinger's because Chekhov injects a little oddness, a little madness into each one. Real people are almost never quite as boring as modernist depictions, because everyone has at least some ability to surprise you.

Salinger's world is desaturated. Emotions and moments seep into one another, indistinct as the memories of a drunken party. Little importance is granted to events or thoughts, but simply pass by, each duly tallied by an author in the role of court reporter.

What is interesting about this book is not that it is realistically bland, but that it is artificially bland. Yet, as ridiculous a concept as that is, it still takes itself entirely in earnest, never acknowledging the humor of its own blase hyperbole.

This allows the book to draw legions of fans from all of the ridiculously dull people who take themselves as seriously as Holden takes himself. They read it not as a parody of bland egotism but a celebration, poised to inspire all the bland egotists who have resulted from the New Egalitarianism in Art, Poetry, Music, and Academia.

Those same folks who treat rationality and intellectual fervor like a fashion to be followed, imagining that the only thing required to be brilliant is to mimic the appearance and mannerisms of the brilliant; as if black berets were the cause of poetic inspiration and not merely a symptom.

One benefit of this is that one can generally sniff out pompous faux intellectuals by the sign that they hold up Holden as a sort of messianic figure. Anyone who marks out Holden as a role-model is either a deluded teen with an inflated sense of entitlement, or is trying to relive the days when they were.

But what is more interesting is that those who idolize Holden tend to be those who most misunderstand him. Upon close inspection, he's not depressive, not consumed with ennui or an existential crisis, he's actually suffering from 'Shell Shock'--now known as 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'.

The way he thinks about his brother's and classmate's deaths--going over the details again and again in his mind, but with no emotional connection--it's not symptomatic of depression, but of psychological trauma. He is stuck in a cycle, unable to process events, going over them again and again, but never able to return to normalcy.

It takes a certain kind of self-centered prick to look at someone's inability to cope with the reality of death and think ""Hey, that's just like my mild depression over how my parents won't buy me a newer ipod!"" It's not an unusual stance in American literature--there's an arrogant detachment in American thought which has become less and less pertinent as the world grows and changes. As recently as The Road we have American authors comparing a difficult father-son relationship to the pain and turmoil of an African civil war survivor--and winning awards for displaying their insensitive arrogance.

Perhaps it's time we woke up and realized that the well-fed despondence of the white man should not be equated with a lifetime of death, starvation, war, and traumas both physical and emotional. And as for Salinger--a real sufferer of Post-Traumatic Stress who was one of the first soldiers to see a concentration camp, who described how you can never forget the smell of burning flesh--I can only imagine how he felt when people read his story of a man, crippled by the thought of death, and thought to themselves ""Yes, that's just what it's like to be a trustafarian with uncool parents"". No wonder he became a recluse and stopped publishing."
67,whalesister,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Mar 28, 2008",5,"I read the entire series, one right after another, eight times in a row when I got them for Christmas in fourth grade. Obviously I loved them then. Just finished reading them again to Eric, my 8-year-old, and loved them maybe just as must as I did as a 10-year-old. Eric couldn't stop giggling through the last pages of Horse and His Boy, which we had to reread when we finished the rest, since it was his favorite. We're starting Prince Caspian again, too--another favorite. I realized this go around how much these books shaped my entire world view, and especially my perspective on religion, though I never knew it as a kid. 

One odd little detail that I noticed this time reading Voyage of the Dawn Treader: awful cousin Eustace and his parents are Mormons. Lewis never comes right out and says it, but in addition to being snooty holier-than-thous that nobody can stand, the parents don't drink, don't smoke, and wear a funny kind of underwear. A nice little under-handed slam at a faith that loves to quote him in General Conference. 

I'll still keep quoting. I love his writing."
68,Jim Fonseca,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Nov 11, 2011",5,"Even if we haven‚Äôt read the book everyone knows the plot. A painter paints a portrait of a beautiful young man. The portrait ages while he keeps his beauty. But the portrait also reflects his evil, not just aging, but turning eventually into a portrait of a devil. 

There are thousands of reviews so I‚Äôll just copy the next paragraph from the GR book blurb: 

Written in his distinctively dazzling manner, Oscar Wilde‚Äôs story of a fashionable young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty is the author‚Äôs most popular work. The tale of Dorian Gray‚Äôs moral disintegration caused a scandal when it Ô¨Årst appeared in 1890, but though Wilde was attacked for the novel‚Äôs corrupting inÔ¨Çuence, he responded that there is, in fact, ‚Äúa terrible moral in Dorian Gray.‚Äù




The various nuggets of philosophy and thoughts and acerbic wit that the author intersperses throughout are a pleasure to read. Just a few examples:

 On a painter‚Äôs reputation ‚Äú‚Ä¶as soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúThe ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.‚Äù

 About a hostess introducing her guests: ‚ÄúShe either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI make a great difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects.‚Äù 

 ‚ÄúWords! Mirror words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel!‚Ä¶ Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?‚Äù



‚ÄúNothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.‚Äù 

 [She] is so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.‚Äù

 [of an uncommunicative old man] ‚Äú‚Ä¶he had said everything that he had to say before he was 30.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúHe was always late on principle, his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúMen marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned people and did not realize that we lived in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities‚Ä¶‚Äù

Here are three vicious descriptions just going around a single dinner table:

A woman with ‚Äú‚Ä¶the remains of a really remarkable ugliness.‚Äù

A man who is ‚Äú‚Ä¶one of those middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies, but are thoroughly disliked by their friends‚Ä¶‚Äù

A man who ‚Äú‚Ä¶like so many of his class, was under the impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of ideas.‚Äù




In his short life (1854-1900) Wilde was part of the movement called aestheticism ‚Äì ‚Äúart for art‚Äôs sake,‚Äù not for its deeper meanings. Wilde‚Äôs brief preface give us his ‚Äòmanifesto,‚Äô bits of which are: 

‚ÄúTo reveal art and conceal the artist is art‚Äôs aim‚Ä¶Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated‚Ä¶There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all‚Ä¶All art is at once surface and symbol‚Ä¶It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors‚Ä¶All art is quite useless.‚Äù

I should also say that the edition I read, 2018 by Read Books Ltd., had two errors in dates on the cover blurb. Does it matter? Not really, but it makes you wonder what else is sloppy inside the text.

69,Lisa of Troy,Animal Farm,"Jan 28, 2022",5,"Animal Farm is the story of a set of animals who overthrow their human-owner. Will the animals have better lives now that the humans are gone?

Philip Pullman once said that, ""A story will help us make sense of anything."" In this case, George Orwell uses Animal Farm as an allegory of Russian history with certain characters representing famous Russian historical figures such as Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Leon Trotsky. 

This book was part of the monthly Readalongs that I am hosting, and what a wonderous book to begin 2022! The Readalong was simply spectacular and gave this reading such a particular depth. As the Readalong encompassed readers across the globe, we had the opportunity to discuss how the book related to our own government's history. Animal Farm provides a lot of ideas to noodle on, and I really enjoyed it.

Content and Trigger Warnings: bullying, loss of a parent, minor blood depiction, talk of abuse, and arachnophobia."
71,MacK,Pride and Prejudice,"Aug 12, 2007",5,"Where my massive crush on Jane Austen began: alone, on a hot day in Montana, cursing her name.

I had to read it for AP English and I could not see the point. Girls need to marry. Girls can't get married. Girls are sad. Girls get married. Girls are happy.

I went to school to half heartedly discuss it and waffled and wavered in an effort to please my teacher. Finally she said: ""was it good or not, Ben?"" 

""No it wasn't.""

""Thank you...now read this twenty pages of literary criticism for homework.""

Twenty pages of literary criticism later, I was hooked. Once you know what to look for, it's hilarious. Once you're keyed into the contextual life of women, you have to feel for the plight of the Bennet sisters, and laugh at the crudity of their mother and Mr. Collins.

So yes: I'm a guy and I love Jane Austen. You got a problem with that? Huh? Huh? Do you? Huh??? Well if you do, I'll be over here nursing my dorkiness just waiting for a fight for the honor of my beloved Jane."
72,Tharindu Dissanayake,The Lightning Thief ,"Jan 20, 2021",4,"""You need to study war, punk.""

Given how well received this book is (and the entire series), I was looking forward to continue my fantasy to-read list with Percy Jackson and the Olympians for a while now. I know it's children's book, but when has that ever stopped me.. But still, one cannot help but be somewhat anxious while starting a new series, for things could go either way. And when things turn out better than expected - like it did with Lightening Thief - life is beautiful. This is a wonderful little story, and hopefully the first of many, of an interesting series.

""Remarkable, really, the lengths to which humans will go to fit things into their version of reality.""

Being a children's story, it's understandable that character building plays the bigger role compared to setting up the environment. Still, I think the environs were adequately defined. The main characters - including the first person protagonist - were interesting, fun and delightful to observe. However, for me, the secondary characters appeared a little too funny, even when they were supposed to be threatening. It took away some of the suspense/ thrill that could've been there in my opinion. And also, if the set of main characters were a little older, may be things would appear a little more realistic (relatively). But as the plot itself is great, it's easy to forget those shortcomings, and enjoy the story. Obviously, none of these would matter to kids at all, who will find the entire thing to be quite entertaining. Sequence of events is very well thought out, and laid out in a way that will make you want to read the entire thing in one go, which is not difficult to do actually, as the book is not very long. Everything is well written, and well capable of intriguing one to continue with the rest of the series (which I'll be doing shortly).

""The truth is not always clear until events come to pass."""
73,Jonathan Terrington,Dracula,"Sep 15, 2011",5,"Dracula: the very name instantly brings to mind visions of vampires, stakes, garlic, and crucifixes. Yet, when one bothers to read the novel, it becomes self-evident how twisted modern vampire fiction now is.

Vampires are not meant to inhabit the roles of heroes. Go back a few hundred years and men believed truly that the vampire was a real immortal, cursed to quench his undying thirst with a living mortal‚Äôs blood. The very idea of a blood drinker should, therefore, inspire the image of a villain within the mind. And that is what the titular character of this novel is.

The word novel is not used lightly, as one could also write that this is a collaboration of journals, letters and papers. For that is how Bram Stoker chose to fashion his famous novel (in epistolary form). While the different viewpoints through each journal serve to create suspense which suits the gothic tone of the novel perfectly.

In all, it is a macabre novel that serves to make the reader reflect upon good and evil. The vampire, to me, is nothing more than an indication of man‚Äôs cursed nature. Who, unless he is delivered, must suck the life from others around him. Ultimately only the righteous can destroy the darkness that serves to drain life. That is the lesson which Bram Stoker's timeless classic unswervingly conveys."

To be honest,I never thought I would read this,not because it is something I don't like(it is something I most like),but it is so huge.But now I thank the gods and the kings for making me read this.I can't explain how much I admire this book.It has been a part of my geeky life and I am proud for that.I am a fan,an ultimate true fan!

 

These are some things you get from reading this book:

Smart talks and tactics

everything else was perfect:)

 

Okay so now I'll talk about the perfection of them all Daenerys Targaryen.She is not only my favorite character of all,but after I started watching the show,and she had a face,and boy what a face,I am truly deeply in love(and I got to see her naked).God bless the show.Daenerys is the mother of dragons and you will know what I am talking about in the end of the book,which for me was one of the best endings I have ever read.

 

This world is so complex and there are so many characters,yet it is so thrilling and fun to read.And I love the idea of not having safe characters.In every page you turn,your favorite character can die.

 

I highly recommend this book,this is clearly one of the best works I have read of the last century.And this goes to Mr.Martin

76,‚ùÄ Lily ‚ùÄ,The Outsiders,"May 03, 2020",5,"This reread was just as good as the first time around!

77,Hannah Azerang,The Hunger Games ,"Dec 22, 2014",5,rereading this for the first time in 10 years and it feels more relevant than ever. truly a timeless classic.
78,Melanie,City of Bones ,"Apr 23, 2018",3,"‚ÄúWhere there is love, there is often also hate. They can exist side by side.‚Äù


Hi, my name is Melanie, and I‚Äôm the last person on this planet to read anything by Cassie Clare! But I had too many best friends who promised me that reading this series would be worth it for me to finally get to Lady Midnight! Well, the other night I did an Instagram poll, because I wanted something fae and I was just going to pick up Lady Midnight, without reading any of Cassie‚Äôs other work, and some of my friends lost their shit, to put it lightly. And this is the story of how I got roped into finally reading City of Bones in 2018.

Again, I‚Äôm the last person to read this, but City of Bones starts off with a young girl named Clary, and her and her friend, Simon, are in line for a teen club. Yeah, the two-thousand vibes were real. Once inside the club, a couple individuals catch her eye and she can‚Äôt resist following them out of the club, to only realize that she isn‚Äôt supposed to be able to see them in the first place. 

We are then thrown into the paranormal world that is hidden from the mundanes (non-magical humans). We see vampires, werewolves, fae *swoons forever*, angels, demons, and everything else you think of when you think paranormal. And we also are introduced to the world of shadowhunters, the warriors who are sworn to defeat the demons. 

And Clary‚Äôs world gets turned upside down when she realizes that her mother has been doing everything in her power to keep her hidden from this paranormal world. And Clary can‚Äôt even ask her for the truth, because her mother has gone missing. And the only people who can help her are the shadowhunters. *dun dun dun*



‚ÄúKeep in mind that when your mother fled from the Shadow World, it wasn‚Äôt the monsters she was hiding from. Not the warlocks, the wolf-men, the Fair Folk, not even the demons themselves. It was them. It was the Shadowhunters.‚Äù


Back when this series came out, everyone was saying it was ‚ÄúHarry Potter fanfic‚Äù and my pretentious, Harry Potter obsessed self wasn‚Äôt going to read anything that was a rip off of my fandom. And were a few of the similarities there? Yeah, I mean, this is a story that centers around three brothers with three magical items that a certain villain wants, who has been presumed dead for a while now. The parallels (and names, I guess) between Valentine and Voldemort are very apparent, especially their desire for wanting magic blood to be pure. But besides this big aspect, I really couldn‚Äôt easily see any other Harry Potter elements.

But you know what else? City of Bones holds up decently well in 2018. I was a little thrown off that it is told in third person, but I actually think it has aged pretty well. I am always so desperately scared to go back and read my high school favorites, because I doubt they will hold up and have the same magic they did back in the mid two-thousands. This this was a good read, and it was funny, and touched on a lot of things that are super relevant and ‚Äúcool‚Äù today. 

And I was honestly impressed that Cassandra Clare wasn‚Äôt scared to write in LGBTQIAP+ characters in 2007. I was surprised that we got confirmation for two characters, without it ever feeling manipulative or even drawn out. And she even touches on homophobia and how differently a character would be treated if their colleagues knew he was gay. I mean, this is pretty impressive for 2007, and it wasn‚Äôt lost on me. I will say the end there was a villain that maybe did the things he did because of his love for another man that I wish wasn‚Äôt in the book, but it didn‚Äôt erase the good Cassie did with the other two characters. 



‚ÄúThe meek may inherit the earth, but at the moment it belongs to the conceited. Like me.‚Äù


This book also surprisingly made me laugh. Jace is like the most sarcastic character ever, and he actually had me laughing in so many scenes. And I loved seeing the mystery unfold right alongside Clary. Magnus was everything, I wanted so much more of him instantly. But I ended up thinking that Luke and his backstory stole the spotlight. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for those feelings. And this book had a huge cast of characters, so I‚Äôm very curious about how I‚Äôll feel about all of them as the series progresses. 

Quick sentence about how the characters made me feel: 
‚ûΩ 
Clary
 - super likeable.
‚ûΩ 
Jace
 - half love and half hate (and still side eyeing you all, maybe). 
‚ûΩ 
Simon
 - so annoying, please, no one give this boy a certain cup.
‚ûΩ 
Isabelle
 - marry me this instant.
‚ûΩ 
Alec
 - I feel neutral but hope to end up liking more.
‚ûΩ 
Magnus
 - going to be the best character in literature. 
‚ûΩ 
Luke
 - the star of this book for me. 
‚ûΩ 
Hodge
 - super good surprise. 
‚ûΩ 
Valentine
 - needs to get bent. 



‚ÄúYou want to know what it‚Äôs like when your parents are good churchgoing folk and you happen to be born with the devil‚Äôs mark?‚Äù


Overall, I went into this with the lowest of expectations. Like, picture the lowest expectations that a human can have. Okay, now, mine were lower than even that. So maybe that‚Äôs why I got so much enjoyment out of this story. But I honestly did have a lot of fun with this, and it made me very curious to pick up the next book (hopefully soon)! Also, I have been very blessed to not be spoiled for anything in this series, the only thing I always hear was, ‚ÄúCLARY AND JACE!‚Äù Which is why I‚Äôm side-eyeing each one of you if the ending of this book is true. Like, you all nasty.

[Reread: March, 2019]
Oh my word, the appreciation I have for all the threads that Cassie Clare started weaving in this first book that truly started it all. Seeing these kids, not even beginning to understand what is ahead for them. My heart. I loved this way more the second time around, and I especially loved rereading this with Lea! ‚ù§"
79,N,Twilight ,"Jun 07, 2007",1,"I really enjoy lively details. There's nothing better than knowing an author has really thought about her characters and situations, and come up with some surprising and delightful detail that makes the whole reading experience fuller. Lively details, you understand -- pointless details are a nightmare to read. I don't need to know that Bella ate a granola bar for breakfast. I REALLY DON'T. (Notice that I remembered the granola bar. I think this is partly because I was fervently hoping it would have significance. Like, she would spectacularly choke on her oatmeal the next day and think, ""AH, I should have had a granola bar like yesterday!"")

""Show, don't tell"" is not the be-all-and-end-all of writing. There's a little thing called summary narrative. It's beautiful; it facilitates plot progression without having to follow your narrator through 24-fucking-hours of a day... and ""watch"" as she eats a fucking granola bar for breakfast.

I've seen this novel accused of Mary Sue-ism and um, yeah, any character named Isabella Swan seems destined to be a Mary Sue. But honestly, I wouldn't begrudge a semi-autobiographical story if it actually had any of the realism of autobiography. All the high school/teenage stuff honestly made me boggle. Because... that's not what high school is like! That's not what being seventeen is like! Twilight reads like... well, it reads like a thirtysomething who has no recollection of being 17. Bella has all the emotional maturity of a 32-year-old and that's just not remotely believable. 

Meyer is not a bad writer. She has the ability to string words together. Unfortunately, she lacks any kind of flair. There was no original description; no truly evocative language. Twilight reads like Meyer has read a lot of mediocre novels and regurgitated the same kind of language onto the page. There is just nothing exciting to the language. The dialogue is awful: not only uninspiring and lacking in wit, but... it's all the same! There's no difference in speech patterns to the characters; no awareness of personal tics. The characterization is wafer-thin (see above, re: Mary Sue). The plotting is terrible: the novel trundles along at a slow pace for 250 pages and then Meyer seems to suddenly realize she needs a climax and the gears shift abruptly and the reader is caught up in a series of ridiculous contrivances that set up Meyer's final set-piece (which, by the way, I saw coming a mile away).

This is such a profoundly antifeminist novel. And it's funny, because I think Meyer has no idea that it's antifeminist. I mean, she has a female heroine! A heroine who reads Austen and writes essays about misogyny in Shakespeare! Surely she's kicking butt for all womankind. Um... no. She cooks, she cleans, she looks after the man in her life! She needs male characters to protect her from the big, bad, scary world! She falls headfirst into a disturbingly dysfunctional relationship with a man 90 years her senior without the slightest amount of worry!

Seriously. Bella/Edward. What's that all about? I don't get the attraction. He has her in his thrall. She is, let me quote, ""unconditionally and irrevocably"" in love with him -- and after, like, a week. o__O She's consumed by him; she's willing to sacrifice her life for him, and that's... romantic? I just think it's a bit sick, really. You know what I find romantic? Human warmth. Not sweeping, dramatic statements of everlasting and overarching love. Little, sweet moments of connection that ring true. That's something Twilight's apparently epic love story is sorely lacking in. (Did I say Bella has the emotional maturity of a 32-year-old? Well, except when it comes to Edward. There she has the emotional maturity of a dumb dog.)"
80,Guille,Dr√°cula,"May 12, 2020",2,"Los libros rara vez me provocan carcajadas y nunca miedo, alg√∫n desasosiego quiz√°s, pero miedo nunca, por lo que no me ha extra√±ado que este tampoco me lo produjera. Por el contrario, s√≠ me han sorprendido las pinceladas de humor que aparecen de vez en cuando (‚Äúlas mujeres parec√≠an guapas, si no te aproximabas a ellas‚Äù) o la descripci√≥n que hace del conde y que contrasta tanto con la iconograf√≠a cinematogr√°fica. La verdad es que soy incapaz de imaginarme a Dr√°cula con bigote y con manos anchas y dedos regordetes. Tambi√©n me ha llamado la atenci√≥n, aunque no me ha sorprendido dado el sexo del autor y la √©poca, la ilimitada admiraci√≥n que las se√±oritas sienten por el g√©nero masculino y, en comparaci√≥n, la poca estima que demuestran por el propio. 

En conjunto, pese a la metedura de pata con temas como las transfusiones, demostrando as√≠ el gran desprecio por la ciencia que el autor sent√≠a, o algunos hechos de la trama no bien justificados, o ese final que pareciera como si el autor, por la noche, con ganas ya de irse ya a dormir, la rematara deprisa y corriendo, me ha entretenido, sin m√°s. 

Est√° claro que la novela tiene la gran virtud de haber creado el mito de Dr√°cula, lo que no est√° al alcance de cualquiera. Y sin embargo, el personaje fue manifiestamente mejorado con posterioridad. 

Por cierto, Luis Alberto de Cuenca, nos cuenta en el pr√≥logo de mi edici√≥n que la idea de crear al rey de los vampiros le surgi√≥ a Stoker tras cenar un indigesto centollo."
81,Carolyn Marie  Castagna,Wuthering Heights,"Nov 24, 2019",5,"My first re-read*

This story is still one of a kind! 

First read (November 2019)*

This book is truly one of a kind! I have never read a book so full of dislikable characters, but still feeling so attached to them at the same time. 
I am in awe of the Bront√´ sisters and can't wait to keep reading more of their work. 
Few books make me feel as if the setting is its own character, and Wuthering Heights is definitely its own entity. I could feel her descriptions in my bones! The cold harsh rain storms that overpower the Moors, the vast hills and twisting trees!! It was an incredible reading experience, and now I am so excited to delve deeper into Emily Bront√´'s poetry since this is unfortunately her only novel! Yet, what a novel it is!! üçÅüçÇ"
82,Adina,Brave New World,"Jan 06, 2014",5,"I finally managed to finish the dystopian classics triangle - 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and Brave new World. For me the winner is Brave New World. Although I find the world imagined is less realistic than the other two it is equally tragic. 

I finally got that somewhat lost feeling of total happiness when reading a book, that tingle in the pleasure receptors when you find a great book. Even though I recently read many books that I loved I seem to have lost that feeling of satisfaction when being face to face with an IT book. I thought the reason was that I started to read more, a lot more. Before Goodreads I used to read 10-15 book/year max so I had more time to enjoy a book, to get lost in it. Although I was happy that I read more and that I managed to finish books that I wanted to read for a long time the intensity of the feelings that reading stir in me had diminished. I am so elated that I can still get immersed in a book with all my being. I am so happy that I realized the problem is not how many books I read but what I read and the relationship I build with that book/author. I‚Äôll keep reading when/what/how much I want to knowing that from time to time (probably once-twice/year) I will find that book that will make me remember why I read. 

When I started BNW I thought that it was going to be another one of those books that you know they are a work of art an appreciate them but in the same time are not very pleasant to read. Something like the Hunger by Hamsun or The Stranger by Camus. The beginning was really uncomfortable, especially the descriptions of the embryos and the erotic child games. Brrr. My hair stood up reading that. However, I quickly got absorbed and loved every second spent reading."
83,Emma Giordano,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Jun 29, 2014",5,I don't even think I can truly convey how much I loved this book other than to say it was entirely life changing and I'm so upset it took me this long to read it.
84,Stella,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Jun 25, 2010",5,"If I fail my exams this week, I blame this book.

Ah Ender's Game, how you have sat on my bookshelf for over a year before I got to you. You have been so nicely received by the sci-fi community so why did I put you off? BECAUSE I WAS STUPID, THAT IS WHY.

My stupidity aside, I hope you guys will still consider this 5-star review to be credible and valid. I'll list off the pros and cons to this novel and you can decide.

Pros:
An adorable main character. 
Ender (Andrew) Wiggins was a breath of fresh air from the strong heroine of YA literature. Being a 6 year old at the beginning of the novel, I was completely caught off guard by his maturity and how sneaky he was.

The tactics used in the Game.
The reason the Hunger Games was interesting to me were solely due to the tactics Katniss used to stay alive, Well, guess what? Ender Wiggins just pretty much kick this Katniss chick's butt. Ender almost reminded me of Alexander the Great or Napoleon and I LOVED IT.

Oh the perceptive of Valentine and Peter was also very fascinating. The political backdrop highlighted by Demosthenes and Locke was very refreshing for a science student like me. 

Now, I shall move on to the cons:
The lack of romance.
OMG WHO AM I SUPPOSE TO SHIP NOW? NO DARK, MYSTERIOUS BOY WHO THE MAIN CHARACTER CAN FEEL SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED FOR.

Haha, just kidding. I am glad the focus was on Ender and his growth to his maximum potential. The lack of romantic development is one of the best thing about this novel. I find romance takes away from such a masterpiece.

Just to be clear, there are no cons to this book. I am just a fool who never listen to others' opinions and it often comes back to bite me in the rear.

Joke's on me, I suppose."
85,Richard,The Catcher in the Rye,"Jul 31, 2007",1,"My theory as to this book's unusually polarizing nature: either you identify with Holden Caulfield or you don't.

Those who see themselves (either as they were or, God help them, as they are) in Holden see a misunderstood warrior-poet, fighting the good fight against a hypocritical and unfeeling world; they see in Salinger a genius because he gets it, and he gets them.

Those of us who don't relate to Holden see in him a self-absorbed whiner, and in Salinger, a one-trick-pony who lucked into performing his trick at a time when some large fraction of America happened to be in the right collective frame of mind to perceive this boring twaddle as subversive and meaningful."
86,Madeline,Gone with the Wind,"Dec 26, 2010",5,"There's an episode of The Simpsons where Apu, the Indian owner of the Kwik-E-Mart, takes the American citizenship test. Apu, who throughout the episode has demonstrated a much stronger grasp of American history than any of the American-born characters, is at the oral exam stage of the test. His examiner, a bored white guy, is asking the questions, and the following exchange occurs:

""BORED WHITE GUY: Okay, last question - what was the cause of the Civil War? 

APU: Actually, there were numerous causes. Aside from the obvious schism between abolitionists and anti-abolitionists, economic factors both domestic and international contributed - 

BORED WHITE GUY: Just say slavery, okay?

APU: Slavery it is, sir!""

That series of quotes, I think, perfectly reflects my experience leading up to reading Gone With the Wind. Like most children who attended a public school above the Mason-Dixon line, my first exposure to the Civil War was basically, ""The South wanted to keep slaves, and the North knew that was wrong, so we went to war to free the slaves. And then we won, and everything was happy."" At the other end of the spectrum is Margaret Mitchell, who grew up listening to Confederate veterans tell stories about the war, but she didn't learn that the South had actually lost until she was ten years old. So obviously, her epic story about the Civil War was going to paint a very different picture than the one I had grown up thinking was correct. 

Going into the book, I was steeling myself for lots of good old fashioned racism, and was surprised at what I found. Yes, the characters are racist. But they're all racist - black and white - and what interested me most was that class, rather than race, seemed to matter most. Scarlett and the other white characters hate lower-class whites a hell of a lot more than they hate blacks, and the blacks themselves draw very distinct class lines. Pork, the O'Hara's butler, looks down not only on poor whites but also on black characters of a lower social standing than himself. During the war, when only a few loyal slaves have remained at Tara, Scarlett has to farm the land herself and wants Pork to help plow. He refuses, stating angrily that plowing is field hand's work and he has never been a field hand. It is important to note that at this point they are starving, and farming is their only chance at food. 

There's a lot of starving going on in this book, and a lot of fear and unhappiness. When I started the book, I got a little frustrated with how it seemed to be dragging - it takes over 100 pages for the O'Hara's to arrive at the Twelve Oaks barbecue - but as I kept reading, and the novel plunged deeper and deeper into war-torn despair, I realized why Mitchell had spent so much time introducing these characters and their happy, easy pre-war lives: once the war starts, there is not a single truly happy moment for the rest of the book. Once all the men ride away from the barbecue to volunteer to fight, all that comes next is 800 pages of starvation and fear and death and sadness. We need those detailed descriptions of the plantations, the clothes, the food, the luxury, so we can understand how much Scarlett and her friends have lost. Near the middle of the book, when Scarlett is going barefoot and stealing food to keep from starving, we understand her longing when she thinks back to her life before the war, because we remember reading this description of the Twelve Oaks barbecue: 

""The long trestled picnic table, covered with the finest of the Wilkes' linen, always stood under the thickest shade, with the backless benches on either side; and chairs, hassocks and cushions from the house were scattered about the glade for those who did not fancy the benches. At a distance great enough to keep the smoke away from the guests were the long pits where the meat cooked and the huge iron wash-pots from which the succulent odors of barbecue sauce and Brunswick stew floated."" 

We get only this brief, wonderful glimpse of the luxurious life these people were living, and then the war starts and everything goes straight to hell, like an 1800's version of the The Road:

""The gray troops passed by empty mansions, deserted farms, lonely cabins with doors ajar. Here and there some lone woman remained with a few frightened slaves, and they came to the road to cheer the soldiers, to bring buckets of water for the thirsty men, to bind up the wounds and bury their dead in their own family burying ground. But for the most part the sunny valley was abandoned and desolate and the untended crops stood in parching fields.""

The war destroyed not only a region, but an entire way of life for thousands of people, and you can see Margaret Mitchell's mourning for this lost era in every page. 

""They looked the same but different. What was it? Was it only that they were five years older? No, it was something more than the passing of time. Something had gone out of them, out of their world. Five years ago, a feeling of security had wrapped them all around so gently they were not even aware of it. In its shelter they had flowered. Now it was gone and with it had gone the old thrill, the old sense of something delightful and exciting just around the corner, the old glamour of their way of living. 
...An ageless dignity, a timeless gallantry still clung about them and would cling until they died but they would carry undying bitterness to their graves, a bitterness too deep for words. They were a soft-spoken, fierce, tired people who were defeated and would not know defeat, broken yet still standing determinedly erect."" 

This review is getting long-winded, and I've only started to explain everything about this book that makes it 5 stars. Aside from the history, the tone, the description, the general epic-ness of this epic, there are also the characters. And good lord. I could write another review entirely devoted to all the characters and why they are awesome despite being the last people you'd want to be in stuck in a room with, but I'll shorten it to a few characters. 

Scarlett: Her transformation alone, from innocent flirt to flinty miser, is amazing in itself, but she's a powerful character no matter what stage she happens to be in. That being said, I hate hate hated her - I hated her shallowness, I hated her ""unanalytical"" mind, I hated her stupid crush on stupid useless Ashely, and she was so astoundingly unobservant throughout the book that it was all I could do not to scream at the pages. She was a great character, but that doesn't mean I have to like her.

Ashely: Christ, what a schmuck. 

Mammy: The only character in the book I'd actually enjoy sitting down with. She had all the other character's best qualities, and none of their glaring faults. She had Melanie's grace, Ashely's kindness, Scarlett's strength, and Rhett's survival instincts. Mammy rocked my world. 

Melanie: I kept going back and forth, switching between ""she's the dumbest person ever"" to ""she's the best person in this book."" I still can't really be sure where I stand on Melanie. I would want her on my side, but like Scarlett, I might want to slap her every now and then. 

Rhett: Oh, Rhett. I so wanted to like him. And I did, when he was telling off the Confederates or Scarlett, when he was putting people in their place, and when he was being the only sensible character in the goddamn book. But then he would talk to Scarlett, and I would be drowned in wave after wave of smirking condescension. He was rude and selfish and had that attitude of ""silly woman, your anger is so amusing"" that is an instant dealbreaker for me. I suffer from PTTD (Post-Traumatic Twilight Disorder) so whenever I encounter a male character who exhibits even a little bit of condescension and protective instincts towards the womenfolk, I start twitching and picturing Robert Pattinson's ugly face simpering ""I like to watch you sleep"", and then I have to watch old episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer until the shakes stop. S ultimately, my verdict on Rhett was that he could go fuck himself and wipe that stupid smirk off his face."

I should stop fooling myself thinking that there's ever getting better at bracing through these WWII stories... or any war stories for that matter, whether they are based on real events or completely fictional. But then, they are some of the most important books anyone can ever read, capable change one's whole belief systems and priorities in life while improving the reader's ability to empathize tremendously. For me, The Book Thief turned out to be one such exceptional story.


""Like most misery, it started with apparent happiness.""


When it comes to enjoying a story, different readers obviously look for different things from plot to style of writing, complex/ interesting characters, world building, the flow, and many more. What's strange about The Book Thief is, while it has nothing special going on in terms of aforementioned characteristics (may be with the exception of the beautiful writing), the book affects the reader in a most profound way. I believe it's because of the undistorted nature of the underlying story, leading up to a heartbreaking, yet perfectly realistic ending. When you realize the events are not further from the truth, it's quite easy to become overwhelmed with emotions here. But I believe that's the whole point of a story like this.


""The human child - so much cannier at times than the stupefying ponderous adult.""



""A DEFINITION NOT FOUND IN THE DICTIONARY - Not leaving: an act of trust and love, often deciphered by children.""


But that doesn't mean the story is lacking in anyway when it comes to characters or storytelling. Though Zusak is not attempting to go out of the way to create and outstanding main character, the realistic development of Liesel Meminger is absolutely beautiful; it's hard not to fall in love with her. The secondary characters are equally wonderful, though that ending makes it all the more difficult to brace against, having being acquainted with them that well. 


""Presents#1-#13: A smashed ball. One ribbon. One pinecone. One button. One stone. One feather. Two newspapers. A candy wrapper. A cloud. One toy soldier. One miraculous leaf. A finished whistler. A slab of grief.""


One thing I might not be in the majority here is the narrator, the Death. I didn't hate it by any means, but for me, it didn't seem completely necessary to use such point of view, though I understand the author's intention to introduce a unique perspective. But on the plus side, the reader do get some advance warnings about certain disappointment down the line. It was a little strange at times, coming across those 'spoiler' type warnings, like the ones related to Rudy. At first, I had assumed may be it was the author being considerate, allowing the readers to brace themselves. But the actual ending came with an unbelievable shock, making the warnings about Rudy - though still quite painful - becoming only a fraction of the disappointment. It was an unforgiving , yet very realistic ending.


""If I beat you, I get to kiss you.""


This is the kind of book, which makes one feel like there's not enough stars to do justice. Like I said before, for me, it's not about literary devices when it comes to a book like this. It's all about authentic nature of the story, and the ability to affect the reader in a profound way. The satisfies both of these things perfectly. The Book Thief easily made it to my all-time-favorites and I believe this should be read by everyone. As far as the emotions go, this not an easy read, especially towards the end, but it's worth the effort.

90,Shannon,Crime and Punishment,"May 24, 2008",1,"My star rating is purely subjective and means only what GR says it means: I didn't like it. It didn't mean anything to me, sadly, and I didn't even find it to be an interesting story. I'm not saying it's a terrible book; in fact, I'd be very interested to hear what others think (reviews are a bit light for this book here I see). 

First, I have a confession to make: I got two thirds of the way through and skimmed the rest. Well, worse than that: I flipped through and got the gist, but such is the way it's written you can't even skim. I just really had to put the book to rest, and it made me feel miserable thinking about making myself keep reading it. Reading should never make you miserable, so I did something I rarely ever do, and it nags at me but, well, there you have it.

The premise sounds interesting, and I had high hopes it would be one that would suck me in and captivate me. It's not that I had particularly high expectations - I didn't really have any expectations, though I thought it might be heavy on the intellectual side of things - but it was apparent from fairly early on that it wasn't going to be my kind of book.

It's Petersburg and a young student, Raskolnikov, is pawning his only valuables to an old crone, Alyona Ivanovna, who lives in a small apartment with her sister Lizaveta. He hasn't been able to afford to go to uni in several months, and his dress and manner makes him seem even lower class than he is. In desperation he hatches a plan to murder Alyona and rob her. He carries this out, killing not just her but her simple-minded sister who returns home unexpectedly, and in his fear and haste flees the scene with only some pawned trinkets and a small pouch.

His guilt manifests itself in fever and delirium, and he behaves very strangely thereafter. His friend and fellow student, Razumikhin, puts up with an awful lot and generously gives his time and efforts to help Raskolnikov; his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna and his sister, Dunechka, come to town to prepare for Dunya's marriage to an odious man; and Raskolnikov becomes somewhat obsessed with the family of a poor alcoholic who dies early on, in particular his eldest daughter Sonya, who had to become a prostitute in order to make some money for her family.

There's a lot of twoing and froing, a lot of agonising on Raskolnikov's part, and a lot of exclaiming. I wouldn't even have minded but Raskolnikov became such a bore, I didn't even want to slap, I just wanted to ignore him. It comes down mostly to the way it was written, which I didn't care for and which made the book a real slog.

I know this is some kind of work of genius, but if that's true, then I just felt stupid. It all seemed pretty obvious to me. No doubt if I made the effort I could see something special here, but it's like The Red and the Black - other people find the psychological melodrama truly fascinating, but to me, it's just melodrama, which I loathe. There's also no mystery, and not much suspense. There's a somewhat clever police inspector investigating the murder, but the game of cat-and-mouse the blurb enticed me with fell flat pretty quickly, and there was nothing left to hold me. 

The blurb describes the book as ""a preternaturally acute investigation of the forces that impel a man toward sin, suffering and grace."" Uh huh. You can tell I'm really impressed can't you? It reads more like an account of a man going mad and being really self-centred, but after my sorry lack of appreciation for the equally masterful The Red and the Black, is it any surprise that I didn't like this book at all? If you're looking for a good story, this isn't it."
91,Joel,The Outsiders,"Jul 01, 2010",4,"Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold.

***********

The Outsiders is a book about sensitive teenage boys who alternately get into gang fights, hug one another, and burst into tears. They also spend more time than you might expect ruminating on how the tightness of a t-shirt might enhance the rippling musculature of a steely-eyed fellow gang member (this is where Stephanie Meyer got the idea for how to characterize Edward). Even though they're always complimenting each other's hair and doing gymnastics, it's not gay at all because it takes place in 1965, shortly after James Dean had made crying and homoerotic tension cool.

This is the kind of book that teachers like to assign to 7th graders (or dumb high schoolers) because it offers up a lot of THEMES about how EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT BUT STILL THE SAME, and teachers feel pretty safe giving a quiz on that because even the stupidest kid can figure it out, as every few paragraphs the narrator will just go ahead and state it outright, like this: ""Even though we're Greasers and they're Socs, I guess in the end, we all look at the same sunset."" (Sample essay question: What did Ponyboy mean when he said that everyone looked at the same sunset? And all you have to do to get it right is repeat the first half of the sentence.)

As a narrator, Ponyboy kept reminding me of Holden Caulfied, if Holden was poor and actually managed to do anything interesting with his evenings. But maybe that just has to do with the time period and the fact that they both say stuff like ""I was just about bawling my eyes out, to tell you the truth"" every few pages, except Ponyboy is doing it because his best friend knifed someone and then died of a broken back and being on fire, and Holden is just sad because his roommate smells bad (oh and I guess his brother got cancer and died pffffft). I do think they would get along if they ever met, and maybe make out a little bit.

I love the last few sentences of every chapter, where SE Hinton trots out her corniest stuff. Chapter 7: ""Socs were just guys after all. Things were rough all over, but it was better that way. That way you could tell the other guy was human too."" Chapter 8: ""'Thanks, Ponyboy.' She smiled through her tears. 'You dig okay.' She had green eyes. I went on, walking home slowly."" Oh and it doesn't come at the end of a chapter but: ""Not even the rattling of the train could keep me awake, and I went to sleep in a hoodlum's jacket, with a gun lying next to my hand."" There's also the best deathbed speech in all of teen literature (probably), which goes like this: ""INTERPRETS THEMATICALLY RELEVANT POEM"" (DIES).

So somehow I never read this in middle school, and when I read it now, I just end up giggling at half of the overwrought emotion (which happened with Catcher in the Rye too, but there I'm going to assume Salinger was writing on multiple levels, because he was a competent adult, whereas The Outsiders was written by someone Holden's age). But it's still a pretty awesome book.

EDITED to add that this Penguin edition makes the book seem really classy, which is nice, but Jodi Picoult's introduction is kind of a joke. She basically asked her 14-year-old son to write a book report and quoted excerpts.

95,Nora,Lord of the Flies,"Sep 25, 2007",1,"I read this book a long time ago, long enough to where I barely remembered anything past the basic premise. So I picked it up again, only to wish I hadn't. There's a reason why they teach this book in middle school--in order to enjoy this book, one's intellectual cognizance must be that of a child, because otherwise you'll spend the entire time picking out everything that's wrong with the book. And there's a lot to pick out.

From what little of the story that is actually coherent, I can see why this book has had a lasting effect on social commentary since it's initial publishing. The overlying illustration of how easily man can devolve back to his feral instincts is striking, yet could have been infinitesimally more effective in the hands of a decent writer. 

See, I would have cared a bit more about the little island society of prepubescent boys and their descent into barbarism if you know, any of the characters had been developed AT ALL. Instead, we're thrown interchangeable names of interchangeable boys who are only developed enough to conform to the basic archetypes Golding requires to hobble his little story along: The Leader, The Rebel, The Fat-Kid, The Nose-Picker, etc. Were he born in this time, I believe Golding would have done brilliantly as a scriptwriter for reality TV. 

And the plot? There's a plot? I'm guessing so, since things seem to happen, but it's kind of hard to tell since he spends pages describing irrelevant events that are never incorporated, characters that possibly exist yet probably don't, and using words that don't mean what he thinks they mean. And as the main characters are a bunch of kids not worth caring about, thus goes the way of the story.

And the prose? Dear God, the prose! Get it away! It burns us! 

So yeah, this book sucked. It had potential. There were even a few parts I internally squealed at in hopeful anticipation. But whatever potential it did have was hopelessly squandered by a man who wrote like he'd never written anything before in his life. Don't waste your time."

97,Stephen,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Mar 15, 2010",5,"Arguably literature's greatest study of shallowness, vanity, casual cruelty and hedonistic selfishness, Wilde lays it down here with ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!! This was my first experience in reading Oscar Wilde and the man‚Äôs gift for prose and dialogue is magical. This story read somewhat like a dark, corrupted Jane Austen in that the writing was snappy and pleasant on the ear, but the feeling it left you with was one of hopelessness and despair. 

The level of cynicism and societal disregard that Wilde‚Äôs characters display towards humanity is simply staggering. Despite the dark (or more likely because of it) this is one of the most engaging, compelling and lyrical pieces of literature I have read. The quality of the prose is nothing short masterful. 

I assume most people know the basic outline of the plot, but I will give you a few sentences on it. The three main characters are Basil Hallward, Lord Henry Wotton and Dorian Gray. Basil Hallward is an artist who after painting a picture of Dorian Gray becomes obsessed with him because of his beauty (the homosexual vs. art object love Basil feels towards Dorian are left vague, likely because of the time it was written). Dorian then meets a friend Basil‚Äôs, Lord Henry, and becomes enthralled with Lord Henry‚Äôs world view, which is a form of extreme hedonism that posits the only worthwhile life is one spent pursuing beauty and satisfaction for the senses.
The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.
 Well at one point, Dorian utters the famous words quoted at the beginning of my review and the ‚ÄúFaustian‚Äù bargain is struck.
 
While this story is often mentioned among the classics of the Horror genre (which I do have a problem with) this is much more a study of the human monster than it is some boogeyman. My favorite parts of the story were the extensive dialogues between the characters, usually Dorian and Lord Henry. They were wonderfully perverse and display a level of casual cruelty and vileness towards humanity that make it hard to breathe while reading. Oh, and Lord Henry reserves particular offense for the female of the species, to wit: 
My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.
. 



YES folks...he absolutely did. 

One of the most intriguing quotes I have seen from Oscar Wilde regarding this book is his comparison of himself to the three main characters. He said that he wrote the three main characters as reflections of himself. Wilde said, ‚ÄúBasil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be‚Äîin other ages, perhaps.‚Äù

I was somewhat floored by this as I found Dorian to be a truly stark representation of evil and could not see how Wilde could find an idealized form within the character. When I say evil, I don't mean just misguided or weak-minded, someone bamboozled by the clever lectures of Lord Henry. I found Gray to be selfish, vain, inhumanly callous and sadistically cruel. I intend to try and learn more about Wilde‚Äôs outlook on this character as it truly escapes me.

Regardless, this is a towering piece of literature. Beautifully written and filled with memorable characters and a deeply moving story. A novel deserving of its status as a classic of English Literature. 5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!!

P.S. For of audiobooks. I listened to the audio version of this read by Michael Page who has become one of my favorite narrators. His performance here was amazing."
98,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),Lord of the Flies,"Aug 03, 2022",5,"How are dictators being made? Mein Kampf, Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare, The Last King of Scotland and Sandstorm: Libya in the Time of Revolution, won't answer this question perfectly. William Golding has the perfect answer to it through this allegory. 

How can a novel about a bunch of stranded school kids teach us about dictators?

This is not just a novel about school boys. This is a novel about the intricate ways the human psyche performs when it is stretched to the paramount in abominable circumstances when liberty is abundant, and everyone is equal, without any prerogatives.

This parable hits the right chord to enlighten us regarding our leniency to entropy. This is exactly how dictators are made. The boys teach us a lot of lessons through the way they behave and the areas they remain silent.






What I learned from this book 


1) Who is the beast in the Lord of the flies? 

There is a chance that some people will try to read this novel superficially without thinking about its deeper meaning. It is the concept of the beast discussed by the author that they will ultimately get stuck after being confused. We can interpret the beast in many ways depending on our conscience. 

The simplest explanation of the beast is that it is the basic instinct of savagery existing in the minds of human beings.  You can interpret it in many complicated ways based on your thinking level.
 ‚ÄúMaybe there is a beast‚Ä¶ maybe it's only us.‚Äù 
 


2) Are human beings behaving in a civilized manner just because of the laws that he has to follow? 

This is a tricky question to answer. But it becomes an easy question if you have read this book and contemplated it for some time.
 ‚ÄúWhich is better--to have laws and agree, or to hunt and kill?‚Äù 

""The rules!"" shouted Ralph, ""you're breaking the rules!""
""Who cares?""  


3) What is the easiest way to know about the personality of a person? 

Golding metaphorically tells us the easiest way to understand the personality of a person. 

It is said that personality is who we are and what we do when everybody is watching and character is what we are and what we do when nobody is watching.

The way a person talks to older people, his subordinates, and disabled people tells us a lot about their character. These are the groups of people who cannot stand up as equals for their rights.

We know that adversity builds and reveals character. We can see the author's brilliance by the way how he culminated all the above-mentioned ideas and brilliantly revealed them to us through the behavior of a few stranded children.
 ""He wanted to explain how people were never quite what you thought they were.""  



My favourite three lines from this book 

 ‚ÄúThe greatest ideas are the simplest.‚Äù 

 ‚ÄúWhat are we? Humans? Or animals? Or savages?""  

  ""I believe man suffers from an appalling ignorance of his own nature. I produce my own view in the belief that it may be something like the truth.""  
 

What could have been better?

Some people may say this novel has extreme racist remarks and body shaming. There is also some content that some readers might find explicit. 

This novel was published on 17 September 1954. It would be best if you kept this in the back of your mind while reading it. It is because some people are viewing this book through the current lens of political correctness they find it disturbing. That is one of the greatest injustices we can do to any literary creation.


Rating 

 5/5 This novel is one among those few masterpieces that can be read in many ways depending on the reader's proclivity."
99,Eve Hogan,Gone with the Wind,"Aug 11, 2007",5,"I honestly do not know whether to give this book 5 stars for being one of the most completely engrossing, shocking, and emotionally absorbing pieces of literature ever written, or to give it 0 stars for being the most tragic, unendingly upsetting, disturbing book I've ever read. I read the last 50 pages or so literally with my mouth wide open, unable to believe that it was really going to be THAT tragically sad. When I finally finished, I walked downstairs in a daze, handed the book to my husband, and told him to burn it and never let me see it again. Throughout the book, I frantically kept reading, often until 2am or later, just to see when it would turn around and start getting happy, but there was never any redemption - it NEVER got happy or uplifting. It just kept spiraling down, down, into despair. Maybe after a few days I will be able to step back and give it a proper rating (I just finished it last night, and am still reeling from it).... 

UPDATE: After about a week, I have decided to give this book a 5, because any piece of fiction that can have that strong an effect on a reader deserves the highest ranking possible! Besides, I've found that, no matter how tragic and sometimes unlikeable the chartacters were, I am still thinking about them days after I finished reading. I almost miss them! They have truly come alive for me. Besides, who doesn't love a good emotional roller coaster every once in a while?!"
100,Emily May,The Lightning Thief ,"Sep 30, 2013",4,"Were you a bit weird in school? Or are you still in school and think you're kinda weird? I mean, everyone is weird, but you know that I mean. Maybe you didn't fit in, maybe people thought you were a bit of a loser. Maybe you had learning difficulties, were a target for bullies, got into trouble a lot, maybe it seemed like your teachers just didn't like you. Maybe you sucked at reading and were even diagnosed with dyslexia. Or ADHD.

Well, don't worry. Truth is, you're actually most likely a child of the gods with secret powers that enable you to zap those bullies and fulfill your true destiny. Screw school, you've got bigger things to deal with anyway. 

Lol, this book is amazing. My only regret is that I didn't have it when I was twelve years old because I would have read this until it was falling apart in my hands. Every insecure kid (so basically every kid) should read The Lightning Thief. I would want my hypothetical kids of the future to read this book. It's the ultimate childhood fantasy - discovering that everything people labelled as ""weird"" or negative about you is actually caused by your secret awesomeness. Pretty perfect message, if you ask me. 

I know, I know - this is plain old childhood wish fulfillment at its finest. But who cares? The best kids books are all about wish fulfillment to some extent and it's not like Percy Jackson doesn't have his fair share of enemies and heartache. It's the same idea that we all loved to buy into. The orphaned and neglected Harry Potter discovering he is a wizard. The nerdy loser-ish Peter Parker developing special abilities and becoming Spiderman. Children in the middle of WWII discovering a secret world through a wardrobe door in which they reign as royalty. Percy Jackson finding out he is the son of a god and has his own super powers. 

On top of the powerful message, this is a fast-paced exciting fantasy story full of friendships, Greek mythology, magic, mystery, bad guys and girls, and constant adventure. I enjoyed it now, despite me being a good ten years older than the target audience. I would have enjoyed it even more ten years ago. You should definitely go read this. Then, when you're done, give it to a kid to read too.

101,B0nnie,Brave New World,"May 05, 2012",4,"Brave New World is a vision of the future where science will (at last) be put full time into the service of our needs. Some of the ideas might seem a little controversial (because of our preconceived ideas) but we must be open minded...! 




SEX. Biology teaches that sex is meant to be had. To put restrictions on sex is as silly as putting restrictions on which chair to sit. And like chairs, women are meant to be pneumatic. ""Oh, she‚Äôs a splendid girl. Wonderfully pneumatic. I‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt had her.""




BIRTH. Why should modern man have to put up with it? Any informed person will affirm it is gross: all meat and blood and pain. Science will solve this problem with advances in reproductive technology: thinking outside the box. ""Which brings us at last,"" continued Mr. Foster, ""out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature into the much more interesting world of human invention.""




CHILDREN. If you've been to a supermarket you will have seen plenty of bad parenting. How often have you wanted to step in and rectify the situation? Let's take the important job of citizen building out of the hands of amateurs. There's a good reason some of the foulest language we use involve the word *Mother*. ""Psychically, [home] was a rabbit hole, a midden, hot with the frictions of tightly packed life, reeking with emotion. What suffocating intimacies, what dangerous, insane, obscene relationships between the members of the family group! Maniacally, the mother brooded over her children (her children) ‚Ä¶ brooded over them like a cat over its kittens; but a cat that could talk, a cat that could say, ""My baby, my baby,"" over and over again."" 




PEACE OF MIND. This is something we all want. Yet we must contend with traffic jams, lost cellphones, and raised voices. The frustration you feel is the result of a chemical reaction in your brain. Thus it is only natural that Science should offer a chemical solution. ""A gramme in time saves nine""




DEATH. The problem here is not death per se. It is our poor attitude toward it. Rigorous psychology will help us achieve complete indifference and thus free up a lot of wasted time. ""...what fatal mischief he might do to these poor innocents? Undoing all their wholesome death-conditioning with this disgusting outcry‚Äîas though death were something terrible, as though any one mattered as much as all that!""




BOOKS. These are only needed for reference and factual information. Reading in itself is profoundly antisocial. And, although there is little danger of anyone actually reading Shakespeare, his works are especially egregious in provoking time wasting thoughts.""Do they read Shakespeare?"" asked the Savage as they walked, on their way to the Bio-chemical Laboratories, past the School Library. ""Certainly not,"" said the Head Mistress, blushing. ""Our library,"" said Dr. Gaffney, ""contains only books of reference. If our young people need distraction, they can get it at the feelies. We don‚Äôt encourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.""





RELIGION. The absurdity of religion is self-evident, as every nonconforming individual knows. If there must be faith, let it be bright. Let it be in science. ""As if one believed anything by instinct! One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them. Finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons‚Äîthat‚Äôs philosophy. People believe in God because they‚Äôve been conditioned to believe in God.""




LOVE. Love is the unifying idea in each of the above themes - certainly the most destructive concept ever to exist. Shakespeare of course has been largely responsible for its glorification. Brave New World is a world without pain, without hunger, with total comfort. It is a world without love.

102,Bryon Cahill,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Mar 21, 2008",1,"I started reading ""A Wrinkle In Time"" when I was 8 or 10. I say started because I never finished it. I can't remember exactly why, but I think it kind of scared the crap out of me. Now, 15 or 17 years later, I've read it again (this time the whole thing) and there's really nothing scary at all about it. It's possible that, as a kid, I was somehow relating this book to the terribly scary Disney movie ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"". Again, I don't know why.

Whatever the reason for my fears, the book is not spectacular. Maybe I can't see it now being older and not reading through the eyes of a child, but I can't understand how it won the John Newberry Medal. The witches were plastic and seemed to serve little purpose; the bad guy, a concept embodied in a shadow, had no motivation (if you want to read about true darkness for the sake of darkness/nothing for the sake of nothing, pick up Michael Ende's ""The Neverending Story""); and the father, who seems to have no backbone and no sense of decency when it comes to saving his son. It has been said that the father character is an excellent tool in showing children that parents do not always have the answers, that they are, in fact, fallible and (God forbid) imperfect. But it's so much more than that. He comes across as weak, helpless, foolish, and even heartless at times. If you want to write a story where a child finds out that his/her parents aren't perfect, you don't have to make the parental figure a cold, bumbling idiot. Unless that's what you're going for. And I certainly don't think that L'Engle was. But all that aside, why would you even want to tell that story? Part of the beauty of being a child is you get to hold onto the illusion that mom and dad are Superman. Why ruin that? Granted, some kids live in terrible families, but there are better ways to write about those scenarios. This is not it.

I wanted to give this book 2 stars but decided that, because of my jaded, critical age I cannot judge too harshly. Plus, I did like the savant character of Charles Wallace. He was cute. As was the love that Meg and him shared. Calvin, on the other hand, was a complete throwaway character.

If I had kids, would I push this book on them? No. If they picked it off my bookshelf and started reading it, I wouldn't stop them. But I'm not about to recommend it to anyone young or old. Unless it's too ask that person to help me understand what the big deal is."
103,‚ú® A ‚ú®,Pride and Prejudice,"Aug 03, 2020",5,"I don't think I will ever be able to properly explain my obsession with this book. 

Everytime I read Pride and Prejudice (though it‚Äôs been many years since I‚Äôve done a reread) I find something else to love about it.

Jane Austen renders a beautiful display of English country life in the early 1800s and the complexity of ordinary people ‚Äî all their vanities, their flaws and their quirks.

The writing is lush and descriptive with a slow melting pace filled with subtle humour, sarcasm and witty banter.

‚ÄúBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.‚Äù

The author created a fantastic and varied cast of characters. The absurdities of the secondary characters are what kept the plot light and fun.

Elizabeth‚Äôs whole family (excluding Jane) were a trainwreck of silly individuals.

But none are like Mr Collins. This man never fails to astound me with his silliness. The things he said were half ridiculously funny and the other half of the time I just wanted to smack him.

Characters like Miss Bingley, Mr Wickham and Lady Catherine were also infuriating at times.

Something I always find extremely entertaining in these types of classics is the underhanded savagery delivered through a facade of polite smiles and impeccable manners. It‚Äôs admirable, really üòÇ .

But let‚Äôs talk about our otp.

We have Elizabeth Bennet who does not care about societal expectations. She will not marry for anything less than love and mutual respect. And would rather marry no one than marry someone she couldn‚Äôt love. For the time that this book was published, this was revolutionary as women had little power and choice.

Lizzy is strong minded and makes hasty judgments but I adore her loyalty and admire her fierce protectiveness of those she cares about. She soon learns to not judge too quickly after a few too many misunderstandings.

‚ÄúThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.‚Äù

And then we have Darcy who is our socially awkward wreck who doesn‚Äôt know how to talk to people and hides his uncomfortability behind a mask of arrogance. What I loved most about his arc is that he listens, reflects on his behavior and strives to be better. He grows into someone worthy of Lizzy‚Äôs respect without the expectation of her returning his feelings.

Can y‚Äôall hear me swooning over here?

‚ÄúNow be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the liveliness of your mind, I did.‚Äù

The romance isn‚Äôt a wild passion, but a slow build between two people who are wrong in their first impressions of one another, then grow to admire the other.

It‚Äôs soft, it‚Äôs gentle and it‚Äôs e v e r y t h i n g.

If you‚Äôre looking to get into reading Austen, or even classics in general, I really think Pride and Prejudice is the place to start. It‚Äôs a smooth read and the story is so well known it will be easy to follow. [üëà This is me trying to be subtle when actually I want to shout at everyone to read this book üòÅ

104,Stephen,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Jun 04, 2011",5,"Like diamonds and roses hidden under bomb rubble, this is a story of intense beauty and strength buried under the surface of the cruel and capricious life imposed upon two Afghani women. 
 She remembered Nana saying once that each snowflake was a sigh heaved by an aggrieved woman somewhere in the world. That all the sighs drifted up the sky, gathered into clouds, then broke into tiny pieces that fell silently on the people below. As a reminder of how people like us suffer, she'd said. How quietly we endure all that falls upon us.
 Staggeringly beautiful and deep and rich and sad and frightening and infuriating. There‚Äôs a lot I want to say about this book and so I cry your pardon if this review is a bit of a rambler. You should definitely read this book. I‚Äôll probably repeat this again, but I want to make sure I don‚Äôt forget to say it. Buy the book and read it.
 
I love good historical fiction, especially when set in places and/or periods of which I am not very familiar. Afghanistan certainly fit that description, which makes me feel a significant amount of personal shame given how intertwined the country has been with the history of the U.S. over the last 30 years. That same time frame is also the primary focus of the novel so I feel like I got a real taste of the history of this mysterious time. 

That said, the historical events described in the novel are merely spice for the narrative and are clearly not the entr√©e at this literary feast. However, I would likely recommend this book for the historical component alone even if I didn‚Äôt like the rest of the novel‚Ä¶oh, but I did so much like the rest of the novel. 

The story revolves around two women, Mariam and Laila, born 20 years apart, but whose lives are intertwined through the events of the novel. Mariam (born in 1959) is the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy merchant named Jalil who has 3 wives and 9 ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù children. Mariam‚Äôs mother, Nana, was a servant in Jalil‚Äôs house whose affair with Jalil resulted in Mariam. As you might expect, the 3 wives were less than enthused and Nana and Mariam were forced to live on the outskirts of town, making Nana a bitter often cruel person to Mariam. 

The other main character is Laila (born in 1978) who lives in the same area as Mariam. Laila‚Äôs story begins with her close friendship with a boy named Tariq who loses a leg to a Soviet land mine when he‚Äôs 5 years old. Years later, with Kabul under constant rocket attacks, Laila‚Äôs family decides to leave the city. During an emotional farewell, Laila and Tariq make love. Later, as her family is preparing to depart Kabul, a rocket kills her parents and severely injures Laila. 

I don‚Äôt want to spoil the plot by giving away too many details, so let me just say that through a series of mostly tragic circumstances, Mariam and Laila both end up married to a serious scumbag named Rasheed. I want to clarify that last remark because I think it goes to the most chilling aspect of the novel for me. One of the novel‚Äôs primary strengths is the bright light the author shines on the nasty way women are treated in countries like Afghanistan. 

Now not being knowledgeable enough about the culture to make a well-informed analysis, I strongly suspect that the character of Rasheed, while made somewhat worse for dramatic effect, is close enough to what was ‚Äúthe norm‚Äù as to be positively sickening. Thus, when I say scumbag (which I whole-heartedly mean), part of the emotional impact of Rasheed‚Äôs actions came from my not seeing them as cartoonish, but as part of an ‚Äúinstitutional evil‚Äù that was all too common. 

Bottom-line, Rasheed is an ignorant, mean-spirited, petty little pile of assbarf who will make even the most serene and passive reader feel like loading the .45 with hollow points and performing a gunpowder enema on his sorry, wretched chair cushion. 

Anyway, once Mariam and Laila find themselves together, the story deepens as these two women slowly learn first to live with each other and later to depend upon each other as they face almost daily challenges, mostly from their abusive husband. 
She lived in fear of his shifting moods, his volatile temperament, his insistence on steering even mundane exchanges down a confrontational path that, on occasion, he would resolve with punches, slaps, kicks, and sometimes try to make amends for with polluted apologies, and sometimes not. 
 The lives of these women is an epic journey in every sense of the word and I felt like I was on a journey of my own as I road along with them. 

While there is much of darkness and pain throughout the book, Hosseini never allows the emotional tone of the story to descend in melodrama. There is little self-pity or wallowing in grief. There is pain, there is loss but there is no surrender. Instead, these women absorb tremendous blows (both figuratively and literally) and continue to live. 

There is a great passage near the end of the book that I am going to hide with a spoiler because it reveals the final fate of one of the characters, but it is simply a perfect summation of the strength and dignity that is the heart of this story. (view spoiler)[
  
 Mariam wished for so much in those final moments. Yet as she closed her eyes, it was not regret any longer but a sensation of abundant peace that washed over her. She thought of her entry into this world, the harami child of a lowly villager, an unintended thing, a pitiable, regrettable accident. A weed. And yet she was leaving the world as a woman who had loved and been loved back. She was leaving it as a friend, a companion, a guardian. A mother. A person of consequence at last. No. It was not so bad, Mariam thought, that she should die this way. Not so bad. This was a legitimate end to a life of illegitimate belongings.

(hide spoiler)] This is a gorgeous, beautiful story that is made all the more so by its tremendous importance. 

Read it‚Ä¶.you will be happy you did. 5.0 Stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! 

P.S. I listened to the audio version of this as read by Atossa Leoni and she was brilliant. If you listen to audio books, this is definitely one where the narrator enhances the experience of the novel."
105,s.penkevich,Of Mice and Men,"Sep 24, 2011",4,"If you want to feel real sad, absorb Steinbeck's pitch perfect prose right to your dome. A worthwhile bummer of a great book.

When I was in college taking teaching courses I graded a lot of homework about this book. It was pretty magical, interacting with a novel I had loved when I read it in school and seeing it again through the opinions of young students. I‚Äôve always found I like a novel more when I can dig into it and being able to be on the teaching side really opened it up further, especially because I was reading key passages over and over again. So this book holds a really special place in my heart."
106,Emily May,Jane Eyre,"Dec 05, 2010",5,"The Brontes fuelled my love for reading and convinced me that the classics weren't all mean, nasty books that fascist teachers made you read in school just to torture you. I grew up with Austen and Dickens, whom I loved, but the Brontes always seemed to come out on top for some reason. Jane Eyre is my second favourite after Wuthering Heights. I love the darkness and sadness of their novels, but the more... quiet style than you'd find in Dickens's wild tales of orphans, drunks and epic family betrayals."

I feel like I should have liked this but I didn't.

I like that death was the narrator, that the main character liked books and the relationship between her and her Papa. 

I was indifferent about the rest. I always feel heartless when I don't care about a WW2 book but... here I am."
108,Shannon,Twilight ,"Sep 27, 2007",5,"Oh my. This book, to me, is like chocolate: a delicious, sinful, addictive indulgence which you convince yourself has beneficial qualities (zinc, calcium, keeps me quiet at that time of the month...) in order to justify your addiction.

By ""beneficial qualities"", I mean that it's reading, and since when is reading bad? :) Let me say quite clearly that I'm a sucker for romance, especially the intense, passionate, tragic kind. I don't read romance novels*, though, because to me they are lacklustre - Meyer's book has the extra edge I need, though, a great way of keeping doom hanging over the main characters' heads: she's human, he's a vampire.

Sound corny? Yeah, I know, and the only reason Meyer gets away with it as well as she does is because Twilight doesn't try to be anything it's not, and it has such conviction. Only Meyer could get away with giving her narrator the name Isabella Swan. She says in her little bio at the back that she wanted to write believable characters: an interesting choice, then, to write about vampires, but I believed in them, and without such a willing suspension of disbelief, the story would have been a farce. True, a lot of people haven't been able to suspend their disbelief with this book, but that doesn't affect my reading experience :)

Seventeen year old Bella's parents are divorced. She lives with her mum in Phoenix, Arizona, and spends time with her dad Charlie in Forks, Washington State, where it rains almost constantly. She hates Forks, but when her mum remarries a baseball player, Phil, and starts travelling with him, Bella decides to move to Forks.

On her first day at school she notices the isolated group of five beautiful, graceful siblings. Rosalie, Alice, Emmet, Edward and Jasper. One in particular catches her eye: Edward Cullen, with his rust-brown hair and topaz eyes. She is more than a little surprised and shocked when he seems to have developed an acute, profound hatred of her. Her fascination deepens, especially when, after a brief disappearance, he saves her life. She soon figures out what Edward is, and the knowledge doesn't frighten her. The shaky friendship between them develops into something much stronger, and Edward reveals his overpowering reaction to her smell that nearly made him kill her on the spot - hence the look on his face that so shocked her, and the restraint he put on himself during an hour of Biology.

Let's not forget he's incredibly handsome: even though Bella describes almost every glance he makes and every twitch of his lips, not once did I get bored and roll my eyes. My fascination grew alongside hers, until I too fell in love with Edward - in a totally girly, daydreamy way. Yes, I admit it. I don't know if that makes this a girly kind of book - these days those boundaries don't seem to matter so much, and the vampire family is pretty darn cool, what with Edward's extra ability to read minds, Alice's premonitions, Jasper's ability to affect people's emotions, their speed, their invincibility... Bella is at one point compared to Lois Lane, because Edward and his kin really are like Superman.

One of the things I love about YA books: the clarity with which they are written. Granted there is some repetition in Twilight, but to me it's necessary repetition. There's nothing superfluous in Twilight, nothing that shouldn't be there, and the flow, the pacing, is great. It's a fat book, but I read it in two days. I read it with breakfast, on my walk to the subway, on the subway, up the escalator, through the ticket gates, to work, in my lunch break ... you get the picture. I couldn't get enough of it, and it left me with that same craving for more that Harry Potter did (I remember scrounging around for loose change as soon as I finished one of them and dashing off into the city to get my next fix. It helped that four were already out when I started). There's plenty of negative stuff you could say about this book - the writing, the characters, the obsession - but again, I couldn't care less :)

Another thing I loved was all the vampire myths Meyer scrapped. These vampires aren't burnt to ash by sunlight: their marble skin glitters as the sunlight is broken into miniscule shards, like diamonds - hence why they are living in Forks, where the sun hardly ever shines. They are not hurt by crucifixes or stakes through the heart. They do not¬†sleep at all, nor do they eat human food. They drive fast cars really really fast. And they can fall in love. Awwww.

Seriously though, this was one of most fun, most enjoyable, most romantic books I've read in a long time, and I'm so happy there are two more out with a fourth on the way. They are, somewhat predictably, making Twilight into a movie - still in the early development stage - but it's rather fun to go to the author's website and see her own preferences for actors to play Edward etc. Can't say I'm familiar with most of them, but her top choice (now sadly too old), is indeed a perfect match. Who knows who they'll really cast, but as with the book, the characters have to be right or the whole story will be just silly and sappy.

109,K.D. Absolutely,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"May 25, 2011",4,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower: A. Free live sex shows but you are not allowed to tell anyone. B. Free LSD mixed in a brownie. C. Free to make out with girls who take fancy on you because you seem to be harmless. D. Free books because you are autistic hence you can finish a challenging book to read like Ayn Rand‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Fountainhead‚Äù in 12 days and your English teacher wants to challenge you by giving you more and more books to read. E. All of the above. F. None of the above. 

 I read this novel twice. The first time I read it, I was annoyed from first page to page 213 and I had no doubt that this book deserved a rating of 1: I did not like it! However, when I went through the existing ratings of my friends, most of the younger ones rated this with either a 5 or 4 and most of the older ones, either 2 or 3. I read their reviews and most of the older ones said something like ‚Äúthe teenagers seem to like this book.‚Äù while the younger ones said something like ‚ÄúI see myself in the Charlie‚Äôs character when I was his age.‚Äù So, I said maybe I should read this again, imagining that I was a 15-y/o man and see if I can relate to Charlie.

That did the trick for me. 

Nope. When I was 15, I did not do drugs because I was still in the island as a 4th year high school student and I was sure there were no drugs in that small town. If there were, I am sure people would first prioritize buying food on the table rather than spend the money on drugs. Since we also did not have maids at home, I was busy with household chores: washing my family‚Äôs clothes every Saturday, ironing our school uniforms every Sunday, washing the dishes every evening (my older sister was in charge of cooking while my oldest brother was in charge of fetching water and the older one for washing dishes every noontime). Nor did I have sex because I was a virgin till I was on my last year in college. Nor did I have friends who made out in front of me because: A. I did not have exhibitionist friends. B. People in the island were conservative on those days so they frowned on homosexuals. I was sure they did their business in complete privacy so nothing like that came out during my time. In fact, during those years, there were only a couple of grownup men who I remember being referred to all so silently as homosexuals. But now, you go there and the homosexuals are all openly roaming the streets at daytime. C. I was a year younger than my classmates-friends and I swear I was clueless at the time they were already talking about finding their underwear wet in front when they woke up one morning or when their hair started to appear down there. 

In other words, I was not able to relate to Charlie but I still liked this book. Reasons: 

A. I dawned on me during my re-read that Charlie is actually addressing those letters to his readers, including me and he is a pure soul. Notice that despite all the sad things that happened to him during his first year in high school and even in the past, he did not bear grudges on anyone. He still see things positively and even wishes good life at all. This is in complete opposite to Holden Caulfield in J. D. Salinger‚Äôs The Catcher in the Rye who is full of teenage angst he calls all grownups ‚Äúphony‚Äù. [BTW, Chbosky in Wiki says that this novel is one of his inspirations in writing ‚ÄúWallflower‚Äù. In fact, this is one of the books, Bill asks Charlie to read.]

B. This reminded me of Mark Haddon‚Äôs The Curious Incident of a Dog at the Night-Time because of its take on autism. Charlie is an autistic child who gets straight A‚Äôs in all his subjects and can finish and appreciate 12 adult modern fiction books most of which have ‚Äúheavy‚Äù themes: To Kill a Mockingbird, This Side of Paradise, Peter Pan, The Great Gatsby, A Separate Peace, The Catcher in the Rye, On the Road, Naked Lunch, Walden, Hamlet, The Stranger and The Fountainhead just during his first year in high school. This is intriguing considering that Charlie‚Äôs style in writing barely changed from his first letter to the last so the learning or insights that he got from the books did not influence him in anyway. He is like a medical case in autism that whatever went inside his head while reading or the events that happened in his life during that year, 1991-1992 did not affect in anyway his outlook in life. He was a pure good soul through and through.

C. Chbosky‚Äôs way of mimicking the sentence construction and grammar of a 15-y/o autistic boy plus the fact that the book is thin and slim encourages the reader to take this lightly, a book that one can breeze through and just say ‚Äúthe teenagers seem to like this book.‚Äù Wrong. Once you close the book, you will feel that there is something in the story that you missed and you will have that impulse to read through again. Chbosky hides his message on the simple and harmless looking letters, Charlie‚Äôs innocence and the unsaid words and untold stories, e.g., What is the significance of his favorite song Asleep by The Smiths in the story? (See the lyrics of the song at the end of this review). What happened to his aunt when she was a young girl? Why did Charlie‚Äôs father slap him? What happened to Charlie in the last letter? Did Patrick ‚ÄúNothing‚Äù love Charlie? Why did not Chbosky give names to Charlie‚Äôs brother and sister? [In the soon-to-be-shown, movie adaptation, there seems to be no football-player older brother but his older sister has a name: Candance.] So, with these questions in mind, I went back to the first page and re-read almost every page except the ones that I found straightforward. I will not tell you my answers to those as that would be too much of spoilers. 

Overall, a very intriguing read. This is the first novel of Peter Chbosky (born 1970), an American novelist, screenwriter and film director. He wrote the screenplay of 2005 film Rent and he was co-creator of 2006 CBS television series, Jericho. So, he and this work, his first, should, in my opinion, not be taken lightly. That‚Äôs my only advice to those who are still to read this book.
 ASLEEP by The Smiths
Sing me to sleep 
Sing me to sleep 
I'm tired and I 
I want to go to bed 

Sing me to sleep 
Sing me to sleep 
And then leave me alone 
Don't try to wake me in the morning 
'Cause I will be gone 
Don't feel bad for me

I will feel so glad to go 


Sing me to sleep 
Sing me to sleep

Following, is the abridged plot summary, as per what all I could gather, post the endearing read, pardon and correct me for any of my follies and errors- 
 
##################################### 

The long-standing brawl between the Capulets and Montagues, the banquet-

The Capulets throw a feast, in which Montagues aren‚Äôt invited, due to the long-standing feud between the two families. The hero of the play, Romeo Montague, pining over Rosaline, dares to masquerade and gate-crash, the banquet, just to catch a glimpse of his searing-love. But destiny has other plans, Romeo loses his heart to the heiress of the Capulet family, Juliet!
Meanwhile in the banquet, Tybalt, nephew to the Lady Capulet, having recognised Romeo, willing to enter into a brawl with him, is dissuaded by Lady Capulet, in order to maintain the decorum of the ball. Juliet has also discovered his identity in the feast, and has been swooned and swept by his charm. Both are head-over-heels for each other by now!

The balcony love-scene üòä-

Forlorn and lovelorn, resorting to her balcony, Juliet confides her affection for Romeo to the moon and the stars(this famous balcony scene is the most-loved!), unaware, Romeo has heard it all underneath the balcony. Ecstatic, by Juliet‚Äôs searing passion, both resolve for a secretive and speedy nuptial the following day. The marriage is brought to pass, in the cell of Friar Laurence, Romeo‚Äôs friend.

The brawl and gory on the street ‚òπ-

On the wedding day, Benvolio and Mercutio, Romeo‚Äôs friends, are accosted by Tybalt, seeking vengeance from Romeo for trespassing the feast. A contention ensues, Romeo lost in marital-bliss, doesn‚Äôt show any interest in the brawl, but Mercutio, all infuriated, takes on Tybalt and is slain! Romeo, now all exasperated, in turn butchers Tybalt. For this act of gory, Romeo is banished by the Prince of Verona. 

Juliet‚Äôs condition ‚òπ-

The bride of one night, Juliet, is left sobbing and dishevelled. Unaware of the secret nuptial rites, Juliet‚Äôs father, resolves to get her married to the kinsman, Paris.

The devastating conspiracy! Devised for the good, but fails miserably ‚òπ-

Friar Laurence, devises a secret plot to help the love-birds unite.(the dramatic failure of the plot, leads to the long-lived tragedy!). He suggests Juliet to drink a potion, which will give her semblance to death, on the day of her marriage to Paris. But Alas! Purporting as dead, she is consigned to the tomb by her father mistakenly. 
Unaware of the plot, Romeo, is all frenzied, frantic, heart-broken, grieved, and rushes to the tomb, having drunk poison, just to lay beside Juliet in the tomb. Upon waking up and discovering, Romeo lying dead beside her, Juliet seizes his dagger, and kills herself.

Reconciliation-

This double tragedy, reconciles the two families, alas, after all the carnage & gory.

Favourite lines from the play-

Defining the bad-luck of the two-
‚ÄúA pair of star-cross 'd lovers take their life‚Äù

Few general ones-
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand

‚ÄúWith tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew. 
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs : 
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun 
Should in the farthest east begin to draw‚Äù

Romeo brooding over the luxury of his sorrow, post which he meets Juliet-
"" Why, then, O brawling love ! O loving hate ! 
O anything, of nothing first create ! 
O heavy lightness ! serious vanity ! 
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms ! 
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health ! ""
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
""Under love's heavy burden do I sink.""
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
""Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.""
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
 ""Thus with a kiss I die.""
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

Upon hearing the sweet Juliet‚Äôs voice in the garden-
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night. 
Like softest music to attending ears !

Juliet‚Äôs expression of love-

My bounty is as boundless as the sea, 
My love as deep ; the more I give to thee, 
The more I have, for both are infinite,
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Good night, good night ! parting is such sweet sorrow 
That I shall say good night till it be morrow
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
""O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon, 
That monthly changes in her circled orb, 
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.""
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

The Prince of Verona-
""For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo."" 
####################################

My views-

It is a play with delineation of all sentiments, from a hideous family feud, a personal vendetta turning into bloodshed, to a torrential love story, and a tragedy of mistakes and a failed plan!

Both Romeo and Juliet, are subjects of a tumultuous youth, living in a warlike hubbub, living a contrasting life, of passion and despair!

Romeo, is a man with good intentions, but all his efforts are forfeited. He is showcased as an epitome of bad-luck/star-crossed. Romeo nurses his love in his heart, and is seen lamenting and foreboding, shedding tears throughout. He isn‚Äôt a mature thinker, and is given into hopelessness on every occasion, soon enough!

Juliet, is a simpleton, na√Øve, true to the core, and is given into poetic imaginations of a tender heart. She thinks aloud in words!

An ardent, unrestrained, tender, young love, nothing is factitious or fallacious about their sovereign love!
I am gob-smacked, how can one write a play with such a purity of heart, dignity of manners, passion in love and violence, in a rhythmic sonnet, in an era, beyond contemplation!! That is what Shakespeare is all about, after all! üòä

This delicate tale of love and misfortune, deserves an endearing 5-star!!!!"

114,Emily,Gone with the Wind,"Aug 04, 2008",1,"I received my copy of Gone With the Wind in 1991 and never got past the first 50 or 100 pages in any of my annual attempts at this books until 2004, at which point I decided to defeat the book one and for all. I FINALLY FINISHED READING THE DAMN BOOK.

I want my time back.

There was a reason I never before read past the first 50 or 100 pages - Scarlet is a raging evil snarky miserable bitch and I hate her. None of the other characters were particularly likable - ranging from sniveling, whiny sissies to evil, snarky assholes. 

I don't care if it *is* some great story about surviving in a war zone or some bullshit line like that. None of these characters really expressed the complexities or debated the moral dilemmas involved in surviving the Civil War. Scarlet was a whiny, conniving miserable human being and I don't give a crap if she ""only did what she had to do as a woman."" She didn't have to treat Ashley or Rhett or ANYONE the way she did, or she could have at least felt bad about it or something. 

I disliked every single character and their miserable lives. I want my time back.

But by God did it feel good when Rhett tells her ""My dear, I don't give a damn"" because neither do I.

(PS: I am, in fact, allowed to dislike this book. You don't need to reply to my review by calling me names. I'm perfectly happy to hear about why you did like it, or why you didn't like it, but I'm tired of people coming to MY review and calling me names because I don't like this ""classic"" book."")

(PPS: This book is also a racist & sexist glorification of a racist & sexist past. It's the literary equivalent of the Confederate Flag.)

Seriously, folks. You can just read this and disagree and then not say a single thing. A for fuck's sake, don't come here and be an asshole to me if you don't like my review. Get the fuck off my lawn.

And don't come here saying I want to ban or burn the book, like Nazis. I don't. You can read whatever you want. I don't believe in banning or burning books. I do believe this book is the Confederate flag of literature."
115,Luffy (Oda's Version),Gone with the Wind,"Jan 17, 2019",5,"Review to come. So far this has been an engrossing read. I remember watching the movie an having mixed feelings about it, but the book has less of those moments when you are kind of exhorting the plot to stop plodding. It really puts into perspective how we are the products of our culture. This is definitely five-star material.

Finished the book finally. What a chunkster! What a story! The words kept coming, and I kept being riveted all the way. A slight complaint is that the main character Scarlet has too much grief to bear, and there's no respite for her. The last chapter took me 10 hours to complete. It was so unrelenting in tension. But people labelling it as a romance is sometimes a disservice. It's so much more. This large but singular book (Margaret Mitchell did not write a Go Set A Watchman) is viscerally yours to enjoy. That's it from me."
116,Justin,Crime and Punishment,"Oct 26, 2009",5,"I read Crime and Punishment severs years ago and immediately rated it 5 stars. Then, I started walking around town telling people it was one of my favorite books ever. People would walk up to me on the street and ask, ‚ÄúHey, Justin, you look like a guy who reads good books. Hey, could you power rank your top five favorite books of all time for me?‚Äù 

That‚Äôs an example of a real life question that no one ever asked me. But, if they did, I was ready to respond!

‚ÄúFahrenheit 451, 1984, Les Miserables, Crime and Punishment, and the fifth one is always changing. Today, I‚Äôll go with The Count of Monte Cristo.‚Äù Then, I have to remind myself I‚Äôve never read the unabridged version of that one, and also the list of books isn‚Äôt really in order. Also, no one is asking me this question anyway. Finally, I‚Äôm never really walking around the town anyway. 

So three years ago I loved this book and a month ago I couldn‚Äôt tell you a thing about it. I knew the main plot, obviously. You know, there‚Äôs a crime and then the next 80 percent of the book is the punishment. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a spoiler. I hope not. So I knew the main plot, but I really couldn‚Äôt remember why I loved the book years ago. It was time to read it again!

I quickly remembered why I loved it. Dostoevsky has his crazy ability to write about the human condition that still feels fresh and riveting over 200 years later. It‚Äôs tedious at times, not always a blast to read, not always fast-paced, but sticking with this book until the end is worth it. The characters are given so much life that even the ones that seem to be minor give you a reason to care when they show up. There aren‚Äôt too many of them and they are all beautifully written, whether you like them or not. And you probably won‚Äôt. 

The translation I read made the book feel like it was written in the 21st century. Sometimes older books like this can be exhausting or written in a way that makes them a chore to attempt to read, but this one is one of the most accessible 19th century books I‚Äôve found. I don‚Äôt read many books that date that far back, but when I do... that‚Äôs stupid. I‚Äôm just trying to say if you want to dabble in classic literature and looking for a place to start, I highly recommend this one. 

Also, if you love nihilism this might be just what you‚Äôre looking for. Great characters. A extremely well written story that dives deep into consequences of our actions and what it‚Äôs like to deal with (or not really deal with) guilt and consequences and remorse. It reaches its climax early, but the rest of the book plows on with much more plot to soak in before it‚Äôs all over. 

And when it‚Äôs over you can walk around town and tell random people who don‚Äôt care how much you love this book. Or come tell me about it. I‚Äôm still trying to find someone to tell about it."
117,Brian,Fahrenheit 451,"Jan 23, 2009",5,"I am in 6th grade. My Language Arts teacher assigns us a book report; tells us we can choose the book but that our grade will be based on the maturity of the novel the report is based upon.

My mother and I are in K-mart. I've mentioned to her about this book report to be done, and so before we leave with a basket filled with clothes I know I will be embarrassed to wear, we stop by the rack of books. She selects a few pulp paperback titles, throws them into the cart.

A few days later she hands me Fahrenheit 451. ""I've read those books I purchased,"" she says. ""I think this is the best of the bunch. You should like it.""

I am skeptical. When does a 12 year-old boy like anything that his mother does? I admit to myself that the cover looks really awesome - a black suited, menacing man shooting flames over something that looks like books. I give it a go.

Tearing through the pages, the chapters, the three sections, I finish it over a weekend and am in awe. A fireman that starts fires? Books are outlawed? I look at the small library that I've had since childhood; a shelf of about 30 books. They now look to my 12 year old eyes as books of a child. Fahrenheit 451 is the book that launched me from childhood, my first book dealing with the adult world.

I ask my mother to box up my old books and put them in the attic. I am proud to start a new library with this novel as my first edition. I carefully, lovingly, sign my name on the inside cover. Let the firemen come, I think, I am proud to be a book-reader.





I continue to read this book again and again through the years. I enroll in a college course at Penn State my freshman year, simply because this book is on the course materials. I memorized the entire poem Dover Beach because it is the selection Bradbury chose to have Montag read aloud to his wife and her friends. As the years roll by, and I age through my 20s and 30s, I noticed that fewer and fewer of the people I know read any books. Even my avid reading friends from childhood moved on to their careers, their marriages, their children. In the late 1990s a friend invited me to his house to show off a proud new purchase - a television screen the size of one of his walls. I mention how frightening this was, that he was basically mainlining Bradbury's foreshadowing. He handed me a beer and fired up Star Wars; told me to relax. I watched the movie and felt like a traitor.

The last time I read F451 was about 10 years ago - I think I was afraid that if I were to pick it up again that it would diminish in its importance to me - much like Catch-22 and The Sun Also Rises. But on this first day in May I have a day-trip to Socal for business and I bring this book with me. And I love it, all over again, as if reading it for the first time. Until Infinite Jest came along, this was my favorite book. I remember why.

I joined Goodreads in 2009 with low expectations. I am not a social media person. I've given up twice on Facebook; the last time for good. But there was something I found here that reminded me of Montag's joining the campfire of fellow readers. We may all be from different walks of life from places all around the world, but we come here often and with excitement - because we love books. They are some of the most important things to us and our lives would be ruined without them.

So to you, my fellow Goodreaders, tonight I raise a glass to each of you, and I want to say thank you thank you thank you for making my life better, for exposing me to authors I would have never known, and for reminding me that although I'll never get to all of the books I want to read in this life, I can stand on the shoulders of you giants and witness more wonders of the written word."
118,Melissa ‚ô• Dog/Wolf Lover ‚ô• Martin,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Nov 03, 2018",5,"This book was wonderful. I absolutely love the movie, which I now need to watch! 



In many ways, this was a sad story for me. I would really like to read a biography of a geisha and watch a documentary to really look into their world. 






We lead our lives like water flowing down a hill, going more or less in one direction until we splash into something that forces us to find a new course.


Happy Reading!

120,Walt,The Book Thief,"Mar 19, 2008",5,"Bravo Zusak! A standing ovation, a mighty opus. You stood Death on her head, removing her dark cloak and scythe, clothing her with feeling and letting us see she has eyes to see and a heart to feel, and the intellect to narrate a compelling story. I was so glad to find out she has a womb. Out of Death comes Life. She has greater aplomb than Nick in telling about Gatsby.

In the spring of 1968 at age 19, I made my way to Dachau. I lived just south of Munich and the visit to the defunct concentration camp had a haunting effect upon me that will last until Death comes for me and, I believe, beyond (but eternity‚Äôs yet another subject; this story was about life.) I went back to Dachau several times, the souls of the living and the dead calling me. As I worked among Germans in nearby Munich, I was surprised to encounter Jews still, or perhaps again, making their home there, so close to Dachau, so soon after Hitler and his henchmen. These early experiences furnished my life with both angst and vision: with angst to recognize the potential for evil within ever human being and with vision to see the possibility for courage and compassion, to pick up a piece of bread to feed a cipher.

And that‚Äôs a big part of what The Book Thief does for me: it captures and again reminds me of these viabilities as they play out near Dachau in the heart of World War II‚Äôs Nazi Germany in the lives of Liesel and her contemporaries, alive and dead. Death tells Liesel‚Äôs tragic yet wonderful story in order to keep memory alive. In the words of Elie Wiesel, ‚ÄúBecause if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices.‚Äù And surely this is Liesel‚Äôs story not Death‚Äôs just as Gatsby's isn‚Äôt Nick‚Äôs. To remind us to stand up wherever tyranny and power put people down.

Zusak took the time and effort to invest the narrative with near perfect words and wonderful sentences and great paragraphs and superb chapters. It would have been too cruel and ironic if the ‚Äúbook thief‚Äù had found herself betrayed by the words, sentences, and paragraphs of her story‚Äôs teller. Flesh fully clothes each character; conflict, action, and suspense oblige the attention of each reader; and the themes are true and consistent throughout, start to finish, and the setting is hauntingly perfect. I hope because of this book I am closer to bending over and picking up some bread to give to a cipher, even if it puts us both at Death‚Äôs door.

It is a mighty work."

122,Carol,Charlotte's Web,"Aug 29, 2012",5,"As I now join the million's of readers who have enjoyed this great book, I realize it truly is a book for ALL ages. Loved every minute of it!"
123,Harold Bloom,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"May 29, 2007",1,"Can 35 Million Book Buyers Be Wrong? Yes.

Taking arms against Harry Potter, at this moment, is to emulate Hamlet taking arms against a sea of troubles. By opposing the sea, you won't end it. The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.

The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review. Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children's list. J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.

Imaginative Vision

I read new children's literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now. I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" purportedly the best of the lot. Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability. It is much better to see the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book's (and its sequels') remarkable success. Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.

The ultimate model for Harry Potter is ""Tom Brown's School Days"" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet. But Hughes' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy. Rowling has taken ""Tom Brown's School Days"" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein. The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.

In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of ""Harry Potter."" But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame's ""The Wind in the Willows"" or the ""Alice"" books of Lewis Carroll. Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all? Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?

Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the ""perfectly normal"" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery. The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught. Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling's version of Tolkein's Gandalf. The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations. (Sex barely enters into Rowling's cosmos, at least in the first volume.)

But I imagine I'll get to it in due course. I just don't see what the rush is."
125,Piyangie,Romeo and Juliet,"Jan 27, 2018",5,"My first reaction when the read was over is why on earth it took me so long to read this beautiful work of Shakespeare having it physically with me all this while. Perhaps, I thought I didn't really need to read it since I know the story from the movie adaptations I have watched. How foolish! I had no idea what I had missed for so long. 

I have never enjoyed Shakespearean writing as much as I did in this play. It is passionate, lyrical, and humorous. It is amazing that you find all these in a tragedy; only a great master can accomplish that feat. The story is both romantic and tragic, as we well know. But what is incredible is that the play is a ""beautiful"" tragedy. 

This is one of the most outstanding plays that I have read. I loved it. I haven't read many Shakespearean tragedies, and in my mind, no tragedy will outmatch the tragic tale of Romeo and Juliet. It certainly will be my favourite Shakespearean tragedy."
126,Guille,Crimen y castigo,"Jan 11, 2022",4,"Si usted tiene la idea de que leer a Dostoyevski es pesado, aburrido o dif√≠cil, veremos si puedo hacer que cambie de idea.

¬´Crimen y castigo¬ª es un entretenido, intenso y dram√°tico follet√≠n protagonizado por un inolvidable personaje objeto de un amplio relato psicol√≥gico y repleto de escenas conmovedoras que se suceden sin pausa, siendo as√≠ una novela con una lectura apasionante en su superficie y extraordinariamente clara en sus profundidades (el ep√≠logo mejor ni mencionarlo). 

Fue publicado por primera vez en 1866 en la revista ¬´El mensajero ruso¬ª en doce entregas y con enorme √©xito, un √©xito que no le ha abandonado hasta nuestros d√≠as ni en cuanto a lectores ni en lo que a estudiosos se refiere, para lo que no es su menor virtud el hecho de que, no s√© si gracias a Fi√≥dor o a su pesar, sea susceptible de varias lecturas filos√≥ficas provenientes de posiciones incluso esencialmente antag√≥nicas y con gran influencia en pensadores y escritores de muy variada condici√≥n.
 ‚ÄúPara vosotros, en todas las circunstancias, lo primero es hacer lo posible para no pareceros al hombre.‚Äù 
El objetivo de Dostoyevski al escribir ¬´Crimen y castigo¬ª fue luchar contra el √©xito que el nihilismo estaba teniendo entre la juventud de su √©poca y sus, para √©l, funestas consecuencias. Para ello, el autor, como en √©l es caracter√≠stico, estructura una historia en torno a unos personajes que encarnan diversas variaciones de ese mal que se impuso combatir. Estos individuos no tienen por qu√© despertarnos antipat√≠a, incluso pueden inspirarnos compasi√≥n y hacernos comprender sus actos sin que por ello los aprobemos. En fin, intenta ser justo en el debate. 

En este caso, los personajes elegidos son cuatro:-Piotr Petr√≥vich Luzhin, un arribista capaz de todo por subir en el escalaf√≥n social sin respeto a nada ni a nadie. Este, obviamente, no es un personaje simp√°tico y su destino en la obra dar√° m√°s de una alegr√≠a al lector.

-Andrei Semenovich, un joven bienintencionado, algo arrogante y no muy inteligente que se encarga de proclamar uno de los principios m√°s importantes y necesarios para el futuro para√≠so socialista, a saber, ‚ÄúTodo lo hace el medio, el hombre en s√≠ no es nada‚Äù, y como no es nada, puede serlo todo, cualquier cosa que nos propongamos. 

-Arcadio Iv√°novich Svidrig√°ilov, un c√≠nico sin escr√∫pulos, un vividor con la inteligencia necesaria para salir indemne de sus delitos y cuya moral se circunscribe a su ego√≠sta placer. 

- Por √∫ltimo, cerrando el cuarteto, el personaje m√°s importante, el imborrable Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, un orgulloso racionalista que intenta probar mediante un crimen su supuesta libertad ilimitada, su pertenencia al selecto grupo de hombres extraordinarios capaces de sobreponerse a s√≠ mismos, de imponer sus reglas, despreciando al amplio ‚Äúhormiguero‚Äù seguidor ciego de la moral imperante. Una persona sensible, generosa y valiente aunque un tanto hura√±a, inteligente pero sin recursos econ√≥micos para proseguir su carrera intelectual que se presum√≠a brillante. Esta es la p√≠ldora nihilista a tragar, una discusi√≥n que puede ser entendida como un cuestionamiento de la moral y as√≠ lo interpretaron muchos existencialistas que admiraron su obra. El az√∫car que envuelve la p√≠ldora para as√≠ mejor tragar est√° compuesto de un poco de novela social, el propio crimen, la consiguiente investigaci√≥n policial a cargo de un precedente del detective Colombo, aquel entra√±able personaje protagonizado por Peter Falk, y, por supuesto, el infierno mental al que se tiene que enfrentar Raskolnikov al descubrir fracasado su experimento. 

En cuanto a los argumentos en contra del demonio nihilista, pr√°cticamente se limita a pregonar las bondades que conlleva la obediencia a la ley natural que el autor, por arte de birlibirloque, hace coincidir palabra por palabra con la ley de Dios. ¬øQu√© Dios? Pues el suyo, naturalmente. ‚ÄúSi alguien me demostrara que Cristo est√° fuera de la verdad, si estuviera positivamente demostrado que la verdad est√° fuera de Cristo, yo preferir√≠a permanecer con Cristo que permanecer con la verdad.‚Äù  Fi√≥dor DostoyevskiSi a√∫n sigue pensando que Dostoyevski es pesado, aburrido o dif√≠cil‚Ä¶ tan amigos que ni comisi√≥n me llevo."

That Tolkien imagined this wonderful world so long ago is amazing! He was ahead of his time in creativity & imagination. Seems to me he paved the way for other writers to embrace & run with their imaginations & creativity & even bogus ideas. My beloved Harry Potter series for example is a definite distant relative to Lord of the Rings. They always compare Harry Potter to the Twilight saga but they aren't similar in the least. It is however evident to me that J.K. Rowling has definitely read, & most definitely enjoyed, LOTR. & since Harry Potter is my favorite series ever I also enjoyed LOTR. I recommend this series to anyone wanting to defy reality for a while & enter a magical world full of brave souls full of heart & wonderful senses of humor that will bring a smile to your face every few pages. I shall now give the movies a chance & see how well they fared in comparison to these wonderful books."

Unfortunately, I just think it is unbelievably boring with a jagged plot that seems interminable. Sure, the language is interesting and the first line is the stuff of University English courses. Sometimes I think books get tagged with the ""classic"" label because some academics read them and didn't understand and so they hailed these books as genius. These same academics then make a sport of looking down their noses at readers who don't like these books for the very same reasons. (If this all sounds too specific, yes I had this conversation with a professor of mine).

I know that other people love this book and more power to them, I've tried to read it all the way through three different times and never made it past 250 pages before I get so bored keeping up with all the births, deaths, magical events and mythical legends. I'll put it this way, I don't like this book for the same reason that I never took up smoking. If I have to force myself to like it, what's the point. When I start coughing and hacking on the first cigarette, that is my body telling me this isn't good for me and I should quit right there. When I start nodding off on the second page of One Hundred Years of Solitude that is my mind trying to tell me I should find a better way to pass my time."

Both have nothing to lose and morals disappear before the desire for immediate self-gratification in all things. And so it is with Dorian Gray. It's a moral story so eventually his evil catches up with him and he dies, as does the criminal. 

Is Oscar Wilde saying that it is man's essential nature, to be so internally psychopathic and selfish that so long as he can keep his reputation he will wreak havoc on people's lives and not care in the process of enriching his own? 

Oscar Wilde was a man who held some very nasty views and only cared when extremely similar ones were turned upon himself. (He was imprisoned for homosexuality, but felt it was ok for Dreyfus to be imprisoned on trumped-up crime of murder but really because he was Jewish. He chose the wrong side on that one and lost even his best friend and was out of step with almost the whole of Britain). I don't like the author, but I do love his prose.

I read this book years ago. But the psychological story of a man's realisation that there are no consequences to his actions, nothing is forbidden, everything is permitted, you never forget."

133,"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies",Twilight ,"Oct 08, 2013",2,"Call me crazy, but Twilight wasn't that bad. Well, sure, it's bad, but it's not 1-star bad. The sequels were atrocious, sure, but the first book wasn't the worst crap I've ever read. 

What I suspect most of us hate about Twilight isn't the book itself, but the legion of rabid, terrifying fangirls. The ones debating on online forums about Team Edward vs. Team Jacob. The ones who will argue that Twilight is the best book ever written. The ones who camp out at Twilight movie premieres 1 month before opening day. The ones who post YouTube videos of themselves sobbing their heart out when Rpattz and Kstew broke up irl. 

I hate the fans. I desperately hate the rabid fangirlzzz. There aren't enough words to describe my loathing of Twitards. The book itself wasn't that bad. 

I've read far worse before. I will read far worse in the future. I've read books that I wish were paper so that I could fling it across the room during a fit of rage. 

I've read books with alpha-douches who have made me use curse words that have made a Navy sailor blush. I've read books where the love interest is as abusive asshole who would think nothing of commenting on his love interest's tits or weight. And these books aren't even new adult. 

I've read books where the main character is a rampant fellow-girl hater and slut shamer. I've read books where the main character is so fucking dumb it makes my teeth hurts. I've read books where the main character seems to be doing her damnedest to remove herself from the human gene pool and it is only by the grace of deus ex fucking machina that she is saved. 

I've read books whose plot makes Game of Thrones seem simple, and not in the ""Wow, that's really complex"" kind of way as it is ""What the actual fuck were you smoking when you wrote this?"" kind of way. 

So in that sense, Twilight is really not that bad. Sure, Bella is dumb and a Mary Sue, but the worst you can say about her is that she is completely colorless and bland, with the personality of a block of tofu. The worst you can say about Edward is that he's a weirdo stalker who likes really young girls despite his age, but man, watching a girl while she sleeps? He's been out-creeped by far worse men. 

So really. I mean it. You may hate Twilight with my blessing, but please don't believe it's the worst example of YA literature out there. Is isn't, by any stretch of the imagination."

So, why does no one really mention that Charlie seems to be a high functioning autistic? I mean, there's a difference between shy or wallflower, and autistic. The way he doesn't understand social norms, his thought process, his actions (and inactions in certain situations), even the awkward ways he expresses his feelings. They all point to someone who sees the world differently than the rest of us.
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm totally misreading what Chbosky was trying to portray. Or maybe Chbosky didn't even realize what he was portraying.
See, I love a mildly autistic kid. I love him a whole hellava lot.
So.
This book touched me in my soft spot.
Honestly? I'm not really sure I can give it an unprejudiced review.

 

Hmmm. Well, the reviews are quite divided between my friends. And even though I loved it, I can see why some of them didn't. 
Charlie's friends?
Sam & Patrick were 20somthing hipsters that do not exist in high school. No, not even seniors who've been through things are that deep, that mature, or that introspective. I'm sorry, but it doesn't happen. You may believe you or your friends were that way. But I challenge anyone who thinks that, to go back and read some of their shitty poetry or obnoxiously angsty diary entries. You thought you were waaay more mature than you really were. 
I swear.
However, it does express how some people remember themselves.
So, there's that.



Some people also have a problem with all of the underage drinking, drug use, and sex. 
Ehhh. Ok, I get why they don't like it, but it happens.
I did all of that when I was in high school.
Although, once again, I wasn't quite as cool or mature about it as these guys. Anyway, if you want to pretend that nobody gets drunk til they turn 21, or gets laid till they turn 18? 
More power to you.
However, it's not only unrealistic, but it has been unrealistic for manymany years. And teenagers (while not suave) aren't stupid. If you want to align yourself with the bury-your-head-in-the-sand groups, then I can almost guarantee they'll think you're stupid, too. 
So, good luck getting them to take your advice seriously!



Ok, last but not least, there's quite a few complaints about how many issues these kids have to deal with. Rape, molestation, suicide, gay bashing, bullying, the list goes on. 
Well, let me think... 
No one I knew killed themselves.

 

I guess I'm biased, but I loved this book. And I loved Charlie.
I just hope my Charlie has the courage to participate in life the way this one did.

This means I already had a take on how things went down at Battle School (and that was from Bean‚Äôs rather than Ender‚Äôs perspective). That said, I wholeheartedly recommend Ender‚Äôs Game not because I think it‚Äôs better than Ender‚Äôs Shadow (I don‚Äôt), but because Ender‚Äôs Saga is fantastic (especially the next two books in the series, Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide). The premise of Ender‚Äôs Game is interesting (training the brightest minds to fight the war against mankind‚Äôs greatest enemy); however, it‚Äôs just as interesting to look at the social and cultural changes on Earth. For that, we have the perspective of Ender‚Äôs two siblings, Peter and Valentine. I think they are sometimes overlooked, but they are great characters. Overall, I found Ender‚Äôs Game to be a fun and entertaining read!"
140,Charlotte May,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Sep 17, 2017",5,"I love Narnia! Of course it's not perfect, but they are such wonderful stories, paving the way for so many other fantasy worlds that followed. Sure they've got the allegorical Christian background, and some of Lewis' wording and phrases wouldn't pass as politically correct now. But if you can look past these small details, Narnia is a truly magical place, the stories iconic, I will never forget them. 

The Magicians Nephew

""By gum,"" said Digory, ""don't I just wish I was big enough to punch your head!""

The creation story of Narnia. Young Polly and Diggory are swept up in the experiments of a magician attempting to find other worlds. In doing so they discover the beginning of Narnia, and so start off the tales. 

The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.

""Course he isn't safe. But he's good. He's the king, I tell you.""

The most well known of the Narnian chronicles. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy discover Narnia through the back of a wardrobe. Their battles with the white witch are legendary. 

The Horse and his Boy

""Do not by any means destroy yourself, for if you live you may yet have good fortune but all the dead are dead alike.""

This one though based when the Pevensie children are still in Narnia the focus is on two young Calormene children, Shasta and Aravis. Having both run away - they seek a better life in Narnia, becoming involved in a battle between the Narnians and the Calormenes. 

Prince Caspian

""But things never happen the same way twice. It has been hard for us all in Narnia before now.""

The Pevensie children return to Narnia after a gap of several hundred years (though to the children only 1 year of our time has passed.) They aid the rightful heir to the throne in his attempts to stop his evil uncle from destroying Narnia. 

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

A swashbuckling tale full of adventures! Only Edmund and Lucy return this time, taking with them their dreadful cousin Eustace. They land on the deck of a ship with Prince Caspian - on a journey to find 7 missing dukes. 

The Silver Chair

""He was not a perfectly enormous giant; that is to say, he was rather taller than an apple tree but nothing like so tall as a telegraph pole.""

Eustace returns with a school friend Jill. To find the missing Prince whose disappearance has led to numerous others going missing in search of him. Their journey takes them to the land of giants and to the world underground. Also the best character - Puddleglum the Marsh Wiggle is in this one. I love him!

The Last Battle

""All worlds draw to an end and that noble death is a treasure which no one is too poor to buy.""

A fantastic conclusion! An evil ape is using trickery and deceit to cause the Narnians to live in fear. This is the battle to end all battles and none will be the same again! 

5 stars! Narnia is a wonderful place with the most incredible cast of characters. Like I said it certainly has flaws but its achievements overcome those big time!

""All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on Earth has read: which goes on for ever: in which every chapter is better than the one before."""
141,Laura,The Time Traveler's Wife,"May 16, 2008",2,"Just because something is popular does not mean it's good. Mass ""taste"" is often incredibly bad. Such is the case with this book, only it's not incredibly bad, just not worth the hours it takes to read it.

It seems like every fiction book I've read in the past couple of years is highly depressing, this one included. My life is full enough of it's own challenges and disappointments that I'd like to read to escape. Yes, if novels are full of heartache and struggle, they are realistic and more accurately reflecting real life. Well, this book is clearly not realistic anyway, and the amount of trauma that happened to Henry went beyond what an average person encounters. I appreciate what Niffenegger was trying to do, and it certainly has it's romanticism, but it was not enjoyable to read. 

At the beginning, I had a hard time getting past the ridiculousness of the time traveling man that is the main premise of the book. I compared it to the annoying, short-lived tv show ""Journeyman"", the (also depressing) movie ""Premonition"", and the time-traveling bits in ""Lost"". To better swallow it, I thought of it as a children's book for adults. So I finally got past the goofiness of time-travelin' Henry. It was interesting how the author put together all the different past and futures. I thought she did a good job with how she chose to order them in the book. Where was the plot though? While this is not a traditional story in its presentation, if you put the different scenes in sequential order it should be. Instead of a story with much of a plot though, it was more like an anthropological ethnographic study of Clare and Henry. One third of the book was just them having sex and making coffee. It read to me as more of a descriptive chronicle than a tale with messages to relay. 

I also thought that Niffenegger never fully developed certain pieces like what happened to Henry's dad after Henry visited him and he was barely holding it together. Later in the book, he comes across as a typical, mostly functioning father, but we don't see how that change occurred. It also isn't clear why Henry likes Gomez. It must be nice for Henry to have a friend who knows his secret, and Gomez does some stuff to help out Henry and Clare, but why the bond? The first time they all have dinner together, Gomez is highly rude to Henry, but then the next time they meet during one of the time travels, they're all buddy-buddy. It's not like Henry's just using him for help; he actually likes him on some emotional level. One would think Gomez being in love with Clare would get in the way of that. 

To wrap this up, I also think the author tries too hard to make Clare and Henry cool: Clare with her dramatic artsiness and Henry with his incredible scope of book knowledge and languages, plus all the stuff about their music tastes. I don't think she does a very good job of showing how Henry goes from being the selfish, lost young jerk to the caring, mature husband. It's supposed to be Clare's influence, but the process is not really shown. There's another huge gap in info that bothers me, but it would be a spoiler. (Hard to believe you could have a spoiler without much plot, but there are a couple pieces that are major events in the book.) 

All in all, interesting concept tying time travel to romance, but with real life being trying enough, I need something more light-hearted."
142,Hailey (Hailey in Bookland),Jane Eyre,"Jul 08, 2013",5,Looooooooove!!!
143,Joe,The Help,"Jul 04, 2010",4,"** spoiler alert **
           I read the first paragraph of The Help, absorbing the words, but suddenly being caught off guard by the dialect. I stopped reading.

I shifted the book in my hands, flipping to the author's biography and photograph on the back of the dust jacket. 

Staring up at me was this: 

[image error]

Oh, sweet Jesus, I thought. An affluent, white Manhattanite. Great. And one who apparently fancies herself a master at Southern Black Vernacular. Even better.

I rolled my eyes and returned to page one, fully prepared to hate every word on every page, beginning with Aibileen's horrifically stereotyped ""voice"" written by this smug White Lady. 

Look, I really don't subscribe to the belief that one must be a part of a culture in order to write effectively (or even stirringly) about or in the voice of that culture. Wally Lamb wrote convincingly as a twin in I Know This Much Is True (and as an identical twin, I can vouch for its authenticity). Nancy Farmer wove African culture beautifully into her science fiction novel The Ear, The Eye, and the Arm. Mark Haddon's Christopher Swinton character is a remarkable sketch of a child with autism. So clearly it can be done. 

But I was not convinced about Stockett.

When Minnie's first chapter hopped along in The Help, I prepared myself for an unconvincing spin on Aibileen's narrative, a pasty twist of the vernacular that had been spewed out in the first paragraph. That is not what I got. Instead, her character was nothing like the other maid; her own voice was rendered in tough, bitter layers, providing a nice foil to Aibileen's complex struggle between resolve and resign. 

NO! my brain screamed. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! DO NOT ENJOY THIS!

But the pages turned, and when I next looked up at the clock, a few hours had passed and I was well on my way to the halfway point. 

Dammit.

And this was the pattern that followed in the 2 1/2 days it took me to read The Help; I found myself loving it and hating it simultaneously, but leaning more to the Love side of the dilemma. There are countless trite episodes in The Help, standard plot fillers that can be found in both heaving Harlequin romances and sucky Oprah Book Club fodder. But there are more moments of striking beauty, humanity, and humor, even if the ending is a bit of a cop-out. (No surprise that The Rich White Lady Saves The Day And Gets What She Wants.)

Is The Help Great Literature? No. Is it a fast and enjoyable read? Yes. It's also a fairly striking and genuine portrait of what life in the south was like during those tumultuous times. And for that... well, for that I quite liked it.

So congratulations, Whitey McWhiterson, I wound up not hating your book. 

And God knows I tried."
144,s.penkevich,1984,"Jul 03, 2023",4,"‚ÄòIf you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face‚Äîfor ever.‚Äô

‚ÄòHistory stopped in 1936,‚Äô George Orwell once said to fellow author Arthur Koestler. During his time in the Spanish Civil War, Orwell observed the pervasiveness of propaganda as a pillar upholding authoritarianism, from censored newspapers to lies perpetuated for political convenience and began to fear that ‚Äòthe very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.‚Äô This fear presented itself across the whole of his works during his short life, culminating in his famous 1984 where he warns ‚Äòwho controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.‚Äô Published in 1949 and written as Orwell was dying from tuberculosis, he didn‚Äôt live long to see how 1984 and his dire warnings against authoritarianism would have a lasting effect even to this day, often being used by all sides of the political spectrum as a cultural touchstone. And while this is mostly owing to the broad criticisms showing how any ideology can become oppressive when hungry for power, it also exemplifies his own dread that words will be twisted and quoted as cudgels to fit a desired purpose as truth is washed away. A harrowing story of dystopia, surveillance, manipulation and resistance being crushed underfoot, 1984 still chills today with its themes on collective vs individual identity under totalitarianism and controlling all aspects of reality to eliminate all those who step outside the boundaries of orthodoxy.

‚ÄòWe know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.‚Äô

When we read sci-fi, words like ‚Äúprophetic‚Äù and ‚Äúwarning‚Äù often get applied. 1984 continues to remain relevant due to its warnings against irresponsible use of rhetoric, which almost makes the references to it amusing or ironic. Such as the Apple computer commercial in 1984 that uses the novel for the sake of marketing (and what is ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù but a euphemism for propaganda) a product that would lead to all sorts of concerns over government surveillance for which people would quote 1984 in addressing them. I think the term prophetic often frames a book in a way that causes us to consider how close it came true, which seems beside the point because when we look at the ways it didn‚Äôt, that often becomes an excuse for delegitimization or ignoring the warning. 

Born Eric Arthur Blair in Bengal in 1903 and passing in 1950, Orwell‚Äôs short life left a lasting legacy from his works like Animal Farm being classroom staples in the US and terms like ‚ÄúOrwellian‚Äù being blithely applied to anything that brushes against government use of technology and surveillance. Hardly a political cycle goes by in the US without 1984 coming up. In the US alone in the past decade we saw it returning to the paperback bestseller list under the Trump administration when the term ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù was being tossed around, and a few years later it was being referenced by the GOP to claim the government was denying an election victory and inventing the January 6th terrorist attack to arrest people. Though with a president making statements like ‚ÄúWhat you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening,‚Äù naturally one is reminded of Orwell writing ‚Äòthe party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,‚Äô and we are reminded of the power of literature and how we often turn to great works for guidance during uncertain times, though often, as Orwell warned, using it as propaganda shorn of context. Orwell did live long enough to see the novel used improperly, having to put out a statement almost immediately for those who wished to use the novel as an example against the British Labor Party. ‚ÄòMy recent novel is NOT an on Socialism or on the British Labor Party (of which I am a supporter),‚Äô he wrote, and an introduction to the book states:
‚Äòevery line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.‚Äô
Which becomes a pretty important distinction, as Orwell believed in better form of governing yet also was suspicious of anyone who would seek out power in order to change it as he writes in the novel ‚Äòwe know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.‚Äô I feel 1984 is best read with an openness to nuance and in good faith, which is often glossed over for the sake of political identifying which is, ironically or not, the exact thing he was warning against. Which is to say, call out problems even if it‚Äôs your own ‚Äúside‚Äù and don‚Äôt create further divide by abusing rhetoric for the sake of scoring quick political points. 

 I think there is a tendency when trying to score quick political points that things need to have some sort of unassailable pure aim to them. 1984 is critical of any regime that seeks to keep power, but narrowing it to a pointed attack against an opponent without seeing how it might apply to your own political ""team"" (US politics is so much cheering for your ""home team"" than actually hashing out politics, especially lately, though I also find the whole ""both sides"" angle to often be used less for establishing nuance than trying to delegitamize any efforts for progress too, but hell who am I to say I'm just as bad as anyone) is more convenient. But even Orwell himself isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúpure‚Äù figure, having been an informant for the British government delivering a list of names of people suspected of communism (the list includes John Steinbeck and many have observed that there is a strong presence of gay people on the list which makes many of Orwell‚Äôs rather homophobic comments seem all the more menacing). He also, as A. E. Dyson observed in his book on Orwell, that he ‚Äòhad a very English dislike of intellectuals, supposing that anyone willing to wear such a label would be diminished or depraved.‚Äô Which is all neither here nor there, but goes to show how one can create a narrative out of anything, and that is what 1984 taps into.

So let‚Äôs move on to the novel and head on down to Room 101. As I said earlier, 1984 can be read as a culmination of a lot of his themes and ideas across his short career. Warning of totalitarianism arrives everywhere with Orwell, such as Burmese Days when he describes the town as ‚Äòa stifling, stultifying world‚Ä¶which every word and every thought is censored,‚Äô not unlike 1984 because ‚Äòfree speech is unthinkable.‚Äô And one can read in Keep the Aspidistra Flying, with Comstock (a name derived from Common and Stock similarly to how the terms in 1984 are often truncated phrases) bemoaning ‚ÄòI‚Äôm dead, You‚Äôre dead. We‚Äôre all dead people in a dead world,‚Äô as a precursor to the pivotal moment when Winston and Jane declare ‚Äòwe‚Äôre dead‚Äô right before being exposed as having been set up. For Orwell, speech and language is very key. Language itself is fallible and can be morphed to meet many purposes‚Äîit‚Äôs the medium of poets for a reason‚Äîand in 1984 Orwell examines how this can be used to negate truth and establish entirely fictional histories that become generally accepted as a means to upholding power.

‚ÄòWar is peace.
Freedom is slavery.
Ignorance is strength.‚Äô

Winston‚Äôs job is to rewrite history to fit the purpose of the party. Within his department we find all sorts of nefarious linguistic play designed to control the masses because it is thought that ‚Äòif thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.‚Äô We can argue that we see this notion reflected in our modern day, where books exposing history that can be seen as a blemish on the US are banned or dismissed as unpatriotic or trying to rewrite history (the irony in the latter is thick) and many have spoken on the suppression of queer books as an effort to erase the language people need to assess their own identities. What Orwell is looking at is the way language and propaganda is used to control. I enjoy the way he makes creative use of language to compile entire terminologies used by Ingsoc (the party in control that is pretty blatantly a nod to Soviet Russia) to create a propagated history that fits whatever they need, even erasing the history of entire wars to portray other countries as allies and erase the recent memory of them as enemies. 
 ‚ÄòEvery record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.‚Äô
To step outside the orthodoxy of the Party‚Äôs version of history is to become an enemy of the Party and society and find yourself ‚Äúvaporized‚Äù and erased from history. ‚ÄòOrthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think,‚Äô Orwell writes, ‚ÄòOrthodoxy is unconsciousness,‚Äô and when the truth we know conflicts with the truth of the Party, it must be edited. ‚ÄòLies,‚Äô writes Rebecca Solnit in her book Orwell's Roses, ‚Äòthe assault on language -- were the necessary foundation for all the other assaults.‚Äô Afterall, ‚Äòthe first victim of war is truth, goes the old saying, and a perpetual war against truth undergirds all authoritarianisms.‚Äô ‚ÄúDoublespeak‚Äù comes into play here, where one can hold conflicting opinions in their mind and just accept them, and the Party finds that fear is a great tool for ensuring willing erasure of truth. ‚ÄòTruth is not a statistic,‚Äô Winston argues, claiming that just because the masses agree doesn‚Äôt make it true, though over the novel we see how the power to rewrite ‚Äútruth‚Äù can potentially eviscerate anyone who says otherwise until it becomes the only known ‚Äútruth.‚Äù Returning to Rebecca Solnit, she observes:
‚ÄòTo be forced to live with the lies of the powerful is to be forced to live with your own lack of power over the narrative, which in the end can mean lack of power over anything at all. Authoritarians see truth and fact and history as a rival system they must defeat.‚Äô
It is in this way the Party keeps people subservient. ‚ÄòA hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance,‚Äô and Winston, upon reading Goldstein‚Äôs book (the book serves as an insert into the narrative that provides a LOT of exposition about the world and its structures as well as being a sort of Marxist-esque handbook, though it only offers the how things came to be and never the why, much to Winston‚Äôs interest), Winston realizes that the proles (the working class) are the possible solution. However he realized the proles can only revolt if they become conscious of their conditions and only can become conscious of their conditions if they revolt (not a far cry from Orwell‚Äôs own statement ‚Äòwe cannot win the war without introducing Socialism, nor establish Socialism without winning the war.‚Äô), and worries this may never happen. There is also the issue that a revolution will only put a new Party in power that will inevitably oppress again, just in different ways. 

 ‚ÄòThe masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.‚Äô

So without giving anything away because this book is full of surprises (though one may guess if they have read We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, which Orwell ‚Äúborrows‚Äù heavily from‚Äîas does Huxley‚Äôs Brave New World‚Äîand still remains my favorite of the three), across this novel we see a spirit of resistance rise and the forces of power come to meet it with a heavy boot and the power of erasure. While much of the novel focuses on the individual versus the collective, the biggest act of betrayal comes at the end in choosing to protect oneself, the individual, and asking for the harm of others in order to enter the ‚Äúprotection‚Äù of the collective Party by erasing any part of oneself outside their orthodoxy. 

Where once was the belief ‚Äòto die hating them, that was freedom,‚Äô we see ‚Äòin the face of pain there are no heroes‚Äô and fear keeps people in line. Reminding the people of the frailty of being an individual drives them towards compliance. Yet, in another way, we see the collective existing because of the desire of individuals to protect themselves at the expense of everyone else: nobody will revolt out of fear for themselves and in doing so allows the oppression of all to continue. I think this is what Ursula K. Le Guin is getting at when her books look at the need to integrate both the individual and collective by refusing easy binaries and hierarchies. She also, especially in The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia argues that history can never become stagnant and that, like Orwell argues, an revolution will try to uphold power and oppress leading to the necessity of another revolution. While Le Guin sees this as the natural course of history (the double meaning of revolution as a revolt and a constant turning cycling through) Orwell sees this as a constant erosion of truth due to the weaponization of language as propaganda that will inevitably erase reality in place of a false, collective reality where truth is sent to the grave.

‚ÄòWe shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.‚Äô

One might find 1984 to be a rather bleak book, but it is also intended as a warning. There are many minor warnings building up to the larger, main point‚Äîsuch as the paperweight symbolizing a past now inaccessible where art could be beautiful for the sake of beauty, as well as symbolizing the frailty of the individual‚Äîand that we must take care to use language responsibly lest we hold the door for open propaganda. We can even do this on an individual level, such as not perpetuating misinformation (funny political memes are easy to share but dilute the severity of problems when we poke fun at, say, the looks or mannerisms of a politician instead of focusing on their policies) and not giving in to easy attacks instead of respecting the nuances. And so that's my rough rant on 1984, a book that lives on for both its relevance and its political convenience and maybe we should all remember that truth is more important than winning an argument or scoring political edgy points. I fail at it too, we all do, but Orwell reminds us to do better.

'A nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting - three hundred million people all with the same face.'"
145,Jarod,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Aug 16, 2007",4,"A mostly well-written, very imaginative, thoroughly enjoyable read. The narration is warm and witty, the protagonists are well developed and likable but not perfect (written perfectly, but with flaws that give the stories depth), and the settings are vivid and fantastic (remember those loony one-footed invisible things that hop around? and the ending, when the boat sails over that undersea city and then into the clouds at the edge of the world?).

I'm always annoyed when people confound the quality of this series as literature with the quality of the worldview it allegedly expounds, as if the literary world is some kind of neo-Stalinist monolith where the only legitimate art is that which edifies us by propounding a correct ethical system. It's just a story, and a good one at that. Furthermore, as an atheist, I think 1) the religious content of the novels is overstated, and 2) even if it isn't, oh fucking well, that doesn't detract from the novels one whit. The books really don't have any more to do with Christianity in particular than does any other story with a character who gives up his life to save others. See Harry Potter 7; see also, religious archetypes in general. 

As for the Calormen, I think it's highly possible that the garb was just supposed to convey the exotic, and this particular nation just happens to be bad in the world of the book. Everything is not a political statement. The good faun from LW&W is not a statement about how pagan nature religions are good; likewise, I just don't see that the bad Calormen are necessarily a statement about how the people who once wore curly-toed shoes in the real world are bad.

In sum, it's a good story, and even if all the criticisms of the book-- it's racist, it's Christian, etc.-- are true, it's still a good story, and if all I ever read were wholesome books explicitly conveying a wonderful worldview, I would be bored as hell."
146,Peep (Pop! Pop!),Divergent ,"Jul 25, 2010",2,"When I was finished this book I could only think of three things: Uwe Boll, Asylum Films, and the Sy-fy Channel. Yes, to me, it was that bad. It has everything that they like: Cold leader who excels at everything, even when she doesn't try. Violence and gore at every turn. Oppressive society. Tattoos. Injuries that come and go as they please. Etc, etc, etc.

Hmmm, where to start?? To start? To start? Haha, ring a bell? It does. It does. It does. I am brave! I am Dauntless! 

Ok, I'll get serious now. Simply put, I did not like this book. I tried to like it. I wanted to give up but kept on reading and really I don't think it was worth it. I see from the ratings that a lot of people liked it but I didn't. The beginning of the book starts off like Matched. It is slow, we are presented with a brother and sister the day before some type of choosing ceremony. 

I did not get the whole Dauntless thing. What was the point of them? Seems like the only thing they did were stunts and have fun. There were no wars, so why all the fighting? We meet some people guarding a fence (that I am still clueless about), but apparently said guard duty is a job that is kind of like punishment. So what did they do?

There was so much senseless violence! And I am not usually one to complain about it but golly (ha, I said golly), at least in the other book it is very necessary for survival. In this one it is just there because I don't know why. 

The Faction world is kind of clear. We don't know a lot of details of the world outside of Chicago. What happened to everything? I still don't have a clear mental picture of that dang Dauntless compound! And like Tris, I too wondered where that train was coming from and going to!

I didn't like Tris in the beginning. I wanted to. I tried to. But she really sounded like a robot! I felt like I was listening to the thoughts of a robot. All she did was tell me her observations in sentence structured like no real human would talk like. I did like the part where she was complimented. And the part where she wasn't sure if she should be jealous or not. I thought her reactions were sweet and it made me grin. She grew on me as the book went on but I did not see us as friends. 

Tris was good at everything she did. It got to the point that her being the best just wasn't even surprising. I mean, I didn't even need details anymore since she always came out on top. 

The romance between her and that boy with the horrible real name (for the book) was unbelievable and forced. It made me feel awkward. Like I'd overstayed my welcome. Like I was too nice to say goodbye and they'd forgotten I was there. That awkward. Personally, I think the relationship needs to be nixed as slapping and cutting each other is not healthy. And not cool, not cool at all!

There is some good though. There isn't really a boring moment in the book. The action is nonstop. Anywho, you should still read it because everyone else liked it and we can compare notes when you're done!

 A few observations:
1. Tattoos heal really fast and don't bother you (unless it's convenient). 

2. Repeating things three times is better than saying it once. That way we can get it.

3. (view spoiler)[Being shot in the arm won't bother you. You can do pretty much anything because the bullet wound only makes you slightly dizzy. You only grimace when you remember. In paranormal books the hot alpha shifter gets shot and cut then wipes off the blood and laughs. Guess what? In this book the human girl gets shot and goes with the flow. I was beginning to think that the author was lying to me. Is reacting considered selfishness in Abnegation? Was she even a human? Or, was she the robot that I suspected?? 

4. Gunshots don't hurt you but it sure as hecky hurts your enemy. Also, it's ridiculous to expect said enemy to walk when he's been shot.

5. For people that have been raised around nothing but selflessness, seeing someone getting a bullet removed from their shoulder, with a knife, is not as bad as you think. It's apparently the same as watching fresh bread being pulled out of the oven. Exactly.

6. Having your mom AND dad being murdered in front of you is no biggie. That's what being Dauntless is about. It's like having your souffle fall. It kind of sucks, but whatevs! 

7. It's totally fine to (in the same conversation) to mention to someone that, ‚Äúwoah, your parents have been murdered‚Äù and in the next few sentences say, ‚Äúthis might be a bad time, but I am in love with you‚Äù. (she didn't think it was a bad time because she loved him in return). 

8. You can murder your friend without a thought, but only slightly disable those you hate because ‚Äì I don't know why. (hide spoiler)]

9. Knife throwing can be mastered in 3 easy steps (I watched Top Shot, it is not that easy!!)

10. Attempted murder is no biggie! It does kind of suck though. 

11. Oh, and murder statistics are counted (0 in the last 16 years) and attempted murders aren't (it's kind of an everyday thing).

12. The mean kids really need to work on the insults! (‚ÄúThere goes your pretty face... Oh, wait. You don't have one!‚Äù - I assure you they are not in 1st grade!)

13. They are serving the best muscle gain food you can buy. You can grow out of your pants in about a week.

14. There are 5 leaders, but only one calls the shots. The others aren't important or they don't care what is going on with their initiates (aka the future of their faction). 

15. I am brave!

16. Divergent means that you're really just better than everyone else! Don't be jealous of the truth!

17. The fear landscape ‚Äì argh!

18. The ‚Äúfinale‚Äù - argh!

https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...

Do you ever love a book so much that it doesn‚Äôt feel like a book? You‚Äôre so immersed and reading is so effortless that you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre reading at all? The characters are real enough to be people, and their problems and happinesses feel like they‚Äôre happening to you?

That was me with this book.

Which is all well and good until it comes down to reviewing it. 

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôm at a loss for words. I‚Äôm saying I have nothing TO say. This is just too damn good.

I didn‚Äôt read this as a kid, or for many years after. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be interested. I had a copy for years with no intention of picking it up, because I am shallow as hell and only bought a copy in the first place because it‚Äôs pretty. (In my defense: look HOW pretty.) Honestly, I can‚Äôt remember why I decided to read it in the first place.

But I am very, very, VERY glad I did.

I love Anne so much. I love Green Gables. I love Diana, I love Matthew and Marilla, later on I love Gilbert (although I don‚Äôt really understand how people love him from this book alone. Not much to see). 

After reading this, I was obligated to chase the high of the reading experience by picking up the next two installments as quickly as possible, and they were just as good. Mostly. But still an unparalleled level of good.

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to carry across here is that somehow this hundred year old children‚Äôs classic about an orphan girl moving to a rural island in Canada was one of the most unputdownable books I‚Äôve ever read.

And also the writing is as pretty as the cover.

Bottom line: I want to live in this book, please and thank you.

149,Nilufer Ozmekik,To Kill a Mockingbird,"May 29, 2021",5,"After watching Friends Reunion, I felt like going back my high school times to revisit my reading list and picked up my one of the all time favorite reads! 

 I am rereading this book at different timelines of my life and I always find something different to like, getting attracted by different details, changing my mind about which character is my favorite. Nope actually last thing is a total lie. I love Jean Louise Scout Finch. Her narration, her growing up, her innocent and curious mind made her reserve a special place on my heart. She‚Äôs the daughter of charismatic, righteous Atticus Finch who is one of the remarkable characters in the literature history, a prominent lawyer defending black man who is accused of raping a white woman which results with townies‚Äô growing hatred against the entire family.

 It‚Äôs a bold, well developed story takes place in Monroeville, Alabama on 1936! A quiet fascinating lesson of civics, lesson of history and lesson of ethics. 

 My fifth time reading goes smoothly and reminding me of how much I loved the story of small town, a country, townies, neighbors, brave criticism of racism. 

 If you prefer audibook option, Sissy Spacek did a hell of a great job! 

Here are my favorite quotes :
‚ÄúBest way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open‚Äù

‚ÄúYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.""

‚ÄúMockingbirds don‚Äôt do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don‚Äôt eat up people‚Äôs gardens, don‚Äôt nest in corn cribs, they don‚Äôt do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a sin to kill a mockingbird.‚Äù

""People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.""

151,Kim,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Mar 11, 2008",5,"Why is it when I pick up  To Kill A Mockingbird , I am instantly visited by a sensory memory: I‚Äôm walking home, leaves litter the ground, crunching under my feet. I smell the smoke of fireplaces and think about hot cider and the wind catches and my breath is taken from me and I bundle my coat tighter against me and lift my head to the sky, no clouds, just a stunning blue that hurts my eyes, another deep breath and I have this feeling that all is okay. 

Why? Why this memory? I mean, this takes place in Alabama and mostly in the summer, well there is that one climatic scene on Halloween, but I bet it‚Äôs still hot enough to melt the balls off a brass monkey. 

It must be the school thing, my daughter just finished reading it, prompting me to give it another go, to fall back into Scout‚Äôs world and pretend to be eight and let life simply be. 

How is that? How can life for Scout be simple? I mean, she lives in the south, during the depression, she has to deal with ignorant schoolteachers and town folk, her ideas of what is right, what is what it should be are laughed at by her schoolmates‚Ä¶ man, and I thought my childhood was rough. 

Still, she lives in this idyllic town, I mean, except for the racism and the creepy neighbors and the whole fact that it‚Äôs, you know, the south‚Ä¶(forgive me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not immune to the downfalls of the north, I mean, we had witches and well, Ted Bundy was born here‚Ä¶) But, there‚Äôs this sense of childlike innocence to this book that makes me believe in humanity‚Ä¶ even in the throes of evil. What am I saying here? I guess, that this is a good pick me up. 

What I also get from this book is that I have severe Daddy issues. I consume Atticus Finch in unnatural ways. He is the ultimate father; he has the perfect response for every situation. He is the transcendent character. My heart melts at each sentence devoted to him and I just about crumble during the courtroom scene. 

Am I gushing? I sure am. I was raised by a man who thought that Budweiser can artwork was the epitome of culture. That drinking a 6-pack was the breakfast of champions. That college was for sissies. He could throw out a racial slur without a single thought, care or worry to who was around. I won't even get into the debates/rantings of a 16 yr old me vs a 42 yr old him... What a role model. 

So, I thank Harper Lee for giving me Atticus. I can cuddle up with my cider and pretend that I‚Äôm basking in his light. I can write this blurb that makes sense to maybe a handful but that is okay, I am approved of and all is good."

I‚Äôm not joking. Excluding the whole History of Middle Earth since I‚Äôve just started to read them, I have finished my re-read of Middle Earth including the appendixes and JIRT was a genius in worldbuilding. Why?


The Red Book of Westmarch


This is the reason the main five works: The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, are basically Tolkien playing historian.

Now, unlike his bestie Clive Staples Lewis, Tolkien was a perfectionist and took his sweet time writing his books. I mean he literally went back and changed the Hobbit so as to match up with what he had planned for Lord of the Rings. He was very aware of this part of his personality and so added a certain aspect to deal with any possible plot-holes (like he perfectionist he was).


Basically

The Red Book of Westmarch was written by Bilbo, Frodo and Sam as a recounting of the events during Bilbo‚Äôs adventures, the War of the Ring and a translation of history.

In Rivendell, Bilbo translated the events of the Silmarillion and possibly got first hand information from people like Glorfindel. But since it was a translation, there is a possibility of Bilbo having mixed up words and meanings, possibly even names. Not to mention biases or mis-remembering from the narration of elves who were alive during that time. 

The Hobbit is a first account narration from Bilbo himself BUT there were earlier editions of the book that had Bilbo and Gollum‚Äôs conversation occur differently . So what does old Rolkien Tolkien do? Says that Frodo and Sam later on learned the truth of what happened and made the necessary changes in their narration of Lord of the Rings. I see what you did there, you sneaky sneaky.

Now to the big daddy itself, The Lord of the Rings. The events are narrated by Frodo and Sam. So how did they know what happened when they separated from the fellowship? They had it told to them of course. So who‚Äôs to say there weren‚Äôt mistakes or exaggerations when telling Frodo and Sam what happened. After the book was finished, it was shared and landed itself in Gondor, where our favourite King resides. The scholars there may have corrected some mistakes made or you know, made a few tweaks to make themselves look better. (Aragorn is literally flawless)

Many corrections and edits are made to our favourite hobbits‚Äô narrations, but as the years go by, copies of the Red Book of Westmarch start disappearing or getting destroyed. Magic has left Middle Earth and as we reach modern (well the 1900s) England, on a walk, Professor Tolkien stumbles upon an old red book in the woods but it is written in a language he can't read. He finally gets an understanding of the language and decides to translate it into English. Kuduk becomes ‚Äòhobbits‚Äô and Maura, Ban, Razar, and Kali become Sam, Frodo, Merry and Pippin (I laughed so hard when I read this) and other words into digestible words in English. Then tragically, the Red Book is destroyed in a fire that starts in his office and all that remains is a charred piece of paper which Tolkien sends to his publisher.

Lord of the Rings is a translation of a translation, of a translation, of a translation and that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs multiple different accounts of events. Canon could be anything, we don‚Äôt know which specifically.

So basically, the books are based on real life events‚Ä¶

Genius!

Now, that‚Äôs how you do world building... or write a history book...or fanfiction."
154,Stephen,Crime and Punishment,"Aug 20, 2008",5,"6.0 Stars. One of my All Time Favorite novels. In addition to being one of the first works of Classic Literature that I suggest when asked for recommendations from others, this story holds a special place in my heart as it was the story, along with Moby Dick, that began my love of the ‚Äúclassics‚Äù for which I will always be grateful. So often we are forced to read the great works of literature for school or at times not of our choosing and I think it tends to lead to a lifelong aversion to them...like being forced to eat vegetables as a child...yuck.
 
I was fortunate enough to come back to these stories on my own terms while I was in College. My parents, at my request, bought me a subscription to several Easton Press library collections including the ‚Äú100 Greatest Books Ever Written‚Äù and ‚ÄúBooks That Changed the World.‚Äù Two of the first three books I received were Moby Dick and Crime and Punishment. 

So I took a weekend off from getting drunk and running naked through Downtown San Diego and decided instead to get drunk in my apartment and read Crime and Punishment‚Ä¶.and I fell head over heals in man-love with Dostoyevsky. I loved this book from the opening scene in which Raskolnikov is convincing himself about the rightness of committing the murder of the money-lending pawn-broker all the way through the bittersweet end and the beginning of his redemption. 

Powerful, brilliant, insightful and surprisingly engaging despite the fact that it is far from being a ""light"" read in either prose or content. The central theme of this story is not really the crime (i.e. Murder) or punishment (i.e., incarceration) in the formal sense of the word. The real crime is Raskolnikov‚Äôs arrogance in placing himself above his fellow man and thus is not bound by the rules of society (i.e., his belief he is like Napoleon). Likewise, the punishment is the deeply felt, and unexpected from his standpoint, guilt over what he has done. 

It is Raskolnikov‚Äôs personal, internal struggle with the evil he has perpetrated. His mind, his body, his very essence rails against his actions and leads him down the path that will eventually lead to the possibility of redemption. It is such a deeply personal, emotionally evocative journey that it was impossible for me not to become intensely invested in the story. 

Something that struck me as I was reading about Raskolnikov‚Äôs struggle with his conscience was the thought that everybody does things that they are ashamed of or wish they could change. That is part of being human. It is our ability to feel genuine remorse over our bad actions and voluntarily take steps to rectify those mistakes that leads to growth and character. I think this is why I have always loved stories of redemption because it is such a classic theme of being human. 

On the other hand, I also realized why I get so bat shit crazy with anger when I hear of certain kinds of what people terms ""non violent"" crime. Rapists and murderers when they get caught are punished and sent to places I have nightmares about. Whether or not it is enough, we can debate, but it is defintely not a fun place. 

What bothers me are the slime balls who steal and pillage millions and billions of $$$ from people who need it and end up spending time in cushy federal prisons with cable TV and other amenities. I see these ""crimes"" as bad as most violent crimes because they lead to real severe pain and devastation for many of the victims and yet the punishment never seems commensurate. And yet, these ‚Äúwhite collar‚Äù criminals get off so much easier and you NEVER (or rarely) see genuine remorse over the destruction they have caused. It lead me to do a little justice fantasizing and I came up with this that I thought I would share...




Sorry for the less smooth segue, but it was something that came to me while I was reading the book. Anyway, unlike those above, Raskolnikov‚Äôs story is one of true growth and redemption and is definitely a story that I think everyone should read. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!

P.S. The second time I ‚Äúread‚Äù this I listened to the unabridged audio as read by George Guidall and he did his usual AMAZING job. I think his narration is superb and truly enhanced the experience of the story."

156,Federico DN,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Jan 09, 2019",3,"An evil darkness consuming the universe, and three little children determined to stop it.  

In a little cozy home, in the midst of a lovely gardened area, lives the Murry family. A scientist mother, a distant father on a secret mission, two overprotective twins, the little and enigmatic Charles Wallace, and the ever troublesome Meg.

A storm presages the dangers to come. The Darkness, the evil Black Thing threatens to swallow the Earth and everyone in it, among other worlds and universes already corrupted by its malevolent presence. Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin, a fellow schoolmate, embark on a desperate mission through several worlds to try to find their lost father, and, maybe, just maybe, save a small part of the universe.

An enjoyable read, simple, endearing, and weird! Not exactly recommendable, but good enough to hold interest. The first of five moderately short books.

157,Reading_ Tamishly,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"May 24, 2021",5,"I need a Babel fish and make it translate my mind.

""Whatever happened to my mind, I did it.""

.
.
.

""This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.""

Story: Earth is demolished. A man is secretly taken to another planet. So enjoy I say.

It's filled with weirdos because most of them are beings from somewhere else (to keep it subtle or to make it worse) and the story is chaotic and funny as heck.

But really though, reading this series talking about demolishing the Earth during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic did made me question my choice of books.

(And every book I pick up these days are either too depressing or stressed the heck out of me. I question my choices. Yes, I do that a lot these days.)

I was going crazy trying to calm down and understand what was going on in the first few chapters. But then chapter 6 started and there's no going back. Of course, we gotta read the first 5 chapters to get this feeling.

I love this chapter! Funny yet the discussion going on in there. Fun! Faith vs Man.

My favourite character would be Ford. He would be someone I would want to punch in the face but cannot survive without.

Arthur. Oh Arthur. You remind me of us humans that I keep getting all the second-hand embarassment whenever you appear.

Trillian. The way her character is reminds me of some of the most calmest yet intriguing people. I like how her vibes scream sarcasm towards Gaphod, the semi-cousin of Ford.

And what the hell is wrong with Grunthos (yes, that's a real fictional character's name... Real and fictional.) Torture yourself with the poems by Poet Master Grunthos. (My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles....yes, get the hint.) The horror! I cried laughing there!

And you will meet a few more characters. Almost philosophical ones I would say.

Marvin, you will be remembered.

The more pages you turn, the more you will enjoy the story. There's nothing normal here. Because, of course, it didn't happen on our planet. Let your imagination have its exercise and be tickled with an imaginary world somewhere out there.

The entire read reminds me so much of the nerds Sheldon Cooper, Lennerd, Howard and Raj. Like they have written a story together finally!

(The irony though that the book series happened years before the show.)

Another story there, Magrathea. It could happen. Myth?

Love the space time I had with the first book!

Parts like this out of nowhere got me laughing out loud
(""Ah...! What's happening?it thought.

Er, excuse me, who am I?

Hello?

Why am I here? What's my purpose in life?

What do you mean by who am I?"")

Of course, it's not always about the human and humanlike beings here.
I just wish no fictional animal was harmed in the story.

The end of chapter 21 made me quite emotional. I wish I never have to say such lines. Ever.

And (bam!) the chapters that followed this until the end made this read a perfect read for me. I am telling you this is the kind of book the more pages you read the more you get invested.

I kept telling myself ""this is so chaotic"", ""do I need to be worried about how worried I am now while reading this crazy story?"" and ""I want to go there"". Actually the whole story felt rather claustrophobic too.

I really love the last few chapters more. It's everything you need to think about you, the world you live in and what might be actually happening as opposed to what we are made to believe all our lives.

And human, be very scared of mice. (Now I know why we go crazy sht seeing mice!)

""Resistance is useless.""
üëâ Just pick up this book. It's funny at first but then you will know it ain't so funny."
158,Shelby *trains flying monkeys*,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Dec 09, 2013",4,"I read this book back when it first came out. I never wrote a review of it because when I first joined GR I didn't really know what it was all about. It took a bit before it sunk in for me.

Now GR members get spammed at times. The newest form of spam is review bumping. I didn't even know that existed because..well I'm a slow learner. I kept noticing the same person's reviews on my thread. Several times a day. All day. For weeks. Someone finally pointed out to me that they are bumping their reviews. Then I saw several status updates from people posting about how it was driving them bonkers. 

Now my friend Kat decided to take a stand..she made a awesome little badge to show we are all fabulous..not just the top reviewers, and my friend Kelly has a great idea..we are gonna spread some love. Everyone on GR is Goodreads Fabulous.

Here's my friend Argona's review for this book. Her's is much better than anything I could have written..Go show her some love.
Argona..you are Goodreads Famous baby!"
159,Celeste,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Jan 13, 2015",5,"Full review now posted!

Some books define different aspects and periods of your life. Ender‚Äôs Game for me represents the loneliness of childhood when you‚Äôre different. I first read this book when I was 9 years old and just starting the 4th grade. I was the only kid in my small class in the Gifted program at that point, which set me apart. I was an odd child, athletically challenged and socially inept and physically awkward. I had teeth too big for my head, ears too far large for my face, and hair that pencils could get lost in. My only true friends at this stage in my life were family members and books. 

‚ÄúBecause never in my entire childhood did I feel like a child. I felt like a person all along‚Äïthe same person that I am today.‚Äù

So when I came across Ender‚Äôs Shadow and Ender‚Äôs Game, I felt understood (by someone unrelated to me) for the first time in my life. Here were kids who were different, who were often hated and belittled by other children because of those differences, but who discovered that those differences were actually their strengths. That was an incredibly inspirational possibility that I clung to for years after reading the books for the first time, and that I still cling to when I feel like I don‚Äôt fit in somewhere.

‚ÄúI think it's impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves.‚Äù

My copy of this book is tattered. Pieces of the cover are missing. The spine is broken. The pages are yellow. And I won‚Äôt trade it for a newer copy until it falls completely to pieces. I just read this book for the 8th time. I read it in elementary and junior high and high school, once every couple of years, just to remind myself that what made me weird could make me strong. I read it in college when I got married younger than most people and wasn‚Äôt living on campus, and was viewed as an odd duck by my classmates. I pushed it into the hands of kids I could see myself in when I became a teacher. 

‚ÄúHumanity does not ask us to be happy. It merely asks us to be brilliant on its behalf.‚Äù

I lead a small monthly bookclub for teenagers at my local library, and was thrilled when they chose Ender‚Äôs Game as October‚Äôs book. I hadn‚Äôt read it in about five years, so I was a bit nervous that it wouldn‚Äôt hold up to yet another reread, but I dove in anyway. Never have I been happier to be wrong. This book packs just as much punch for me 19 years later as it did the first time I cracked it open. 

‚ÄúPerhaps it's impossible to wear an identity without becoming what you pretend to be.‚Äù

Ender Wiggin is a genius, wise beyond his years, and he is thrust into impossible situation after impossible situation. Adults are the enemy, seeking to isolate him and push him to his breaking point. But he will not be broken. He adapts and overcomes, making friends in spite of the establishment‚Äôs best efforts. However, a time comes when he has to put the mission above his relationships, and has to stand alone. His empathy and drive and monstrous intellect are awe-inspiring, but are they enough to keep him from finally shattering beneath a weight too large for his small shoulders to bear?

‚ÄúThere are times when the world is rearranging itself, and at times like that, the right words can change the world.‚Äù

This is not a children‚Äôs book, but never in my childhood did I read another book that I related to more than this one and Ender‚Äôs Shadow. I honestly feel that this book is appropriate for all ages. If you know anyone who is different, who just can‚Äôt seem to become part of the crowd and always seems to stand out and stand alone, please find a way to get this book into their hands. Be they child or adult, this book will make them feel less alone. And if you yourself are different, if you march to the beat of your own drum even when the world demands your silence, read this book and feel understood.

Original review can be found at Booknest."
160,Amy,The Secret Garden,"Feb 21, 2008",3,"I guess I didn't miss much by not reading this book as a child. I don't really understand why it became a classic. It starts out interestingly enough with a very gothic setting. A little British girl named Mary survives a cholera epidemic in India and is sent to Yorkshire to live with her distant relatives. The author gives a vivid description of the beauty of the moors and the mysterious mansion that the girl goes to live in. The only other interesting part is really when Mary discovers the boy who she hears crying in the mansion and when she discovers the secret garden. Everything else beyond that (which is most of the book) isn't all that interesting. The author spends many pages explaining how miraculous and magic fresh air is for healing and fattening up the crying boy and the girl who escaped the cholera epidemic in India. 

The bits that get old after a while: Oh, look, it's a garden! Look, I can run and play! I'm not a cripple after all! Look at the pretty birds! The garden is alive! Now I have an appetite! Isn't it a magical miracle that I'm having fun playing outside?

I just wasn't really impressed."

162,Henry Avila,Wuthering Heights,"Oct 18, 2012",5,"Cathy and Heathcliff, a love story? At the beginning of our narrative Mr.Lockwood a tenant of Thrushcross Grange, visits his landlord Mr.Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights, four long miles away across the cold, eerie, moors, people back then walked a great distance they had few options without much complaining, troubled Lockwood wants to get away from society (he came to the right place). The setting is northern England 1801, in the Yorkshire Moors a vast, remote, desolate and gloomy grassland beautiful and ugly at the same time, a haunting locale. Lockwood is the only person who likes Heathcliff "" a capital fellow"" in the area, he sees something no one else does on his mournful face, sadness maybe even regret ( like himself) ? Later he learns the story of his landlord's tragic life, through Mrs.Nelly Dean his servant at Thrushcross Grange for three generations , she tells him about the life of Heathcliff found in the streets of Liverpool hungry , crying, dirty all alone without anyone caring there at the tender age of two, but the compassionate Mr.Earnshaw a wealthy man , Catherine's (Cathy's) father and takes him home. They never discovered the boy's true identity but because of the child's dark complexion, everyone calls him a gypsy. The two, Catherine and Heathcliff, grow up as brother and sister at Wuthering Heights always together Cathy and the unwanted orphan, playing on the lonely moors, they are soulmates . Resented by Cathy's older brother Hindley, (who beats him many times) in fact everyone does, still the gentle Mr.Earnshaw loves the boy. Morose, showing no emotions he can't afford to, still very angry underneath because of how others treat him, as an inferior, Heathcliff was never given another name. When teenager Cathy decides to marry Edgar Linton from a respected well off family and Heathcliff hears about it , he disappears to parts unknown the penniless man feels betrayed....Years pass and Heathcliff comes back from America rich, nobody learns how and he doesn't say either, probably not quite honestly and seeks vengeance. The children of each estate the Linton's of Thrushcross Grange and the Earnshaw's of Wuthering Heights, inherit their respective homes, Cathy wants to maintain a friendship and maybe more with Heathcliff, the weak Edgar of course hates the gypsy yet can't stop the two from seeing each other, the attraction is too powerful. The triangle will soon dissolve, people come and go but the moors abide. Strong novel with a bittersweet plot... Love or despise this classic, you cannot help but admire its quality."

164,Lisa of Troy,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Jul 21, 2022",5,"In Orson Scott Card‚Äôs science-fiction novel Ender‚Äôs Game, we meet Ender Wiggins, a talented little boy who has the fate of the world on his shoulders. 

After an extensive period of monitoring, Ender attends a school for gifted children, training to learn the techniques to battle the buggers, an alien lifeform.

When I started my career, I worked at an automotive company where I can only describe the environment as ideal. Our leader, we will call him King Arthur, was always looking out for his team. If you were only there for two weeks, he would come by your desk and let you know he thought of you for this amazing assignment. 

When lunch came around, the entire group would make eye contact and go down to lunch together. No one forced us. We genuinely enjoyed each other‚Äôs company. In fact, one gentleman even won the lottery and came back to work! 

Now, a few years later, I returned to work for this company. King Arthur had retired, and in his place was The Witch. The Witch required that you worked until 4 am. She would not work during the day (instead went to the gym) so she worked late at night, expecting everyone else to work the day and night. She would call meetings and then just never show up for them, wasting an entire roomful of people‚Äôs time without so much as an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù 

If anything was wrong, The Witch would blame you. If the work product was great, The Witch took the credit for herself.

So what makes these leaders? Open Ender‚Äôs Game.

The brilliance of Ender‚Äôs Game is not necessarily the plot but the emotional intelligence and the symbolism. If you have worked in Corporate America, you know that life isn‚Äôt always fair. Some people are out to get you. But what can you say to motivate your team? Does your team need breaks to thrive? Open Ender‚Äôs Game.

This book also brilliantly captured what it is like being at the top. Do you feel like quitting at times? You bet. Are things changing rapidly? Certainly. 

And Ender‚Äôs Game depicts how the most talented are also working harder than most. When Ender had secret techniques, he ‚Äútold them freely, confident that few of them would know how to train their soldiers and toon leaders to duplicate what his could do.‚Äù

Last, but certainly not least, the science fiction aspect of this book is a little unsettling. Portions of Ender‚Äôs Game were initially published in 1977. In the book, Ender and his team have a messaging system that sounds incredibly similar to today‚Äôs email or Team messaging. 

Overall, this book is well worth the read. I would say that it felt like a mashup of Dune and Ready Player One. Highly recommend.

165,Matthew,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Aug 27, 2018",4,"This one is going to be a bit difficult for me to review. I enjoyed it, but it was kinda weird. It was interesting, but kind of slow. The historical fiction aspect is interesting, but I have seen many reviews critical of the actual truth of it all. 

The pros:
- Very good storytelling - Each chapter was its own short story and I found it easy to read and stay interested.
- Characters - I was invested in the characters. In fact, I was so invested I could feel my loathing for one of the bad characters curdling in my very soul. It's usually a good sign when you want to reach into the book and smack a character.
- The setting and the history - it was fascinating to learn about Geisha culture in pre-WWII Japan and how different it is from anything in American history.

The Cons
- This one may not be fair because it is probably historically accurate, but the Geisha culture made all the male characters seem like creepers. So, even when there is one you are supposed to like or who is supposed to be a hero, you know that he is all about pre-pubescent, up-and-coming Geisha and hoping to be able to deflower as many as possible. Just skews things a bit.
- Kind of slow - even thought I thought the storytelling was great, there were a few times where it started to drag and I was ready to move on to the next part of the story.
- Accuracy - Without Goodreads, I would have probably never have known this, but it seems there is some question as to the accuracy of the account in this book. Often, other, more reliable titles are suggested. But, was this supposed to be a non-fiction memoir, a story based on some facts surrounding the Geisha culture but equal parts fact and fiction, or just a completely made up story? I am not completely sure, but it should provide some interesting follow up research.

So, I am going to go with 4 stars because it was an interesting story and despite some slow spots and creepers, it was pretty entertaining. Also, questions/controversy over its accuracy might actually raise the entertainment value!"
166,Margaret M - (Working Away - limited time with lots to catch up already,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Jan 29, 2022",5,"‚ÄúLearn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that points north, a man‚Äôs accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. You remember that, Mariam.‚Äù

Five heart-breaking and tearful stars for a story that will stay with me for a long time, 5 glorious stars for a book that dares highlight atrocities committed against women in Afghanistan, and 5 flawless stars for a book that is pretty dam perfect in everyway possible. Inspired by real and common events these fictional stories need to be told to draw attention to the treatment of women (and men). High praise for an author who brought this story to the world along with his own personal reflection. Mesmerising, absorbing, but shocking. 

The Plot 

Mariam, the unwanted child of Jalil, lives with her Grandmother until her death and is then sent to live with her natural father and his many wives and children. Rejected and spurned from this new family, at fifteen, she is betrothed to marry a man many years her senior, Rasheed a business associate of her father. As she parts ways there are some chilling exchanges between father and daughter.

‚ÄúI thought about you all the time. I used to pray that you‚Äôd live to be a hundred years old. I didn‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt know that you were ashamed of me.‚Äù, but his reply ‚ÄúIt ends here for you and me. Say your good-byes.‚Äù

Having miscarried multiple time Madiam finds herself in the company of Laila, her husband‚Äôs second wife, a women he has chosen to provide him with the family he craves. Yet there are no protestations of love for either women and as a bully, an abuser and violent man he hides behind his status in society to inflict unimaginable mental and physical cruelty on his wives. In a society that offers them no protection and importantly no voice, they decide to take matters into their own hands, and either escape from Rasheed or kill him, and as such they make a decision that neither women will regret but one that will have devastating consequences.

‚ÄúOne could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.‚Äù, because to live with their husband was to not live at all. 

Review and Comments

A Thousand Splendid Suns was a brilliant but heart-breaking story, the writing was stunning, and the plot treat was inspired by true events was fantastic. The characterisation although fictional was believable and authentic. However, it was the inspiration and knowledge that the mistreatment of women is commonplace is what made this such a tearful read. 

Women in many societies accept and even embrace the only environment they know. Some, are even happy in it, and it is not for us to judge any society to say what is right. Except this, if women do want a voice, the freedom to work and be educated, then society should consider to not do so is suppressive, suffocating and sometimes brutal. And so, applause for Khaled Hosseini who has given them a voice through his story and an in insight into a life that is all too real for many women. 

A letter of regret that Miraim never got to read speaks of her father‚Äôs regret ‚ÄúMay God grant you a long and prosperous life, my daughter. May God give you many healthy and beautiful children. May you find the happiness, peace, and acceptance that I did not give you. Be well. I leave you in the loving hands of God. Your undeserving father, Jalil‚Äù

A sensational and stunning book with epic qualities, a powerful and heart-breaking story, and a reflection from the author ‚Äú. to see women, we must look at the humanity beneath the veils‚Äù and for me, also in the hearts of those women who are dispossessed of their greatest needs."
167,Anne,Jane Eyre,"Jan 19, 2009",2,"Whew! I finished this one this morning, and I'm glad I finally read it. I can't say, however, that I enjoyed it, would recommend it, or will ever read it again.
Not in this lifetime, anyway. 

 

For starters, I didn't like Jane. Yeah, when she was a kid I felt sorry for her, but the older she got the less I liked her. Her religious convictions and the decisions she made because of them had Bertha looking like the picture of sanity by comparison. Speaking of, why in the world did she wander off in the middle of the night with no money?
What did she think would happen? Was manna supposed to drop out of heaven? 
And I don't buy that an educated, sensible woman would just run off into the night without taking enough with her to make sure she could survive. An idiot would have better sense than that.
But by the end of the story, I was almost wishing she had wandered off after St John and contracted some disease. The fact that she didn't totally realize what an awful freak St John was nailed the lid on her coffin to me. Even at the very end of the book, she kept talking about all of the great works he was doing for God. 

 

Seriously? 
He was an ass, and I would have told him to give me my five thousand pounds back! 
At least Bronte had the sense to kill him off at the end. Well, maybe he wasn't quite dead yet, but he was on his way to meet his maker. Ugh.
I also thought it was more than just a teeny bit fishy that she ended up on the doorstep of the only family she had in the entire world. 
Exactly how likely is that? Not very.

  

Then there is the man himself, Mr. Rochester. He wasn't anything to write home about for sure. Let's start with the obvious, shall we? He was cold, condescending, secretive. Wow. 
Oh yeah, and he was ugly to boot. Yum.
 


Can anything else be said about him to make him more of a catch? I know! Just in case, let's have him keep a drooling homicidal wife hidden away in the attic! 
Personally, I think Bronte had covered all the bases at this point.
Did he honestly not see anything wrong with letting her marry him while he had that crazy bat of a wife locked upstairs? If he had just told her the situation to start with, I might have liked him a little better. 
Nah. Probably not. I never actually figured out what she saw in him. My best guess ended up being low self-esteem coupled with a bad childhood.

 

The 'gothic mystery' part of the plot ended in the middle of the book, and shortly thereafter ended anything remotely interesting. Say what you will about Looney Bertha, but at least she pumped some life into the story.



And wasn't it just awesome that Bertha burned the house to the ground and then leaped to her death? Nice exit big girl! I gotta say, she was by far my favorite. Lest we forget, she also managed to mangle Rochester's good looks even more before she bowed out. Now Jane's man looks like a one-eyed, one-armed, flying purple people eater. Of course, she doesn't mind, because now she feels she can be of use to him.
 


Jane, I can tell we will never see eye-to-eye on things, so I'll just let it go. Our friendship was never meant to be. For some, you will forever remain the stoic heroine who finally gets her Happily Ever After. For me, you are just a ninny with bad taste in men. As Adele would say, Adieu. 
Reader, this review is over."
168,Stephen,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Feb 16, 2009",3,"On my list of reasons why my daughters are the bestest thing to ever happen to me, Number 14,577 is that they gave me, at 41 years old, the perfect excuse to revisit the Harry Potter series. 

When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books, I couldn‚Äôt have been happier. As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room, I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang, and I realized that I‚Äôd never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume. I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight.

Harry deserves it. 

However, with over a million ratings, and almost two reviews for every day I‚Äôve been alive, I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles. It has all been eloquently said before. Therefore, I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series, and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people. 

Here goes...

Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings. One that can hold at bay, even if only for precious moments, the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life. These stories do that. 

It‚Äôs an escape into a world of optimism, honor, and hope, where things always look hopeful and anything is possible. Who wouldn't want to hang around in a place like that, especially when it is decorated with sorting hats, kindly giants, magic wands and Quidditch.

Granted...no aspect of the story is revolutionary, or even particularly noteworthy, from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre. It isn‚Äôt great literature, and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success. 

Fine...acknowledged. And? So what!

The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers. Harry‚Äôs story is something that radiates acceptance, inclusion, and friendship. It invokes a sense of belonging. Inside these pages, you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanity‚Äôs nature, and feel just a little better about the world around you.

How is that not worthy of praise?

As for Harry himself, he‚Äôs just a good kid. The quintessential everyman who makes good. A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him. He‚Äôs someone you can‚Äôt help but like. 

He‚Äôs not perfect. He makes mistakes, he‚Äôs occasionally short sighted, and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more. Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet, or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas. 

But that‚Äôs not Harry. He‚Äôs a better person than that. That‚Äôs why we love him. 

Maybe all of the above is a bit much. Like I said, I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me. Let‚Äôs just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy. 

I‚Äôll certainly settle for that. 

As for the rating, I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars, and I‚Äôm not going to change that now. As much as I love the series as a whole, I don‚Äôt think it reaches stratospheric heights until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. 

Still, this is where it all began. As such, it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better.

3.0 stars. Highly Recommended."
169,Rachel  L,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass,"Jan 02, 2023",3,"3 stars 



If you‚Äôve been following me on Goodreads, you know I have a tradition of reading a classic novel at the beginning of every new year. I always want to read more classics, and never do, so this is one of the few ways I can read more. I adore the Disney movie Alice in Wonderland, and have owned the book for years, but never read it. 

Well‚Ä¶ this book really was like reading a fever dream. Not much of it really made sense to me and everything changed so fluidly, as if you were in a dream. It‚Äôs easy to get sucked into the story and Carroll does have a very inventive mind. But I think this is one of those books where the legacy it created is better than the original (please don‚Äôt shoot me anyone). I love the pictures included and will always be a fan of Alice in Wonderland, but not sure I will read anything else by Lewis Caroll."
170,Mary,Twilight ,"Jun 07, 2008",1,"Twilight is lame and stupid.

I think everyone knows that the characters are essentially the ones who make up the book. It‚Äôs through them that the plot is developed, the conflicts are carried, the climax is revealed, stuff like that. And when you‚Äôre writing in a first person POV, you have to make that ‚Äúfirst person‚Äù interesting and observant. Bella, our first person, is about as interesting as a rock. 

Isabella is nothing more than a Mary Sue. It doesn‚Äôt even take a genius to figure out that ‚ÄòBella‚Äô is Italian for ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô. And her last name is ‚ÄòSwan‚Äô, which as a device in literature, symbolizes grace and beauty. Bella Swan? Beautiful Swan? Not very clever.

Here‚Äôs the contradiction: She‚Äôs ordinary. At least that‚Äôs what she keeps on insisting throughout the book. Practically everyone in her new school asks her to the dance, or to the prom. And she gets the guy who apparently ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt date‚Äù because ‚Äúnone of the girls‚Ä¶ are good-looking enough for him.‚Äù Her appearance is somewhat similar to the author‚Äôs, as well as her story of moving to a new place. If it helps, she‚Äôs a klutz ‚Äì a last ditching effort to not make her a complete Mary Sue.

Most readers who like Twilight relate to Bella. Well I don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt possibly relate to a young woman with no plans, no goals, no solid interests, no personality, no deep observations of life, no nothing - but is just ‚Äúunconditionally and irrevocably in love with‚Äù her boyfriend. I really can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs something so shallow and pathetic about it; the way she‚Äôs willing to throw away her friends and family for a guy she has been acquainted with for just‚Ä¶ two weeks? Besides, she is extremely boring, the sort which makes you fall asleep while she talks. And if she‚Äôs not obsessing over Edward, she does, well, nothing but whines, or tells him and his family that she doesn‚Äôt want to be rescued.

I would have liked it if Meyer had given her a little backbone and some brain cells, so she can get out of the stupid situations she puts her stupid self in. I don‚Äôt buy her ‚ÄúI grew up in Phoenix‚Äù statement. Nobody who grew up in Phoenix would be an idiot enough to wander around empty streets of an unfamiliar city alone. Then again, her idiocy is necessary to give way to her savior, Edward Cullen.

Edward is a vampire ‚Äì oops! ‚Äì a perfect vampire. He‚Äôs the most beautiful thing which ever existed‚Ä¶ Have I mentioned that he‚Äôs perfect? And that he has topaz eyes? 

He‚Äôs also bipolar. He‚Äôs serious one time, and then laughs exuberantly another. Insane mood swings, I tell you. He‚Äôs supposed to be your perfect male protagonist ‚Äì hawt!!! (not hot; it should be hawt and must always be followed by three exclamation points), dangerous, smart, mysterious, perfect, and, uhm, sparkly (although the last adjective is not really required; it‚Äôs just a bonus if you‚Äôre lucky enough). He has this stalker-ish behavior, which is sick: He sneaks into Bella‚Äôs room and watches her sleep before they even get to talk. Some think that it‚Äôs romantic, but it‚Äôs just creepy. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs so romantic about it. 

Edward is 100-something years old and lives with his vampire family. Apparently he and his family don‚Äôt drink human blood, because they don‚Äôt want to be completely evil. They‚Äôre vegetarians: They only drink blood of animals. They are basically good vampires, and they also play baseball in the woods to pass the time. Also, every myth about vampire is WRONG! Stakes, garlic, sleeping in coffin (although the idea of not sleeping ever was okay) ‚Äì even sunlight!

But you know, age and race don‚Äôt matter in this book, because Edward and Bella actually fall in love! As for the reason‚Ä¶ what is the reason again? Oh, because Bella smells good and Edward is hawt!!!. They‚Äôre made for each other! It‚Äôs destiny! 

Seriously, though, the romance between them is forced and trite. And it‚Äôs even more boring than they both are, because they have no personality whatsoever. I'm not even sure if there's romance at all. There is no development of feelings. Just‚Ä¶ BAM! They‚Äôre in love! They don‚Äôt even do anything but talk about how in love they are. From there, everything becomes sheer selfishness, and for the nth time, stupidity. Bella‚Äôs life revolves around her boyfriend, and nothing more. Not only is it absurd; it also gives horrible messages, namely:

1. It‚Äôs okay to fall in love in a matter of days and then risk your life for it.
2. You don‚Äôt have to have dreams or goals or anything like that; just get a girl/boyfriend. It‚Äôs far more important!
3. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to lie to your parents especially when it concerns your girl/boyfriend.
4. Ditch your friends. Girl/Boyfriend first, I tell you! Girl/Boyfriend first!

Considering the fact that Edward is so much older than Bella, shouldn‚Äôt he be more rational? More mature? Knowing he can kill Bella, he should have just left her alone. And how come Edward just blabbers everything to Bella? You know, the vampire stuff? For someone who has been in this world for more than a hundred years, he sure displays the maturity of a fetus.

And he‚Äôs supposed to be dangerous. That could have worked, if only Bella had the wits to be actually scared. It‚Äôs funny; that girl‚Äôs so brainless you can‚Äôt possibly scare her! As for Edward, it would have been better if he had shown how dangerous he could be. I don't know, maybe good vampires can only talk about how dangerous they area instead of actually showing it.

Oh, how could I forget! Edward SPARKLES UNDER THE SUN! Did you know that? Isn‚Äôt that cool? The coolest thing ever? It‚Äôs like the most magnificent thing next to Edward! He sparkles ‚Äúlike thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface‚Äù of his skin! Sparkling! Glittering! Glistening! Scintillating! Oh! my! gosh! Meyer is so original! Who else could have thought that?!

The plot is absolutely zero (the romance between Bella and Edward is not a plot). It‚Äôs basically just ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a vampire, she‚Äôs not. They fall in love. End of story.‚Äù And there were a lot of loopholes:

1. Why would the Cullens want to study in high school?! This is my number one question. Hello? Who wants to go through high school over and over again??
2. Why would they want to blend in with the rest of humanity?
3. Why would they put themselves near humans when they know it‚Äôs hard to resist biting them?
4. Why would one bad vampire like to bite Bella specifically?

I‚Äôd like to answer and expand on loophole 4, because it‚Äôs absolutely preposterous. I didn‚Äôt even care about that James vampire when he appeared, because his arrival was so cliched and so late. It‚Äôs like Meyer suddenly remembered that there should be something climax-y in Twilight, just to give it a semblance of a plot. ""This James ought to do the trick. He should be the one to threaten Bella‚Äôs life and then she makes an insanely silly mistake and she almost gets killed BUT Edward rescues her!""

Meyer‚Äôs writing style isn‚Äôt something to commend on either; she writes like a twelve-year old. She makes Dan Brown look like a Pulitzer Prize winner. Her words are stilted. The narration is unexciting, dragging, and redundant. Bella keeps telling the readers how much she hates the rain in the first 100 pages of the book, and how she can‚Äôt dance. If not that, she repetitively says how perfect and beautiful Edward is. What‚Äôs ironic is that despite all the perfect descriptions of him, I never quite pictured him in my mind. I‚Äôm still wondering how the rest of humanity can drool and squeal at the thought of him.

Bella glares all the time, too. Bella also grimaces a lot, and hisses, and stumbles. Glares, grimaces, hisses, stumbles. Four redundant freakin‚Äô verbs in a 500-page book. That‚Äôs not so much, unless you can count only to three. 

Meanwhile, Edward always smiles his crooked smile, and he dazzles people (especially Bella).

Nobody ‚Äòsaid‚Äô anything. Characters only ‚Äògasped‚Äô, ‚Äòchuckled‚Äô, ‚Äòquestioned‚Äô, and ‚Äòanswered‚Äô. 

Meyer also occasionally uses ridiculously long AND obscure words, which don‚Äôt quite fit since the rest of her words are plain and simple. I remember one: Ostentatious. She could have simply used ‚Äòshowy‚Äô or ‚Äòflamboyant‚Äô, but it just had to be ostentatious. Why she used that, I‚Äôve no idea. (In the next books, Meyer uses bigger words. I wonder how big they are‚Ä¶)

And you know, Meyer ends Twilight with Bella attending the PROM. That‚Äôs how a vampire story should end: The heroine should attend the prom with her vampire boyfriend. In that ruffled gown and stiletto heels‚Ä¶ It just makes sense (although it did take Bella about ten years to figure out Edward is taking her to the prom. What an idiot). Meyer skipped the almost action-y part (Emmett and Jasper‚Äôs dealing with James) but she elaborates on the prom.

Now that I‚Äôve finished reading and dissecting Twilight, I still don‚Äôt understand all the hype it‚Äôs getting. It reads like a bad fan fic. I won't stop you from reading it, though. That's a choice for you to make."

172,Paul Bryant,Crime and Punishment ,"Apr 15, 2020",5,"Well, what‚Äôs a global pandemic for if you don‚Äôt read the stuff you think you really ought to have read by now. Although I hope this strange circumstance will not result in me referring to Fyodor Dostoyevsky as The Corona Guy.

Those yet to read this towering inferno of literature may wish to know what‚Äôs in the nearly 700 pages, so here is a scientific analysis :

WHAT HAPPENS IN CRIME AND PUNISHMENT

Long conversations between people who could talk the hind legs off a donkey: .....................53%
People going mad and running about wildly or quietly chewing the wallpaper in their tiny room : .........11%
People being in debt :.................. 41.7%
People being unsteady on their legs due to vast consumption of vodka :.................... 51%
People being ill (physical) :.................... 34%
People being ill (mental) :...‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶37%
People contemplating suicide :...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶19%
People enjoying a pleasant stroll in the countryside : .....0%
People having a friendly chat over a cup of coffee :... 0.03%
Men figuring they can force a poor woman to marry them :.....‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 36%
Women being terrified :...‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 39%
Horses being beaten :...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶... 2%
Nothing exciting happening :...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. 0%

This all adds up to more than 100%. That is because C&P is a very excessive novel. It has more than 100% inside it.

INTERVIEW WITH F DOSTOYEVSKY, 18 March 1867

FD : You see, in my books...the numbers all go to eleven. Look...right across the board. 

V. M Vorshynsky: Ahh...oh, I see.... 

FD : All other novelists, they only go up to 10. But I go up to 11.

V. M Vorshynsky:: Does that mean you have more emotion in your books ?

FD: Well, it's one whole notch more, isn't it? It's not ten. You see, most...most novelists, you know, they don‚Äôt know eleven exists. I get my characters all the way to ten with their emotional situations, and then...push over the cliff. See? 

V. M Vorshynsky: Put it up to eleven. 

FD: Eleven. Exactly. One louder.

And it‚Äôs really true. If they are not about to jump into a river, they are going to fall in love with a prostitute, or they are going to get roaring drunk because they have fallen in love with a prostitute and will later jump into a river.

CAN WE GET SLIGHTLY MORE SERIOUS PLEASE

C&P surprised me. It was like a Dardenne Brothers movie with the camera tight up to Raskolnikov nearly the whole time, and the action shown in detail almost hour by hour over a couple of weeks. Yes it‚Äôs a whole lot about th psychological disintegration of this arrogant twerp who thinks he might be some kind of extraordinary person destined to improve the human race by sheer power of his brainwaves & so therefore is justified in bashing in the head of some horrible old woman pawnbroker to steal her money and kickstart his wonderful career. And bash in the brains of her sister who unfortunately comes in the door at the wrong moment. Bad timing.

But it seemed to me that at least half of C&P was all about the horrible powerlessness of women and how they are forced into marriages which are no more than licenced prostitution. An antidote to Jane Austen, indeed. 

And it was about how the arrogant twerp murderer can also be a guy who perceives this injustice and wants to revolutionise society. And to do that he starts by bashing in the brains of two women. 
So you see this is a psychological minefield we are in. 

Like Macbeth and An American Tragedy by Dreiser the murder is contemplated beforehand, then committed, then acts like acid on the mind of its perpetrator, and the reader is along for the excruciating ride.

Thre are hundreds of connections that trigger like flashing synapses as you go through this big ass book‚Ä¶ Freud, Leopold and Loeb, the philosophy of the Nazi Party, Camus, Beckett‚Ä¶ 
 
I do admit that there are probably three windbags too many in C&P and I could think of snipping a chapter here and a chapter there to get the whole thing down to a tight 500 pages of ranting and caterwauling. But all in all, this novel rides all over you like an out of control ox cart & will leave you gasping and discombobulated.

Conclusion : excellent pandemic reading"

174,Mark Lawrence,The Lightning Thief ,"Feb 16, 2017",5,"I've read all (I think) of this series to my daughter, Celyn, but somehow this one escaped being reviewed until now.

I half-watched the film a year or two before we read this. Actually it was Rick reading (and being kind enough to review) my own trilogy that steered me toward picking up these books for Celyn (she's very disabled and can't read books for herself).

Anyway, it was a very good read. Celyn enjoyed the action and humour, and I enjoyed seeing the Greek legends I loved reading about as a kid given a new lease of life, offered up to the most recent generation.

It starts off with that irresistible device beloved of fantasy books that you (vicariously the hero) were meant for more than this regular old world and that all those odd things you don't understand about everyday life ... really are odd and full of special meaning. In fact ... your dad's a god, and not just any old god but Poseidon himself. And that means you're part god yourself! Hoorah!

So Percy gets inducted into hero school, makes friends with good monsters, fights and kills bad ones, and dives into adventure.

The hero school (Camp Halfblood) has demi-gods descended from all the Greek mythos, which makes for fun conflicts. Meanwhile in the wider world there are rumblings that the titans (from whom the gods wrested control of the world at the dawn of time) are about to stage a comeback. Zeus has lost his lightning bolt and the thief must be found before the gods fall to blows and Olympus topples.

The genius is in the mix of modern day America with all its kitsch, landmarks, cities etc with mythical Greece. It shouldn't really work, but does. And to cap it all, your kid is getting a classical education on the sly!

175,Kellie,Wuthering Heights,"Feb 07, 2008",1,"I read this book for my AP Literature class. I loved the teacher, loved the subject matter, and loved pretty much everything else we had read, so I had high hopes for this book. I must say, I made a genuine and sincere effort to like this book, I really did. I got half way through with no hope in sight, yet I perservered, hoping the second half would show promise in the next generation. No such luck. Although nothing tops the finale ""love scene"" between Heathcliff and Katherine, with Heathcliff foaming at the mouth and a verbal battle of ""no, YOU killed me"" ""no, you killed yourself"" (a stupidity hiterto unknown since the ""no YOU'RE prettier"" battles). Eventually, the final pages came into view and I was desperate- there must be some redemption for this junk! Some message, some ending sequence, SOMETHING that makes this worthwhile. The characters are so self-absorbed and posses an unprecendeted lack of intelligence, yet are still portrayed as intelligent by the literary world, that it seemed like the only fitting ending would be the characters realizing their stupidity and engaging in a mass suicide. No such luck. Every last word was idiotic and as empty as the first. But you know what grinds my gears even more than the fact that I wasted a week on this worthless pseudo-classic? It kills me that people not only mistake this hoax for real literature, but reference it for ROMANTIC value! Foaming at the mouth, marrying someone you don't love, wow.... now that's a level of romance lovers fantasize about achieving."
176,Tadiana ‚ú©Night Owl‚òΩ,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Feb 11, 2013",4,"I just finished reading this for the first time since, maybe college? Twelve year old Meg Murry, her precocious five year old brother Charles Wallace, and their new friend Calvin meet some highly odd beings who call themselves Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which. This strange, quirky trio sweeps the children away on an interstellar quest to find and rescue Meg and Charles Wallace's missing father. They fold space and time through tesseracts (the ""wrinkle"" in time and space) and battle the darkness that has taken over other planets and shadows ours.

This 1962 book is noticeably old-fashioned and a little simplistic in several ways. The symbolism and the links to religion and scriptures aren't subtle, and Meg's anger and stubbornness gets old, though it's interesting to see how those character traits can in some situations stand her in good stead. Also, in fairness it is a middle grade book, though a lot of older readers love it. There's something really lovely about the book's ultimate message and themes. I enjoyed revisiting it again after all these years.

I'm going to stick with my original 4 star rating, though I'm pretty sure that the nostalgia factor is playing into this rating. Full review to come!

January 2018 buddy read with the Pantaloonless group. 

Original post: I read this book at least two or three times when I was a teen/young adult (actually, I own and have read the entire series), but it's been a long while since I last read this. I'm interested to see how it holds up!"
177,Marte,The Alchemist,"Sep 22, 2007",1,"Utter drivel. The book was badly written, righteous, condescending, preachy, and worst of all, the ending was morally questionable. All the fables and stories are stolen from elsewhere, religious ideas and spirituality are badly mixed, and everything is so obvious.

The book harps on about tapping into the Soul of the World, the Language of the World, about your one true path and other nonsense. The basic idea is that if you really want something and ""listen to your heart"", the whole universe will help you achieve it if you only look for omens. A questionable idea in a world where people no longer want to work hard and achieve independently.

It reads like a really bad self-help book written for 8 year old children and disguised as a symbolic parable. I read a lot of books and I can safely say this is the worst book I have ever read. It's only saving grace was that it was mercifully short."
178,Mk,Lord of the Flies,"Feb 25, 2008",1,"I hated this book. First off, as I remember, it talks about humans failure to govern ourselves, or more broadly the failures of human nature. There are a few reasons why I think simply dropping a group of kids on a desert island does not in fact prove anything.

1) These kids were raised in a capitalist, nominally demcratic society. The first thing they do is appoint leaders. As someone who spends my time working in consensus based groups seeking to challenge hierarchical structures, I have a strong belief that this is not how things need to be. It takes a bunch of unlearning and relearning to use these formats - simply being in a new space or being a child does not do this work. The author and the children he writes about are a part of a specific culture, and it's incorrect to generalize these values to a broader concept of human nature.

2) They're all boys! Again, socialization (yes, even of a 6 year old) plays a huge role in what behavior we see as appropriate. While it's quite true that men (or at least masculinity) control government, it's ridiculous to use only boys to extrapolate what ways of governing ourselves are possible.

I read this book in 1996 when I was a freshman in highschool, so maybe there's something I missed. Or maybe my memories are being colored by just how gross the pig's head descriptions were. If so, feel free to correct me. For now though, I have to say that this book is offensive and makes dangerous assumption."
179,Michael,Les Mis√©rables,"Jan 17, 2018",5,"This will be another review-as-I-go!

First, a thank you to Rachel for recommending the Fahnestock and MacAfee translation, which is wonderful so far!

Next, a question: Why have I been so drawn lately to these 1,500 page 19th century behemoths? War and Peace, The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, and now this. Am I just a glutton for punishment? Or just showing off? I hope not. When I think about it, I think it has to do with the moral scope and depth of the work and the way these books really wear their morality on their sleeves. They're complex, yes, but they're not hiding their morality behind some veneer of ""show, don't tell."" They're not afraid to plumb the moral depths of the societies they depict, and I think, when I look around at the society I inhabit, that I hunger for more of this. So here I have it.

Hugo certainly takes his time setting up the main action, with a long introductory section on the Bishop (Myriel) before we get to the main character, Jean Valjean. But for some reason it works, so that by the time Valjean arrives on the scene, we have a sense of the place he comes to and the reactions he'll face. Even then, Myriel stands apart from the others in his generosity and kindness, such that the other characters don't even comprehend his attitude. Which of course says as much about contemporary attitudes toward ex-convicts as it does about Myriel himself.

Then the scene shifts, and we're treated to a lighthearted section of youthful fun, but there's a dark undercurrent here too--the illegitimate child born to Fantine, the child named Cosette, who's given up to another family while Fantine finds work and who soon transforms from a happy toddler to a bedraggled house servant. Oh, the heartbreak and misery we experience when she's described sweeping the sidewalk in the cold, dressed only in rags.

The scene then shifts to follow Fantine, and we see her gradual decline as she tried ever more desperately to raise money to send the family housing her daughter. Eventually she sells her two front teeth and becomes a ""woman of the streets,"" which is where she has a run-in with the police officer Javert--a character reminiscent of Angelo from Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, a stern agent of the law whose facade of righteousness conceals much. Luckily for Fantine, the mayor intercedes on her behalf.

Then the two parts of the story so far--that of Valjean and that of Fantine--come together, when it's revealed that the mayor is himself Valjean, years later. Oh, the plot thickens, because Javert was an officer who knew and tried to find Valjean years ago, and suddenly declares to the mayor that Valjean was found in the distant town of Arras and will be tried. What does Valjean do? Continue to conceal his identity so that he may do more good, knowing that someone else will suffer in his place? Or declare himself and lose everything? It's quite a magnificent dramatic moment.

And the drama really picks up pace when Valjean rides to Arras to the trial. Will he get there on time? And then there he is, in the courtroom: will he reveal himself? And when he does: will he be arrested right away? How can he escape? It's pure melodrama, in a way, yet fused to the deep moral quandary in the character that makes it irresistible. 

One of the techniques I see Hugo employing is to switch storylines suddenly, leaving the reader with no idea how they relate, until at the very end of the storyline, he reveals it: Aha! When Valjean is on his way to Cosette, Hugo makes a huge detour into the history of Waterloo and Napoleon's downfall, and you wonder for pages and pages what this has to do with the story, and then at the very end, we see that one of the haggard men stealing from corpses is the father of the family keeping Cosette, and that another officer, who thinks the haggard man has saved him, declares himself in his debt. You can feel Hugo in those lines lowering the boom for more drama to come.

Hugo is really setting things up now. We get Valjean and Cosette finally ensconced in Paris, and then the scene shifts to examine a new character, Marius, the son of Pontmercy (who thought the father of the family keeping Cosette saved him). Again, you can see the giant cogs in motion, setting up the eventual collision between all these forces. Just an awesome array of characters and plot points, and I can't wait to see how it's going to come together!

Not surprisingly, Marius and Cosette grow up and grow fond of each other through random meetings in Paris. If I had one critique of this book, it's that so much depends on these random meetings of the characters. They keep bumping into each other, as if there were only a few people in the city. But this is a minor critique, and the randomness might even be intentional, making the point that much of life is similarly guided by chance encounters.

Now the political scene intervenes: the uprising. One of the saddest characters in the book is Epinone, the daughter of the horrible innkeeper, who acts more than once to keep Marius out of danger. She's clearly in love with him, but she's been so deformed by poverty and the demands of her harsh parents that she feels unable to express that. Anyway, the uprising is where she performs her ultimate act of bravery and self-sacrifice, and it nearly brought tears to my eyes.

I can't really do the ending any justice through summary. Let me just say that Hugo brings this entire monumental project together masterfully. If Modernism is defined by ironic detachment, this is the ultimate pre-modern work. It's earnest, political, passionate, encyclopedic, and moralistic in the very best sense. Hugo clearly has a point he's trying to make about human goodness, and I deeply appreciate the project. To say it's moved me is a terrific understatement. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it and its characters since finishing reading a couple of days ago. This is an epic and almost mythical work, and it stands as one of the best novels I've read."

181,Ajeje Brazov,Alice nel paese delle meraviglie e Attraverso lo specchio,"Oct 07, 2020",4,"Alice nel paese delle meraviglie e Attraverso lo specchio sono i racconti pi√π famosi dell'autore. Ne sono state tratte un'infinit√† di versioni cinematografiche. Quella della Disney, da piccolo, girava spesso e ne avevo visionato gran parte, ma non mi entusiasmava mai granch√®. Cos√¨ rimase nel limbo per decenni.
Nell'ultimo periodo risalta fuori il discorso, cos√¨ lo prendo e lo inizio. La prima parte mi √® risultata un po' distante, forse perch√® √® il pezzo che mi ricordo di pi√π dall'infanzia e mi annoiava, ma pian piano la narrazione, le ambientazioni, i giochini di parole (spiegati nelle note) e tutto l'universo del nonsense, incominciavano ad affiorare in superficie ed io ne venivo, gradatamente, immerso nel suo fascino sognante, fantastico.
Un aspetto che mi ha colpito √® quel sviluppare i ""personaggi"" animali, che seppur antropomorfizzati (aspetto che odio in tutti i cartoni animati), risultano particolari e non degli umani travestiti da animali. Difficile da spiegare, ma alla fine questi animali mi sono stati presentati come lo specchio della fantasia, dell'estrosit√† della bambina, cos√¨ come anche altri esseri viventi, per esempio i fiori. Alice, o qualsiasi altra bambina o qualsiasi altro bambino, vive nella Natura (ora, a 150 anni di distanza, forse non sar√† pi√π cos√¨) ed immersa in essa, ne vede un lato particolare che nessun altro adulto potr√† mai cogliere, perch√® la fanciullezza √® ancora lontana, riparata da ci√≤ che verr√† con l'et√† adulta e cio√® la perdita della visionariet√†, della fantasia pi√π sfrenata, astratta e surreale, data da un'educazione ad essere: ligio alle regole, al pragmatismo, alla concretezza.
Le bellissime illustrazioni poi, arricchiscono e non poco la narrazione, dando quel tocco artistico e immaginifico al racconto.
Vado a giocare a scacchi!"

One of the worst books I have ever read. The experience was excruciating. 

30/5/20
Giving this one another shot. Tried last year and the first 30 pages were so painful. Did a lot of research on this book (spoke to a couple of people as well) and I feel like if I don't get through it this time around, I probably never will.

I got this book at the De Slegte many years ago but never read it. However now, Rory Power is bringing out a book coming July called Wilder Girls, with I heard is a feminist retelling of this. I'm hoping to compare the two, so this might just be the push for me to finally read this one :)

183,Fabian,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Dec 02, 2014",4,"Well, I finally got around to this one. & I think I understand its fan base and its subsequent literary worth; it was the ""Gone Girl"" of the 90's. (Only in popularity.) This time, the fairy tale (with ""Girl"" it seems as if we're more comfortable with the cautionary tale in the 10's) has a Cinderella and many suitors after her. It is absolutely immersive... a page turner that has as many colors as a used-up coloring book. I see the geisha in that light: like La Marilyn, the geisha are symbol of tragedy and misplaced youth and beauty.

The plot is orchestrated in that well-intentioned Great Novel tradition. A Great Expectations-meets-Great Gatsby novelty item that's as pure as winter's snow, that shimmers & attracts the senses like a ruby from some volcano deep in the Pacific. Metaphors and similes are very effectively used here, & their dual purpose is clear: it tells the life story in a very non-nebulous manner, in clear, concise, not-to-be-misconstrued mode; and the words seem authentic enough to evoke an actual geisha-- it is her telling you her memoirs, sitting there with you, drinking tea.

Also, Hastumomo, in the role of ugly stepsister, is an adversary from hell. Grrrreat character! Too bad she leaves the narrative at too-crucial a juncture (the anticlimax meaning, then, the immediate displacement of anything that did not fit into the societal standards from the board... Lame!). She is a worthy nemesis to our heroine--as voracious for fresh meat as a Great White. The feud between them two is the centerpiece of this Fanny Hill-like tale, this enormously feminist (?) text. For in Gion, Japan, the geisha are treated like a lot of women have been, like objects, pawns, or even disembodied ideas."

A lot has happened in the world since I read this in high school in the mid-1990s. The book is as interesting and powerful as I remember. However, I think having an adult perspective on life, government, laws, taxes, rights, etc. makes this a much more powerful for me now than it was when I was a teenager. 

One of the great things about this book, too, is that it is not very long. I think that morality tales with political undertones can be daunting if you know you are dealing with a 300-page book. This tells a strong tale in 125 pages or so that is easy to read but difficult to swallow. An allegory that is a must read for all!

I will also say that this book has an ending that I remember as being ‚Äúwow, but not super shocking‚Äù as a teenager. Now, it is absolutely terrifying ‚Äì it gave me chills!

Original review

One of the best - no doubt! So much symbolism and meaning crammed into such a small book. Also, a great use of anthropomorphism (I just wanted to use a big, fancy sounding word!)

Review wise, that is about all I need to say - it is great, read it!

But, I will add this anecdote . . .

I read this when I was in High School as required reading. Most required reading books were long and not all that exciting (I am looking at you, Jane Eyre!) But, this one was so good that I couldn't put it down. And, since it is so short, I read it in one night. Well, the teacher had assigned chapters and asked us not to read ahead. Still hard to believe I got in trouble for reading too much of a required reading book!"

188,jessica,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Aug 09, 2012",5,"nothing makes me feel more nostalgic than this book. 

this book is long summer nights, spent with those we so carefully let in, not caring about what the next year of school would bring. just those evenings where our only companions were the stars. because in those moments, i swear we were infinite. 

thats what this book is. those moments that truly define who we are and what happiness to means to us. this book is our teenage years filled with friendship, and angst, and heartbreak, and future planning, and everything in between. 

this book is the yearning for the past, whilst also looking forward to the days to come. 

my heart will always belong to the memories of this book. 

‚Ü† 4.5 stars"
189,Kemper,Brave New World,"Aug 02, 2011",4,"Warning! The following review contains humor. If you read it and actually think that I'm being critical of Huxley, try reading it again. (Here's a hint. Look for the irony of the italicized parts when compared to the previous statements.) If you post a comment that asserts that I'm wrong/ stupid/ crazy for this and/or try to lecture me on all the points you think I missed then I'm going to assume that you read it literally, missed the joke, didn't read the other comments where I've already answered this about a dozen times, and I will delete your post. 

I have to apologize for this review. The concept of this book was so outlandish that I think it made my mind wander, and you may find some odd random thoughts scattered in it. 

Anyhow, this book was so silly and unrealistic. Like any of this could happen. In the far future the babies are genetically engineered and designed for certain stations in life with a large workforce bred to be happy with menial jobs that don‚Äôt stress them physically or mentally. I really should look into getting that data entry position I saw in the job postings. It‚Äôd be a lot less stressful than what I‚Äòm doing now. 

In addition to all the genetic modifications, the children are raised by the state, and words like ‚Äôfather‚Äô and ‚Äômother‚Äô are considered obscenities. Subliminal messaging through infancy and childhood also condition people to repeat idiotic platitudes as if they are genuine wisdom. I‚Äôve been in a bad mood today. I need to turn that frown upside down. And since the world economy depends on constant consumption by the highest classes, they‚Äôre encouraged to be wasteful The collars on a couple of my shirts are a little frayed. I should go buy some new ones and throw the old ones out. and to engage in activities that demand spending and resource use. Should I get a new set of golf clubs? I lost my old ones when we moved, but I hadn‚Äôt played in a long time. But would I play more if I got new clubs? There‚Äòs that really nice looking course right down the street. I don‚Äòt know how they keep the grass that green in this heat. The population even gets to zip around in their own private helicopters rather than cars. Man, when are they going to come out with jet packs for everyone. It‚Äôs 2011 and I‚Äôm still driving around in a car like a chump. I want my jet pack!

Casual sex is actively encouraged. Wow. These condom commercials on TV have gotten really racy. The population is also programmed to be constantly partaking of some form of entertainment and to never just sit quietly and think I‚Äôm bored. Writing is boring. or to be alone Let‚Äôs check Facebook and see what all my friends are doing.

One of the sillier ideas is that the foundation of this society is Henry Ford‚Äôs assembly lines and that Ford has become the most revered figure in history. Like a businessman could ever become that popular. Is Steve Jobs making any announcements this week? I get itchy when there‚Äòs no new Apple products. 

While everyone seeks to be constantly entertained, all of the entertainment panders to the lowest common denominator. Hey, Jersey Shore is on! and the emphasis is on presenting it with gimmicks to engage the audience like ‚Äôthe feelies‚Äô, movies that the audience can also smell and feel the sensation from. I wonder if they‚Äôll re-release Avatar at the movies so I can see it in 3D again like James Cameron intended? At one point, a character complains about the feelies, ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre told by an idiot‚Ä¶.works of art out of practically nothing but pure sensation.‚Äù I should go see that new Michael Bay Transformers movie.

Perhaps the most far fetched idea in this is that the population has been trained to sedate themselves with a drug called soma that relives any potential anxieties and keeps people from thinking about anything upsetting. I want a beer.

I guess this Huxley guy might have gotten lucky and predicted a few things, but he was way off base about where society was going."
190,Claudia Lomel√≠,The Little Prince,"Feb 04, 2014",5,"Pero qu√© cosa tan m√°s hermosa.

Tengo un vago recuerdo de haberlo le√≠do cuando estaba peque√±a, pero ni de cerca me impact√≥ como me ha impactado ahora."
191,Justin Tate,Dracula,"Aug 05, 2021",5,"Dracula seems to be one of those love-it or hate-it type books, but for me it is all love! The opening chapters alone provide some of the most gripping, suspense-inducing, edge-of-seat anxieties I've ever read, all leading up to a delightfully queer twist with a male character stepping in for the traditional Gothic heroine.

Jonathan Harker fulfills the damsel in distress role quite suitably, being locked away in a remote castle and forced to navigate the domineering personality of his captor. Dracula is reminiscent of Montoni from Ann Radcliffe‚Äôs The Mysteries of Udolpho, particularly in the way he has control over Jonathan's sexual well-being. When the three weird sisters close in on an unaccompanied Jonathan, Dracula stops them at the last second, saying ‚ÄúThis man belongs to me!‚Äù before Harker ‚Äúsank down unconscious.""

Outside of Jonathan getting his chance to faint like the best of Gothic women, this dominating dialogue can't help but have a sexual undertone. There's just something about a vampire's possessiveness, affixation with tender neck flesh, the nocturnal visits and dangling appeal of immortality that make them hot, hot, hot! Some readers may read terror in these lines, but I think it's hard to deny at least some titillation at Jonathan‚Äôs situation of total submission. Anyway, it is possible to have two feelings at once. Horror and eroticism may seem like polar opposites, but I think they go together like PB&J.

Dracula‚Äôs female selections also get to experience this ethereal mixture of terror and desire while under the vampire‚Äôs spell. Lucy dazedly roams the midnight hour in her nightgown, meeting the ""king vampire"" for a moonlit rendezvous. Mina, too, the novel's surprisingly dynamic female star, a rare treat in 19th century lit, goes so far as to engage in a bizarre perversity of sucking upon Dracula‚Äôs bleeding breast. Though she claims to be induced to such behavior by a trance, one wonders how much arm-twisting or brain fog was necessary. If we are to see the vampire‚Äôs bite as sexually desirable, symbolically or literally, perhaps these creatures of the night are less monster and more orchestrator of dreams. After all, Dracula is a convenient outlet for taboos to be explored, experienced, and excused from public shame. Something like that might have been especially appealing to a sexually repressed 1897 audience.

Despite being the most famous and enduring vampire novel of all time, Dracula remains a must-read classic. You won't be surprised by some details because Stoker's vampire ""rules"" are public knowledge by now, but that doesn't make the novel any less thrilling, enticing, and occasionally shocking. There's some really gruesome moments that totally caught me off guard. Also, the epistolary storytelling device works well. There's a lot of subtleties hidden in the diary entries that slowly build horror‚Äîarguably too slowly‚Äîand the effect is notably more realistic and more chilling than even the novel‚Äôs impressive reputation had me expecting. So happy to finally check this read off my bucket list!!

PS: For Stephen King fans, IT is so clearly modeled after Dracula that it's almost shocking. Every beat of this classic appears somewhere in King's book, with Dracula and Pennywise sharing many traits and the power of working together being a major theme. The way the monster controls side characters is also familiar. Renfield and Henry Bowers share a lot in common, for instance, as do Mina and Bill's wife."
192,Briynne,The Outsiders,"Oct 03, 2007",5,"I'm a little horrified at myself for not having this book up before now. We had a discussion about it in class today, and I had to write this as soon it was over. I wish there were more stars to give The Outsiders, but five will have to do. I love this book, and have loved it faithfully since I read it in sixth grade - I must have read it a dozen times, and possibly more. I can quote long sections of the book. I was obsessed, and to some degree still am. 

It's not a good book by any literary standard, really. Hinton uses one of those usually awful formulaic introductions that devotes a paragraph to each main character, explicitly describing their characteristics, history, and appearance. When I think of it objectively, it's almost as bad as that awful, awful introductory second chapter of the Babysitters Club books that repeats in every installment. 

I think the point is, though, that I just don't care. In fact, I adore the writing even though it is obvious. Maybe because I first read it when I was eleven and that sort of writing just seemed clear and to-the-point. At any rate, I don't think it suffers too badly from the style, and if anything it benefits from the authenticity of a teenage author. 

I can't even begin to say what it was about this book that caught my interest and imagination so completely. I liked the otherness of it - I had never experienced anything like these boys dealt with. Not the pervasive fear and violence, not the absentee, non-existent, or abusive parents, and definitely not the fascinating siege-mentality camaraderie that existed in their group. 

The best part of the book, without any doubt, is the characters she has created. I love them all, with the exception of Steve. They are wonderful and so sympathetic, with their odd names and ill-fated lives. I hope for the ending to change every time I read it. Ponyboy's voice, which narrates the story, has a beautiful vulnerability and honesty that makes the story believable. He's often confused, hurt, scared, sorry, and just feels like things are wrong; but, he's also brave and kind and takes chances on people. I think that Hinton's allowing her main character to be a real person, who is more often than not unsure of everything he does, gives the book its credibility with teenagers. 

Fantastic, must-read, childhood-defining book. Reading Hinton's ""That Was Then, This is Now"" is worth it just for the few brief cameos a slightly older Ponyboy makes throughout the story."
193,Reading_ Tamishly,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Sep 12, 2019",5,"***this book hurt me the worst when it ended because of the realisation about Charlie and because it ended.

""I gave Sam To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, Hamlet, Walden, and The Fountainhead.""

If I were Sam, I would have fallen in love with you, Charlie, right there!

I don't think this will ever happen in my life having someone giving me all their favourite books on a special day (while there's no doubt about me gifting all my favourite books even to my enemies anyday) I wanted to be Sam so much because Charlie was giving her all his favourite books üíù the young love made immortal üíì

I saw Sam as Emma Watson during the whole time because of that stupid movie adaptation ‚ò∫Ô∏è But yes, Hermione Granger - Emma Watson Sam is fine. Will always work. I guess. 

*As much as I love this book, I really cannot stand the movie adaptation. It makes me frustrated. Just like that. I tried watching the movie twice but ended up getting frustrated everytime. So no. The book is the best for me. 

****no review can explain why this book is so precious***

Find all the negative things you would want to hate about this book, I can tell you many.

But those things make me love this book so much!

It's like my whole being is brimming with emotions that my head stops thinking when I try to think about Charlie and the various other characters and how Charlie sees things.


This book is so different from when I read it for the first time. I remember the friendship stories yet what touched me the most during that read was the way how Charlie read books and interpreted things; about how he had an understanding adult around. 

But this time, my heart is filled with wholesomeness after rereading the book after a gap of more than 2 years. 

I can understand the characters better. Not just Charlie but also Sam, Patrick, Mary Elizabeth, Peter (though his part is almost blink and gone kind), Brad, Bill, even the gone aunt, the sister and thr brother, the parents as well. 



*Review below was written after I read the book for the first time in 2018:


‚ú®One of the best character driven story
‚ú®One of the best Young Adult fiction ever
‚ú®This one talks about books and reading (actually only this would have sufficed to make it into the best reading list!)
‚ú®The adults especially one significant adult has a main role in shaping the main character
‚ú®Pangs of young love
‚ú®Subtleness in the LGBTQ representation 
‚ú®Unapologetic writing and plot"
194,Tahera,The Secret Garden,"Nov 02, 2017",5,"This was an absolute joy ride and like my friend Karin put it, it was 'lovely and heartwarming' üòä."
195,Karina,The Secret Garden,"Mar 30, 2023",4,"She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. (PG 4)

It was an adventure reading this as an adult. It was beautiful to read about kids having an imagination especially in the type of world and environment we live in. I personally know of parents and children (older and young) who only speak in reference to TikTok or YouTube. I don't want to criticize anyone's choices because they don't affect me personally or my journey in life but it's disturbing to see a baby or toddler fiddling with the phone next to their parents.

This book was a great reminder of nature needing children and children needing nature. The possibilities are endless. Nature and spirituality (what they call Magic) are great for the soul as we see here. The kid's personalities evolve from spoiled little jerks to kind and happy beings. 

I just loved the simpleness of the story. The wholehearted message. The illustrations by Tasha Tudor added an extra layer of enjoyment."
196,Glenn Sumi,Lord of the Flies,"Jun 05, 2018",5,"LORD OF THE REREADINGS

A couple of months ago, I picked up To Kill A Mockingbird, a book I last read in high school. What fascinated me about the exercise was how much I remembered and how much I didn‚Äôt, what I appreciated as a teen and what I do now. 

After that, I began wondering how I would respond to the other books I had to read and analyze as a youth. Hence my rereading of Lord Of The Flies. It‚Äôs equally powerful ‚Äì shocking, even by today‚Äôs standards. And it‚Äôs all very efficiently done.

Both books are deserved classics. I don‚Äôt regret a moment spent rereading either one.

So‚Ä¶ perhaps this will become a series. What‚Äôs next: Catcher In The Rye? A Separate Peace? Anyhow, on with the review... and keep in mind that if you weren't forced to read this back in school, THERE BE SPOILERS AHEAD (or A-HEAD - if you'll excuse the pun).

What do I remember from my first reading?
‚Ä¢ The set-up, of course. After a plane crashes, a group of English boys finds themselves stranded on an island and, with no adults to guide them, form a kind of society that quickly breaks down, resulting in madness and murder.
‚Ä¢ The symbols, among them: the conch (for order and civilization, I suppose, since if one holds it one can speak in front of a group); the glasses (or ‚Äúspecs‚Äù), which help create fire and, since they belong to the nearsighted, brainy yet mercilessly bullied Piggy, might also represent intelligence.
‚Ä¢ The idea of monsters, both real and imagined. 
‚Ä¢ I remember being entertained by the nickname Piggy ‚Äì what a childish thing, but it is memorable and symbolic in its own way. What a smart move on author William Golding‚Äôs part to call him that.
‚Ä¢ The ending. I knew a couple of children died, and that eventually the rest were rescued. 

What don‚Äôt I remember from that reading?
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôd forgotten that many of the book‚Äôs ‚Äúhunters‚Äù were (back in civilian life) members of a choir! 
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôd totally forgotten about the young twins, Sam and Eric, whose names are blended by Golding into the very contemporary-sounding name Samneric. 
‚Ä¢ I should have, but didn‚Äôt, realize the book took place during some unspecified war. 

What do I appreciate now?
‚Ä¢ The economy and compactness of the book. There‚Äôs very little fat in it (besides the fat dripping from the roasted boar). And though there are lots of vivid descriptions of clouds, forests and sun glinting on sand, nothing feels gratuitous.
‚Ä¢ How beautifully Golding captures children‚Äôs behaviour, especially in groups. This was Golding‚Äôs first novel, and he knew boys so well. (Perhaps he was raising sons at the time.)
‚Ä¢ There are lots of characters with Anglo names that sound a lot alike (Ralph, Jack, Roger, Robert, Simon, Henry ‚Äì something that instantly ‚Äúdates‚Äù it, I suppose), but Golding gradually fills you in on them. It took a while for me to understand Roger‚Äôs sadistic nature, for instance.
‚Ä¢ The theme of bullying, which is as relevant as ever. Is this a fact of nature? Does every species find someone/thing among them to tease and ridicule? Piggy is overweight, unathletic, myopic and has asthma (and another thing I didn‚Äôt notice: his speech places him in a slightly lower class than everyone else), but he‚Äôs also incredibly smart. He can see things that the charismatic, initial leader Ralph doesn‚Äôt, which is why they make a good pair. But the fact that everyone, from the oldest to the youngest, teases him, is very disturbing. 
‚Ä¢ The hallucinatory scenes with Simon (often thought of as the book‚Äôs most intuitive character) and the ‚Äúbeast,‚Äù which gives the novel its title. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for the sheer nightmarish horror of these episodes. No wonder Stephen King was so influenced by this book (he borrowed the novel's ‚ÄúCastle Rock‚Äù and uses it regularly as a setting). 
‚Ä¢ The political/social allegory at its centre. How do we make a society work? Is hunting (to feed us) more important than providing shelter or coming up with a way to be rescued? What happens when people don‚Äôt pull their weight?
‚Ä¢ All of this is done so very subtly. There‚Äôs a moment when ‚Äúchief‚Äù Ralph is gradually losing his power, and Piggy suggests he blow the conch to form an assembly. And Ralph knows that if he blows the conch and no one comes, it will be irrevocable. Brilliant observation.
‚Ä¢ The idea of the ‚Äúbeast.‚Äù Is the idea of the ‚Äúother‚Äù something intrinsic and primitive? Or do we create monsters as a mere projection of our own fears? 
‚Ä¢ The little visual details, like Ralph pushing the hair out of his face. It‚Äôs both a naturalistic detail and one that points out how all the boys are becoming savage (funnily enough, Piggy‚Äôs hair doesn‚Äôt grow)
‚Ä¢ I had no idea how exciting the plot got in the last couple of chapters. Golding cranked up the tension to 11. Even though I knew how the book ended, I was still turning every page, heart thumping, hoping Ralph survived being pursued by Jack and his gang.

The few things that didn‚Äôt work this time around: 
‚Ä¢ The line ‚ÄúRalph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man‚Äôs heart‚Ä¶‚Äù in the penultimate paragraph of the book seems way too on the nose. I can imagine a million students underlining that with a big ""Aha!""
‚Ä¢ I forgot Piggy used the N-word. Really. It‚Äôs there.

***

I recalled a lot more of this book than Mockingbird. Once read, it has the power and heft of something that is so true and essential that it must have always been around. (I‚Äôve felt this way about other literary works, like Shirley Jackson‚Äôs short story ‚ÄúThe Lottery,‚Äù for instance.) 

But, and here‚Äôs the weird thing, I think this book is better appreciated as an adult. Younger people are so caught up in the immediacy of every complication. I remember studiously talking about themes before I fully understood them from life. Adults, because we‚Äôve lived through decades, can recognize the patterns of behaviour, the archetypal figures looming behind bullies and visionaries, both in private and public life, that emerge so strikingly in this book.

Finally: why haven‚Äôt I read more William Golding?"

198,Tatiana,The Fault in Our Stars,"Jun 28, 2011",3,"As seen on The Readventurer


The Fault in Our Stars currently has a rating of 4.74 on Goodreads, almost everyone I know has given it 5 stars, therefore I'm certain no one would want to read my sour musings, except me and maybe a couple of other like-minded and unimpressed.

What I'd love to know is this - what makes a writer undertake the topic of cancer? So much has already been written about it, so many Lifetime movies filmed, so many tears shed. It literally has been done to death. What new did John Green have to bring to the cancer table?

The way I see it, nothing. Having your terminally sick characters be ironic about their illnesses and swap cancer jokes isn't groundbreaking.

The Fault in Our Stars isn't a bad book, but it's a standard cancer book, and, sadly, a standard John Green book, with standard John Green humor and standard John Green characters speaking in the very same John Green voice. 

You have a witty and intelligent protagonist (this time 2, Hazel and Augustus - a female and male versions of Miles/Quentin/Colin), a funny, slightly pathetic sidekick (Isaac - another version of Hassan/Chip/Marcus), a mysterious, unhinged girl, Gus's dead ex (Alaska/Margo clone), and, of course, the signature ROAD TRIP. I can't help but recognize these people and this plot, I've read all of Green's novels.

I understand why so many readers would have such an emotional response to the book. Nothing will get the ladies crying quicker than a kid dying of cancer. Add in some long farewells, painkillers, eulogies and funerals - you can collect buckets of tears. But, IMO, here Green aims for the most obvious, the most easily accessible emotions, for the most typical ""life lessons."" And for all Green's attempts to be subversive and to make fun of ""cancer cliches"" - inspirational quotes, heroic cancer survivors, etc. he ended up writing about exactly the same things. 

Frankly, I think The Fault in Our Stars is Green's weakest work to date, weaker even than half-baked Zombicorns. Because this, unlike his earlier works, feels commercial and intentionally tearjerky and insincere. It will probably sell the most copies."
199,Mario the lone bookwolf,Pride and Prejudice,"Mar 07, 2018",5,"The Olympus of protagonist focused classic writing

Austen owned her era
The perfection of this novel is amazing and until today it¬¥s difficult to impossible to name another book that has the same character development, hidden social critique, and amazing characters in a classical setting dealing with the grievances of an epoch. So less action and so much suspense just created by the inner perspective of the main protagonists that it¬¥s a pleasure to read and reread. I just can¬¥t get behind how Austen could write like a goddess and what makes each scene, word, setting, and plot twist so smooth and easy-going, while diving so deep under the skin of this bizarre, ancient society. 

Insider jokes to avoid the censors of the time
What I love about classics is the background, the society, norms and rules, and how the authors integrated, criticized, and commented on the big topics of their time and avoided censorship. Like Twain, London and a handful of other writers Austen has conserved the spirit of those days for eternity, making it a funny, intense, and unique novel.

Evolution of feminist emancipation
It shows how complex women's roles evolved during history and how the immense stupidity of male-made humanities restricted much freedom and human rights and integrated hilarious, epic monuments of facepalmgasms instead. Just irony and satire in their highest form can be used as a mirror to reflect the impressions of a not so far away past, and to be able to laugh instead of sigh about it. If it just was history everywhere.

So much better than most of the male writers of that time
At a time when great writing could just be powered by talent, perseverance, intelligence, exercise, and passion (because there was no creative writing course just around the next corner or online), avoiding conservative worldviews and dogmas of the time, Austen wrote vivid, cliffhangery, and in perfect length with an inherent instinct for the rules of how to make true art. Not like many, mostly male, others, who praised their stupid beliefs in their racist, intolerant, and bad novels, or became pseudointellectual and impossible to understand for mentally healthy readers without narcissistic tendencies to push their ego (here, gratuitously hyped author, take that Nobel prize for that. Again), she wrote literature at it¬¥s best.

Unfounded criticism of her work
I guess that many critics don¬¥t have the time or interest to invest more effort than just reading it without a bit of researching history and the authors' biography to get the full pleasure of all the hidden easter eggs. Without that, it may really seem much more superficial and less well constructed than with the extra knowledge that enables one to enjoy it in full fan mode.

It aged well
Just as a good wine (I don¬¥t like wine, I¬¥m a beer and vodka guy, it¬¥s just about the allegory) classics need time, have to breathe, have to be consumed mindfully and consciously in certain doses, and a bit of decadent study about where the grapes were grown, what meal applies to it, etc. is never a bad idea. Otherwise, they would be indistinguishable from the mass-produced, blockbuster, media-hyped, disposable clone armies of today's literature. The same cheap booze that was already winepressed in each epoch to meet the expectations of ( then bigoted, now too uncritical) readers, that don¬¥t care about the hangover more sophisticated consumers get from mental intoxication. 
That¬¥s of course only true for non favorite genres I¬¥m not (cognitively) biased, and thereby subjectively and emotionally bound, on.

200,"Fergus, Quondam Happy Face",Brave New World,"Aug 05, 2018",3,"Brave New World says as much about Aldous Huxley as it does about our modern world. 

Maybe more.
***

When he wrote it, Huxley was in the process of losing his inner child. Darling of the Jet Set, he was the literary version of their current idol, Cole Porter. 

And in the end, the sophisticated public‚Äôs jaundiced taste for quick, fun and outr√© reads made him disposable - to us all.

And worst of all, to his own deep, dreaming subconscious!

Shy, lanky, shortsighted polymath Huxley was born to a family of Eminent Victorians, and was given ample leisure time to read any book he could get his hands on - which was them all. 

They would call him a nerd nowadays. 

But his reading and shyness disassociated him from the rough-and-tumble world. He had no fixed anchor. 

Like so many of us, he had lost his centre of gravity, or had never had one.

But entre-deux-guerres Europe loved him, and adopted him as one of its own. The darling of the Smart Young Things - as the Catholic Waugh tartly put it - he was witty, caustic and irreverent. 

He could do no wrong - except in the eyes of social activists, on one side, and believers on the other.

So it was at the midpoint of his career that he took up his pen against the future in Brave New World. If he couldn‚Äôt be serious, he could nevertheless shock.

Problem is, he half-loved his own Utopia. And in later life he moved to the U.S.A. and became an early advocate of the Southern California Lifestyle with its casual gurus and myriad conveniences.

When his beloved wife Maria died of cancer, disconsolate and without moorings, he turned to her much younger caregiver for love - a quality conspicuous by the rarity of its occurrence in his hyper-intellectual heart. 

They were married at a no-frills marriage boutique in Nevada. They explored Eastern religions through Vedanta, then a current fad. They attended s√©ances and summoned the ghost of his late wife. But all was not well.

His doctor told him some disturbing news: he was going blind. Losing his sight would be losing his most precious pleasure: reading. So his doctor advised him to frequently rest his eyes, by closing them and then applying light pressure from his palms, gently circling them in a clockwise motion.

He was very much a faddish man without roots, and much akin in his casual though refined nature to the citizens of the Brave New World. He Needed to read and write. He was a sensual man who needed his pleasures.

But with the approach of the sixties, he received another grim diagnosis. Cancer of the mouth. He started to compare notes with his friend Stravinsky about their planned abstinence from cigarettes:

The weeds that killed him in the end.
***

Carl Jung used to say that our Shadow will visit us in our dreams if we ignore it in our daily lives...

Huxley bought into the mainstream Freudian POV that the asceticism of the great mystics was mere dumb sexual repression (witness his Late anti-Christian rant entitled The Devils of Loudon - now made newly available on Kindle).

And late in life, close to the time of his own death, Huxley dreamt he was floating in a vast orb containing a marvellous city. 

But outside the bubble, brutish crowds were howling with derisive laughter at him - yes, him - the untouchable visionary who penned the great Brave New World!

It‚Äôs like that late photo of him at his misunderstood California friend Stravinsky‚Äôs recording sessions for his own new severely serial and segmented short compositions.

Huxley marvelled at the capacious mind of the composer of the Sacre, but his small-souled trivial brain had no clue of the older man‚Äôs unimpeachable moral integrity. 

A wannabe mystic, he was a no-show at the starting gate of Heaven because he could never focus his thoughts long enough to shore up enough justifications for a undying Faith.

He awoke from that dream in a panic.

Poor, dear lost soul that he was, there were times when even Soma wouldn't help...

And in his quest for new utopias, he had left the rough and tumble Faith of ordinary poor workaday, believing sods out of his equation.

For his advanced calculations noisily and brusquely precluded the one and only possible healing panacea for his soul - the Simplicity of the Holy Spirit.

For that‚Äôs ALL he had ever needed, had he understood Stravinsky and the common folk well."

202,Piyangie,The Secret Garden,"Dec 08, 2019",4,"This is a beautiful children's book which somehow, I've missed reading as a child. It is very unfortunate, for I would have been really enchanted by it. The book brought back my childhood memories. My childhood home had a large garden with lots of roses. My mother tended them and I used to help her. When I was a little older (younger than Mary Lennox in Secret Garden), I wanted my own thatch, so I got a nice square corner at one end of the garden with my own tiny garden toolset. Reading the book was really a nostalgic journey.

The story of The Secret Garden is an inspirational one for the children. It tells you how two disagreeable children become lovable, pleasant, and healthy. How does this happen? By the magic of course! - The magic of the garden, the magic of nature. We all know the healing power of nature. It is the best medicine for all our ailments. It soothes and cures our soul, and through the soul, the body, the way it did for Mary ‚Äúquite contrary‚Äù and Colin the ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù. 

The story is well written that I could picture almost all the characters - Mary, Colin, Dickon (oh I loved him) Mrs. Sowerby, and Captain, Soot, Nut and Shell, and all the troupe of Dickon. And the best and the biggest and the most important character is the secret garden itself. I really enjoyed the author's descriptive accounts of the garden and the Yorkshire moorland. It was so refreshing. I could almost swear that I breathed the same fresh air which Mary, Colin, and Dickon breathed, all through the read. 

This is the second book I've read of Burnett, first being  A Little Princess , which was a childhood favorite of mine. I really like the way she tells her stories. It is bewitching. I didn't really think I would enjoy a children's story this much in my mature years, but it was impossible not to enjoy it. Her writing is so good. She is one of the best children story writers. There is not an atom of doubt there."
203,Cheyenne,The Catcher in the Rye,"Aug 04, 2007",1,"Edit: stop liking and commenting on this review. It's 2021. And the book is still shit.

If I could give this book a zero, I would. I absolutely hated it. Generally, I don't hate books, either. Usually it's a very strong dislike, and generally, I give them a second chance. But no, I will never be reading this book again.

In my opinion, Holden is the worst character in the English language. Salinger tried just too damn hard to make him 'universal', to the point where he becomes unrealistic. His train of thought is annoying and repetitive, and God, those catchphrases of his. Can someone shut this kid up? Holden is almost the anti-Gary Stu. Nearly every thing's wrong with him. The one good thing about him being his love for his younger sister. 

The plot is one of the worst I've ever read. It's boring, and it, like Holden, is unbelievably and painfully repetitive. Holden calls up an old friend, has a drink. Holden calls up a girl, has a drink. Holden dances with a girl. Then he drinks. Was there a climax to this book? I must have missed it. Maybe it was Holden nearly freezing to death (um, what?) in Central Park? No, no, maybe it was when Holden called up that hooker! Maybe not. The plot is so fuzzy and flat I couldn't tell when to peak my interest.

And that's just it, it never did.

So buh-bye, Holden! Your book's been gathering dust on my shelf for the past two years and it'll stay that way. Until I decide to sell it, of course."
204,Lyn,Fahrenheit 451,"Jul 30, 2011",5,"Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a novel that transcends it's dystopian theme and delivers its cautionary message in a timeless fashion, what made this story compelling in 1953 remains provocative. 

It is a strident call to arms, a warning siren of darkness always on the perimeter.

Critics have tried to make more of this, and certainly it is an archetypal work, but I think its simplicity is its great strength - it is fundamentally about book burning, literally and metaphorically. A powerful allegory that also works well as a prima facie argument against censorship and a good science fiction novel all by itself.
 
Bradbury has stated that the novel is not about censorship, but a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature, which leads to a perception of knowledge as being composed of factoids, partial information devoid of context - and I can see that (and in an age of Vine and Twitter this message is all too relevant), but for me the image of the ironic fireman burning books is the endearing story.

This is a book that everyone should read at least once.

**** 2021 reread - 

This could be an annual reread, I was again captivated by Bradbury's language and vision.

Akin to Orwell's 1984 in its cautionary dystopia, this is more fantastic and serves best as allegory for complacency, conformism and the deterioration of critical thought. A reader of both classics may also draw a comparison between 1984's O'Brien and 451's Beatty. Both antagonists, like Milton's Satan, recognize the evil of their design but move forward regardless and with a recklessness born of misanthropy. 

One symbol that was ubiquitous in the novel was that of hands. Montag blames his hands for beginning his treason by taking books and later it is his hands that commits the murders, and still later, by contrast, Guy thinks of hands as building and creating rather than burning and destroying. 

*** 2023 reread - 

Still an excellent book, timeless in its message, and as relevant as ever.

I noticed in my reread of Childhood's End and Foundation, all three books published within years of each other, and significantly only a few years removed from battling global fascism, that all three of these SF masterpieces address a dehumanizing effect of authority and technology.

This time I paid close attention to Montag's relationships with the other characters. From his wife, to Clarisse, to Beatty, and then to Faber and the disenfranchised hobos, Montag is our guide for the dystopia he lives through as well as the scenes of hope and for the final denouement. 

Bradbury's prose is a treasure."
205,Meredith Holley,The Help,"Apr 30, 2010",0,"I have this terrible, dreary feeling in my diaphragm area this morning, and I‚Äôm not positive what it‚Äôs about, but I blame some of it on this book, which I am not going to finish. I have a friend who is mad at me right now for liking stupid stuff, but the thing is that I do like stupid stuff sometimes, and I think it would be really boring to only like smart things. What I don‚Äôt like is when smart (or even middle-brained) writers take an important topic and make it petty through guessing about what they don‚Äôt know. I can list you any number of these writers who would be fine if they weren't reaching into topics about which they have no personal experience (incidentally, all writers I'm pretty sure my angry friend loves. For example, The Lovely Bones, The Kite Runner, Water for Elephants, Memoirs of a Geisha, etc.). These are the books for which I have no patience, topics that maybe someone with more imagination or self-awareness could have written about compassionately, without exploiting the victimization of the characters. They‚Äôre books that hide lazy writing behind a topic you can‚Äôt criticize. The Help is one of these.

You‚Äôve got this narrative telephone game in this book. The telephone game is pretty fun sometimes, and it is really beautiful in monster stories like Frankenstein and Wuthering Heights because what they are telling me is not intended as trustworthy or earnest. All of the seriousness in monster stories is an impression or an emotion reflected back through the layers of narrative. I don‚Äôt feel that way about the topic of The Help, though. In this book, a white woman writes from the point of view of a black woman during the Civil Rights movement, who overhears the conversations of white women. It's an important topic, and I don't want to hear it through untrustworthy narrators.

So, I can basically get on board with the dialect of the black maids, but what throws me off as a reader is when the black maid is quoting the white women and they‚Äôre all speaking perfect English without a trace of an accent. It becomes particularly weird when one of the black maids starts to comment on the extreme accent of one of the white women, Celia Foote, whose written dialogue continues to be impeccable. Who is this narrator? Why does she choose not to speak proper English if she can speak it? Why does she choose to give proper English to someone else who she has told me doesn't speak it? Also, usually the layers of narration in a telephone-game book are only within the book. In this case, it‚Äôs the author‚Äôs voice stabbing through the story. I am convinced it is her whose brain hears the white woman speaking TV English, and the black women speaking in dialect. It gives away the game. 

Even the quotes from the movie have an example of this. A conversation between her and Minnie goes like this:

Celia Foote: They don't like me because of what they think I did.
Minny Jackson: They don't like you 'cause they think you white trash. 

Celia speaks in a proper sentence, but Minny misses the ""are"" in the second part of the sentence. Celia says ""because,"" but Minny says ""'cause."" If the reader were supposed to understand that Celia does not speak in dialect, that would make sense, but since it specifically states that she does, it doesn't make sense.

To attempt to be clear, I didn't have a problem that the book was in dialect. I had a problem that the book said, ""This white woman speaks in an extreme dialect,"" and then wrote the woman's dialog not in dialect. Aerin points out in message 111 that I am talking about eye dialect, which is about spelling, not pronunciation, as in the example above. Everyone, in real life, speaks in some form of non-standard English. Though I have seen some really beautiful uses of eye dialect, as Aerin points out, writers typically use it to show subservience of characters or that they are uneducated, which often has racist overtones. If it troubles you that I'm saying this, and you would like to comment on this thread, you may want to read other comments because it is likely someone has already said what you are going to say.

I‚Äôm not finishing this one, and it‚Äôs not because I think people shouldn‚Äôt like it, but rather because I‚Äôm almost 100 pages in and I can see the end, and it‚Äôs failed to engage me. When a few IRL friends have asked what I thought of the book and I said I didn't care for it, they have told me that I am taking it too seriously, that it is just a silly, fluff book, not a serious study of Civil Rights. Again, I don‚Äôt have a problem with stupid books, but when it‚Äôs a stupid book disguised as an Important Work of Cultural History, all I want to do the whole time is tear its mask off. And a book about Civil Rights is always important cultural history to me. Anyway, the book becomes unpleasant; I become unpleasant; it‚Äôs bad news. If you loved this book, though, (or, really, even if you hated it) I would recommend Coming of Age in Mississippi. I think that book is one of the more important records of American history. Plus, it‚Äôs beautifully written, inspirational, and shocking. It's been years since I read it, so I might be giving it an undeserved halo, but I can‚Äôt say enough good things about it.

Dear Charlie,

I am writing to you because I feel like you're the only one that would listen to me right now. From all the friends that I have made you are the one that's the most understanding. I guess what I'm trying to do is thank you for being there for me these last couple of days. I didn't expect to learn from you as much as I have. My mom always says that you can never really understand a person until you walk in their shoes, but I guess getting to know you and reading your story did just that. I have to say you have stripped me from any prejudice I might have had. And I am truly sorry if I had any. You showed me that no matter what happens, what we experience, we always have a right to feel the way we feel, just because. You showed me the purity of feelings, beauty of thoughts, generosity of love and warmth of friendship. You made me appreciate books and poetry more, and see the impact they have on people's lives. For that you will always hold a special place in my heart. I'd like to think that you get better, I hope one day you can be honest with people you love, be who you really are and do what you want to do. Most importantly I hope that you will love the real Sam and not just the idea of her and be ready for her to love you back. I hope we can see each other some day, I'll make sure to come back and remind myself of everything that is you, tho I hope to never forget.

 
 Love always 
 Karolina"
207,Jesse,Ender's Game ,"Jul 28, 2023",5,"If history has taught us anything, its that no one turns out for the better when the government experiments on them. There's no way Ender doesn't end up killing himself, becoming a raging alcoholic, or maybe addicted to some futuristic space drug. There's no way he turns out normal. Maybe the future has some kind of cure for massive childhood trauma and PTSD caused by government experimentation on childeren....let's hope that's the case. 

 Governmental overreach for the ""greater good."" Breeding super childered to fight battles for you. Winning at all costs. Damn the torpedoes. It's 1984 meets Starship Troppers and War of the worlds. 

 The writing left a little to be disired, its simplistic, dialog driven, and repetitive.¬† There's next to zero character development. Everyone is pretty one dimensiononal. It's predictable and kinda weird. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, I mean, it's good guys verse bad guys, in space, with a child prodigy and aliens. 

 It was simple and didn't require too much attention or investment, but sometimes that's what you need in a read."
208,Matthew,A Game of Thrones ,"Jan 24, 2018",4,"I have finally done it! I have joined in on the fun that is A Game of Thrones. It is 2018 and I managed to make it all the way here without reading a page or watching a minute of the show. Now, it is the nature of the internet to keep me from being completely in the dark on this one, but I think I did a pretty good job of avoiding hearing or seeing too much about it. 

Is this a great fantasy book? It really is quite good. The plot and the characters are well thought out. Comparing it to other fantasy books I have read, it is right up there or better.

Yeah, but since this has been taking the world by storm it must have blown your socks off!? Um, no, not really. It was good, but not, ""OMG THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!"" good.

How about mainstream interest? So many people say they are not fantasy fans but they love this series. This has to be 95% because of the show. This book is SOOOOOOO fantasy, if it wasn't already popular I would never recommend it to anyone except a diehard fantasy fan. In fact, it isn't even really ""fun"" fantasy - it is dark with lots of politics and plotting. Some of my Goodreads friends said that historical fiction fans get a kick out of it, too, and it is loosely based on the War of the Roses.

Do I want to watch the show now? Yeah, I think I will check it out.

Sex and violence?  I have seen some people wary of this book because of sex and violence. Internet spoilers, SNL skits, etc. sure do make it sound pretty vicious and risque. However, compared to other fantasy novels, it is pretty normal. In fact, the depiction of sex is pretty tame. Violence is maybe a little more intense, but nothing that made me feel the book was too extremely brutal. Perhaps these things get amped up in future books?

EVERONE DIES! One thing that seemed to leak through the internet and my friends talking about the book was to not get too attached to a character because they will probably die. So far, only one death was kind of shocking to me. I expect the death count and the shock value to go up as the books progress.

I think that covers the main points. 
- I liked it, but wasn't completely blown away. 
- I have no idea how HBO managed to get a bunch of non-fantasy fans into this. 
- I cannot wait to check out the next one to see what happens!"

~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~

Every year this series invites me in and I can practically hear it saying to me- 

 Insert Edward's voice - 
""I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? 
As if you could outrun me. 
As if you could fight me off.""  

And well I don't fight it off. 

Jokes aside, this book is imperfect. But it still continues to be a masterpiece, in the sense I never get bored or tired of it. Each time I read this series, it's like falling in love with Forks and the characters all over again. It's good to be nostalgic once in a while, isn't it? It's such a comfort read."

I cried, I laughed, and I fell in love.

I grew up watching these movies because my mom just absolutely loves them but I've never really been that interested in reading the book. I knew I'd read it someday but it wasn't a top priority at all. I had to read this for my can lit course this semester and boy am I ever glad for that. I absolutely adored this story. Anne is such a darling and she just makes me look at the world differently and want to use my imagination more, she makes me feel like a kid again. I loved all the characters and the writing was fantastic. The ending just made me want to read the rest of the series! LOVED IT!"
213,Jana,The Hunger Games ,"May 05, 2010",1,"A lot of things are troubling me about The Hunger Games. A lot of things which I more and more perceive and which are not solely connected with this book but with the metaphor behind the words. People attach themselves to fictional freedom without seeing what really something is and which unfortunately is here to stay because you can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. You can‚Äôt make a shift on a deeper level, if the only thing that attracts you to this book is ‚Äì a vision of fight, retaliation and the outcome of freedom. Freedom of flesh. 

In comparison to the freedom of and from your mind which is nowhere to be found. 

And this is why I detest this book, although detest is such a strong from the ego word. Because the whole purpose of this story is to show how people shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice their children for the better of their communities and with the positive outcomes realise that we are so much stronger and yada yada. 

THE WHOLE PURPOSE of this book should be that there shouldn‚Äôt even be in the first place a need to sacrifice members of our society for some other people to be amused. And where after the battle of ''united'' people we heal and repair the damages for the better tomorrow. The society cancer of western civilisation thinking. 

Heal the damage, never heal the cause of it. 

But then we wouldn‚Äôt be talking here about the same book. We would be discussing how humanity can help each other with being better, with taking responsibility and with being open to each other. 

And yet imagine this paradox we live in: better, as if the majority of population can even understand that we are in constant blood thirst to achieve peace. With war comes peace. While along the way we are trying to be better and safer. Yet most people deliberately choose to live on the utmost lowest level of their existence. In fear, frightened of itself.

And people read books which are so extreme in their bullshit. And people connect with Katniss because she is the heroine. She has managed to outsmart the system. Instead of thinking that she was not even supposed be there in the first place. Because we live in society that does this to their children. 

''No, we don‚Äôt!''

''We do...''

''But children can learn how to fight.''

''You teach them to fight for individual puppeteers. And instead of working on yourself, how to achieve your inner peace, you associate yourself again with the group because it feels better to be in the tortured crowd, instead of being alone and awakened.''

''What are you talking about? It is just emo gibberish. Leave Katniss alone. And in the end, it is just a book. Why don‚Äôt you want people to read and educate themselves, does everything have to be deep and meaningful, can‚Äôt you just relax?''

Yes, everything has to be deep and meaningful since we are drowning in shit of meaningless and shallow. The system as it is, the plot of this book is just another evidence to show us how we are controlled. That we are left barren from our true selves which we only find in empathy, love towards each other and genuinely understanding that we are one and everything is one. But on this provincial&marginal&primitive&emotional level, so many took this book for granted. 

And the only reason I am writing this review here, the only reason I am giving it so much attention is to tell what is on my mind since it is so widely popular and since I have read it. And one of the main reasons why I can‚Äôt really keep things light and popsy is because so many things are already deep down in gutter light and popsy and mainstream. As if having money is any critieria for life, as if not having your own free will and education and information means nothing. And the other side of the rich coin is poverty with people who believe in symbols, who are sidetracked with religions, censured TV, economy and utter lack of information circulation. 

And a lot of people here are trying to disregard this review and want to reassure me that I am so terribly wrong. BUT, you have yet not seen what I am talking about and it is perfectly OK. 

So I followed as well screaming Goodreads recommendations and I bought a book that is stupid, violent and written so plainly but of course written for vast masses so they can be touched by fake social awareness. Because it is fake, but most of all it‚Äôs tragic. 

And this is not a critique toward Collins, in my nature of a thinker and seeing her a person who shared her thoughts and which millions of people loved and connected with, I am still a firm believer that the general public just didn‚Äôt understand what she was talking about. And this is my silver lining. Because it has been like this throughout centuries and with the biggest thinkers of our civilisation. What they meant and wanted to show, is definitely not what most of the public projected. 

Because the mainstream public is a group of sheep, not seeing anything properly, but following and like a Tarzan, screaming, don‚Äôt you dare stealing my Jane from me. As a metaphor, don‚Äôt you dare telling me these uplifting emotions are not true, when all in me about this book tells me that is correct and how people should live their lives. 

And if the mainstream likes it, uh, then definitely that is not what it‚Äôs true. 

It is just a constant reminder how so many things are left unrecognised while these superficial stories which evoke cheap emotions are always so hugely praised. It could have been just a little story but never underestimate the obese octopus that is called In God And Country We Trust - code red mentality. Mentality of humans which are too ignorant, beautifully naive and untouched basically with what is means to be socially aware. 

And although this is a teen book, it is more deeply hurting and sickening because if you want to influence somebody, of course you will influence the children ‚Äì and yet there is nothing that children can learn from it. They can learn some things, we all need little courageous Katniss, but on a deeper subtler level is it just an intravenous injection of more Nothing and more Numbing and more Disconnected. 

At least they read is one of the arguments. And argument as fruitfull as at least they eat GMO food. One food for the blind intellect, other for the digestion which both results in basic survival without any interference of you in all of it. Because it takes courage and guts and a pinch of anarchy to stop, turn around and start questioning what is handed. 

For me, the thought about giving this to a child is sickening especially because we live in this world where all the life criterias are upside down. Because a child will not learn how things are vile and disturbing because Katniss told them through her delusional and hyperventilating focus, but a child will learn about life‚Äôs cruelty, and it will be touched by it sooner or later, by questioning everything that is served in front of it. 

Because if it is served somebody is earning money and you are just getting fatter and sicker. 

And the children will learn how to question if you teach them how to find not if you broadcast them the answers. Not if you teach them through aggressive examples and if you keep the nation in cold sweat especially if you are lucky enough to live in the countries where oppression is not the issue but consumerism, body image and mediocrity have you on the leash. 

I am astonished with a fact that around 75.000 Goodreads members read this book and that around 50.000 of them rated it 5 stars. What is it that fascinates them so much. 

It‚Äôs disturbing because people obviously associate and find themselves in this book. And it's about a girl Katniss Everdeen, living in the far away future, who was chosen to participate in a cruel Big Brother game, in which 24 contestants (children age 12-18) kill each other, because live TV has become demanding, and the public loves reality blood and violence. That's it. A little bit of undeveloped and unbelievable romance between her and two boys, a little bit of her abandoned family problems, a little bit of The 5th element movie political structure, mutants and pop stylists. It‚Äôs so screwed up. 

In the beginning, first 50 pages were well written. There was suspense, Katniss was sweet and witty, but overall this book is a shitty meltdown. Adding the ridiculous cliffhanger ending. Some people here are using words like dystopian literature, and then write essays about how this book is the core of it. 

The core is pointlessly graphic and sadistic, without any concrete message except of the negative: this book is just proving that the world today is fucked up if this book is so successful. I don‚Äôt see the point of reading about the fictional kids who are doing this to each other. 

In a metaphorical way it is promoting political establishments of certain countries and that is getting tiring. Not all people are eager to swallow the shit of general brainwashing. Katniss being the heroine (ironical quote marks). Being loyal and darling and a role model. Just wake up. Life is happening and some pretty dark things are happening while you are thinking that Katniss is the representative of the club called liberation. 

For me, in a bookish way it stands for one bad one night stand, kiss and forget. But as always, readers tend to bring fiction to their real life and just as many think that kittens and superheroes are comfort zones, a lot of readers perceive this plot as their own little shrine. 

But that is me not being in tune with the mainstream population which is too distracted with billboards. 

Because it is easier, because why protest, why not simply take what you are given - eat your GMO Monsanto's company hamburgers, eat your cancer giving Nestle products and think that The Hunger Games are the best franchise ever, like ever. If you don't have any arguments about real life activism and if you think that there is deepness in this plot which I have yet not seen so you need to enlightened me, just include North Korea or Hitler or ISIS(L) or those poor people who are closed in Zara hangers who work nonstop ''somewhere'' in the world because obviously you are aware of the crisis although you don‚Äôt think you could show on the map but you have heard somewhere on Murdoch media. 

This shit sells. It's genuinely bad but excellently targeted. You know, it evokes pride and loyalty and massacring children, freedom and scandal and Hollywood. It goes very well with all the Kardashian filth. As long as it sells, sells, sells. And marketing agencies know that people are united when they are jealous, when they want and they with those hamburgers want freedom. Nobody is going to kill their Katniss in a goddam book! Really? Take a look around you. 

And then the punch line for this book comes from the so called activism from the shopping mall. People who devour literature of this kind and think that everything is all right while in the same time, fuck, you are getting oozingly fat. 

Bottom line.

This book is very shallow and MTV culture oriented, like a classical example of easy consummated pop-literature; I'm very surprised that it didn't come with some trash magazine subscription. If it doesn't have savage brutality, prize money and prefix ''media coverage'' then it won't be appealing and educational because surely this is how children of 21st century survive this techno media world; through examples of true moral issues and realistic outcomes. Have another gulp of Coca-Cola along the way while you listen to dubstep shit. 

It saddens me when a violent hillbillish book is so popular. What is there to truly identify yourself with. Except if your chicken soup for soul are basic emotions which come with buy 1 get 1 free."
214,K.D. Absolutely,The Fault in Our Stars,"May 16, 2013",1,"I can be honest, right? After all, it was I who spent time reading this book.

I guess it has something to do with the fact that so many friends and relatives raved about this book being sad and great prior to my reading. For example, an 8-year old niece of my wife said that she cried while reading the book because it is about teenagers with cancer. Then of course most of my GR friends, foreigners and locals alike, rated this book with either 4 or 5 stars.

So, when I started reading this book, I thought I already clammed up. Maybe I was just trying to be different or I would like to show my wife's 8-y/o niece that the book is YA and I am too old (mature) compared to her and have outgrown books like this and definitely would not cry over some silly stories about lovers with cancer.

My Dad died of brain cancer in 1997 so definitely I have a big compassion for people suffering from any kind of cancer. However, what is John Green's purpose of using cancer has a major element in this book's romance? Obviously, it is to manipulate people's emotion. It is to gain sympathy because his female readers would like to cry buckets of tears especially if the guy is as good-looking as Augustus the apple of the eyes of our heroine who is also cancer-stricken, Hazel. I mean cancer, like death, is something that we normally don't want to talk about and if we need to talk about it, we usually have a purpose. Sadly, in my opinion, John Green has no particular purpose but for commercial reason: to generate sympathy that means more readers, more sales, more money to bring to the bank.

There is nothing new in this book. Hazel's I want to leave a mark prior to dying is everybody's wish really. Augustus' I am not my cancer is too heroic. We all know that it is not true, we all got our big frustrations or lost in lives. We all have been sick at some point in our lives and we go through a period of denial and even if we say we accepted everything, we always keep on hoping that the sickness or the problem would disappear that's why we continuously pray to God. I mean the acceptance is there and we are at peace with ourselves but still call God to interfere and take the sickness away. 

I just did not feel anything reading this book except the feeling of being manipulated. It's too pretentious and gimmicky. I know John Green is laughing his way to the bank especially because some movie people took advantage of this book's popularity so this even has a big screen adaptation. My goodness."
215,Calista,The Giving Tree,"Apr 15, 2015",5,"I have always loved this book. AS youth we even acted it out as a skit with four people playing the tree. 

Last year, I read someone memoir and they hated this book and talked about how unhealthy the premise is. Giving all you have to someone that leaves you until there is nothing left. There are no healthy boundaries here. I can see it from this side and the other side. It bring out many different arguments which is what art is supposed to do. I have to say, I still love the story, I'm am more conscious around it now."
216,Tatiana,The Help,"Mar 22, 2010",1,"I don't think this could be any more obvious, trite and cliche-ridden. The book's only aim is to make white people feel better about themselves (you know, that same old a-brave-white-lady-savior story you've read and a few dozen times before). Guess it worked. Again."
217,Cecily,The Hunger Games ,"Jun 17, 2011",2,"I read this when it was first published, ordering it before I knew it was YA, and years before any films (which I've not seen). If I were a teenager or recommending this to a teen, I might give it 3*; as an adult, I give it 2*.

PLOT

It's a potentially exciting but gruesome story, but most of the characters were rather flat, and much of the plot was predictable, partly because it's not hugely original. See Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, which I reviewed HERE, and the Japanese Battle Royale. Furthermore, there were too many flaws in the plot. I fail to understand its very high ratings.

Post-apocalyptic America (Panem) is divided into a wealthy and technologically advanced Capitol and twelve subsidiary districts of oppressed people who exist in dire poverty, with inadequate food, housing, and health care and hardly any technology. To reinforce the power of the Capitol by instilling fear in the population, once a year, two children from each region are selected by lots to fight to the death in a reality show. If that were not bad enough, the whole thing is utterly corrupt in multiple ways, plus the public bet on the outcome, and sponsors can sway the results. Did I mention these are children? (Some are as young as 12, though the narrator is 16.) A compulsory full-body wax on a teen seems rather pervy and who would want to bet on, let alone sponsor a child-killing tournament, even if it's by helping one of the contestants? As the book keeps reminding readers, one person's survival is only possible by the death of all the others.

CRUELTY TO CHILDREN

I realise that horrendous things are done to children around the world every day (extreme poverty, child soldiers, sexual assault, genital mutilation etc), but in none of those cases is the sole intention that all but one child dies, and nor is it organised by the government for a sick combination of sport, entertainment, punishment and profit. 

Humans often lack compassion, but I was never convinced by Collins' world - especially the fact this outrage has continued for three generations (it's the 74th games), apparently without the Capitol even needing to invoke gods or supernatural powers to justify their cruelty! Could a barbaric annual tournament really be such a powerful incentive not to rise up in all that time? (I don't think so.)

BIG ISSUES

Nevertheless, it tackles some big themes that are particularly pertinent to teens: the nature of friendship; divided loyalties; the difference between love and friendship; who to trust; whether the ends justify the means; the need to repay favours; the danger of power, wealth and celebrity; the corrupting influence of reality TV; the need for independence, and whether you can trust a parent who abandons you. 

It all feels rather laboured to me, but it might not if I were a teen, which only reinforces my puzzlement at the number of adults who have enjoyed it. I must be missing something.

NARRATIVE STRUCTURE 

Nearly half the book is backstory and preparation for the games; the remainder is a tale of hunter and hunted. I predicted the main plot twist less than a quarter of the way in (and the fact that Katniss is telling the story limits the possible outcomes), but the suspense was broken when it was made explicit way before the end. There are some other twists between then and the final page, but by then I was rather annoyed with the whole thing.

IMPLAUSIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCIES

If I'd enjoyed the book more, I would have found it easier to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, I was constantly irked by questions and inconsistencies. 

* The contestants (and their parents and grandparents) have been forced to watch the games every year of their lives. I suppose they had become inured to it, but on the other hand, that meant they knew the horror of it. I just didn't believe there was as little fear in them as there appeared to be - given that they are children. 
* Participants don't want other participants to know where they are, yet sponsor gifts occasionally drop out of the sky, via silver parachute; not a risk, apparently. 
* It's all filmed by numerous invisible floating cameras (I can buy that), but that somehow includes filming inside a cave that is virtually sealed (I can't). 
* How (and why) would any of these participants be able to measure time to within half hour intervals?
* How big is Panem? It can only be a tiny part of the USA because each district specialises in only one thing (coal mining, agriculture etc) and has just one town square that can accommodate everyone (8,000 people in District 12) and yet it's a day's train journey from District 12 to the Capitol. It doesn't seem like a very plausible settlement pattern in a post-disaster world, even given the totalitarian regime (concentrating people in a few centres makes it easier to observe and perhaps control them, but it also creates more opportunities for opposition movements to develop).

COMPARED WITH LORD OF THE FLIES

There are some similarities with ""Lord of the Flies"" (my review here: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...), but although ""The Hunger Games"" is likely to have more appeal to modern teens, I think there are (at least) two crucial differences:

* In LotF one person's survival is not necessarily at the cost of everyone else's. (It is even possible that they could all survive.)

* LotF has much more depth and symbolism: it tackles original sin; the mystical ""Beast""; leadership, tribal allegiance and group dynamics (including bullying and attitudes to difference and minor disability) and the importance of ritual and belief.

The second point is what makes LotF a better book, in my opinion. 

Of course, there are other, more obvious, parallels with extreme ""reality"" shows such as ""Survivor"" and ""I'm a Celebrity, get me out of here"", but the fundamental differences are not just that contestants in those shows do not fear for their lives, but that they are adults who have chosen to enter. 

I TRIED TO ENJOY IT!

Any fans who read this will now hate me. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I read it all the way through, making notes as usual, but to no avail. Sorry."
218,Anne,Pride and Prejudice: an Annotated Edition,"Feb 25, 2008",5,"Critics who consider Austen's works trivial because of their rigid, upper-class setting, wealthy characters, domestic, mannered plots and happy endings are almost totally disconnected from reality, as far as I can tell. What can they possibly expect an upper-middle class English woman to write about in 1813 but what she knows or can imagine? Sci-fi? A history of the American Revolution? A real-life expos√© of underage exploitation in the garment district of London? Come on. What other setting can she be expected to tackle with authority? Austen's value lies in her portraiture: her characters are believably human in their concerns, vanities, failings and quirks. The plots serve largely to showcase their interaction and thus, her observations of human nature, which are pointed, accurate, and hysterical. 

Here, in her best work (my opinion), her technical skill as a writer also shows in Pride and Prejudice's tight plotting and economical casting; there are no superfluous characters or wasted chapters here. My college lit professor used to go on and on about this novel as a revolution of literary form in that dialogue drives the plot as much as exposition; I'll buy that but it doesn't thrill me for its own sake as much as it did her. It does mean, though, that Pride and Prejudice is a relatively smooth and lively read, that we learn about events and characters as much from what they say to each other as from what Austen narrates to us. The banter between Darcy and Elizabeth isn't empty flirting, it's a progression, a chart of their ongoing understanding/misunderstanding and a way to take stock of plot developments as well as an enjoyable display of wit. 

Austen's heroines are famously caught between love and money are famously criticized for always getting both in the end. I've got no problem with this wish fulfillment. Keep in mind that being married is basically the only possible 'job' available to a woman of her position--marrying a rich dude is the only viable escape from the life of poor-relation dependency Austen herself lived, there's nothing reactionary or anti-feminist about it. The other option--becoming a governess--is barely respectable, putting a woman into an ambiguous class limbo of social invisibility that translates directly into a loss of safety and self-governance. Expecting Elizabeth to, what, become a doctor? is silly and anachronistic, and perhaps if that's your preference you'd be better off reading Clan of the Cave Bear, with Ayla and her bearskin bra, or what have you. 

Pride and Prejudice is simply a joy to read, a dance of manners and affection between the leads and a parade of human silliness in the supporting cast. 

edited to add: some thoughts specific to the Patricia Meyer Spacks annotated edition I received as a gift for Christmas 2010:

It‚Äôs quite remarkably handsome, and sturdy, and useful for whacking spiders if you are that sort of person. Generously illustrated with color and black-and-white sketches, engravings, and reproductions of earlier editions, household objects, relevant artwork, contemporary cartoons, diagrams and fashion plates.

My attention wandered during the editor‚Äôs introduction in what turned out to be a horribly familiar way. While I appreciated Spacks‚Äôs discussion of historical background, her warnings about the subtlety of language and characterization, and the dangers of identifying too much with our favorite characters because Austen stacks the deck for that purpose, etc etc, it was a sort of technical appreciation--dry, and a little bit soulless. I was, perhaps, impatient. At some point as I yanked my eyes back to the pages I kept trying to read, I realized: Spacks is a Professor Emerita at the University of Virginia--my former stomping grounds (wahoo-wa!) (...sorry, that happens)--it‚Äôs more than possible she was MY professor back in 19. I don‚Äôt remember her name or face, but certainly her style, the steel trap of her mind, and the mildly pushy feeling of her obsession with language all felt very very familiar. So, grain of salt: I may have some kind of baggage here.

That said, this is a must-own for the serious P&P fan. As with any annotated edition, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a first or even third reading of the book--these notes take up half-to-full pages, sometimes continuing to the next, and only if you‚Äôre already familiar with the text of the book itself can you spare attention to wander off down these other roads. Keep another straight copy of P&P around for when you just want to read the thing. Some footnotes are simple definitions, or style notes: some are mini-essays that include their own cited references. Spacks includes centuries of Austen scholarship in her notes, not just contemporaries, so points of view vary widely. There‚Äôs quite a smorgasbord of textual commentary to pick through, and you‚Äôre sure to find little tidbits that strike you as especially resonant or horrendously wrong and weird. 

Two tidbits I liked: first, a primary source. One note, in discussing the complicated British class system of the day, refers to a table constructed by one Patrick Colquhoun in his A Treatise on the Wealth, Power and Resources of the British Empire, in Every Quarter of the World (2nd ed., London, 1815, pp 106-107)--a table which lays out exactly where, for instance, Darcy stands in relation to the Bennett family. He‚Äôs in the ‚Äúsecond class,‚Äù they‚Äôre in the fourth. Clearly people put a lot of time and effort into codifying and arguing about societal structure, status and behavior, and I think that would be a fascinating thing to read. 

Another note I lingered over involves Mr. Collins, a character we love to hate. Here's the upside of an annotated edition: I‚Äôd never bothered to give Mr Collins much of my attention, since he‚Äôs icky--but Spacks points out the oddity of a snippet that I'd always ignored before. In bidding Elizabeth farewell from Hunsford, Mr Collins apologizes profusely for the humbleness of his style of living, as if he considered her socially above him--and this is a complete 180 from his incredibly condescending proposal of marriage earlier in the book, where he deigns to presume he‚Äôs taking a burden from her parents by opting to support her. Also, Spacks has a lot to say about Elizabeth's inconsistency and lack of generosity towards Charlotte Lucas--traits I'd noticed in past readings without following through to some of their logical conclusions and their connections with Elizabeth's later behavior.

Definitely worth the purchase price! Add it to your collection, but don't make it your only copy, since it's hard to tuck under your pillow."

220,K,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Sep 13, 2008",2,"To my editor:

Khaled here. As I was reviewing my final draft of ‚ÄúA Thousand Splendid Suns,‚Äù some questions occurred to me.

1. Could I make the characters any less complex? Despite my efforts, I feel I haven‚Äôt fully achieved the one-dimensionality my readers seemed to love in ‚ÄúThe Kite Runner.‚Äù Specifically, I‚Äôm afraid I may have given Rassan one or two potentially sympathetic moments early on despite his overall abusive personality (although I more than make up for it). I don‚Äôt know whether my readers can handle that level of complexity. Fortunately, aside from that minor lapse with Rassan, I think I managed to keep my characters and their relationships pretty simplistic, although there‚Äôs always room for improvement in that regard!

2. Do you think I included enough graphic violent scenes, or should I add another ten or so?

3. Are my characters stereotypical enough?

4. Pretty clever the way I stuffed the facts of recent Afghani history into my characters‚Äô dialogue whenever I could, don‚Äôtcha think?

5. Speaking of dialogue, I‚Äôm wondering whether I can inject a little more of my agenda into the characters‚Äô conversation or introspection, or maybe structure the plot around it a little more. Any ideas?

6. Isn‚Äôt it great that Afghanistan is such a hot topic that mediocre writers like me can make a buck by pandering to people‚Äôs intellectual pretensions?

With hopes for another bestseller, 
Khaled"

Percy Jackson is a spunky teenage boy attending Yancy Academy. His life turning upside down when during a school trip to a museum he is attacked and nearly killed by a harpy. Not every day you realize you are the illegitimate son of a god and that you are being hunted down by mythological monsters. What follows is a narrow escape to Camp Half Blood, home and refuge for all the unrecognized offspring of the many Olympus deities. Things do not get better when he realizes his birth signifies the violation of a sacred millennial oath, gets accused for stealing the thunder of Zeus, and the possibility of a full scale heavenly war escalating to a point of no return. 

2014 was the best year of my young reader‚Äôs life. Bought a tablet, discovered Goodreads, and with it an endless sea of possibilities and books I never knew existed. That year I devoured all the Giver, Hunger Games and Divergent series one after the other, but Percy Jackson was my very first.

I just loved Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Sally. Hated so much Gabe! And Clarisse, at least at the beginning. I was completely enamored by the world building and all of its fantastic characters, the greek mythology references, the never ending reveals, the engrossing story progression, and the nonstop action. This book was unmatched YA heaven. How can I ever forget Camp Half Blood, the Lotus Casino, the fights against so many mythological figures like the Minotaur, the Furies, Medusa, Echidna, Chimera, Ares, Cerberus... So many endearing and heartbreaking moments to remember by (view spoiler)[ The Minotaur and the Pearl scenes!  (hide spoiler)]. The big ending reveal (view spoiler)[with Luke (hide spoiler)] was kind of a letdown, but a very decent ending nonetheless. And hey, what book is perfect? It was so close though! A terrific beginning for one of my most beloved fantasy series ever. Highly Recommendable for YA Fantasy lovers, and adults with a child at heart.

*** The movie (2010) was a joke and one of the most disappointing adaptations I've ever watched. I mean it was so awkwardly filmed! The moderately faithful plot and the great special effects were there, granted, and maybe even some of the acting too; but it all felt so clumsy and disjointed! And so many things were cut out. It was all so sad, the intention was clearly there, but the spirit was definitely not. Hardly a match to the book. Lerman and Daddario may have been ok, at best; but Brosnan as Chiron was so laughable. And the ending so insulting to the series progression! (view spoiler)[Fighting Kronos? Really??? Like they couldn‚Äôt wait to throw the biggest final antagonist of the series right at the beginning. And inexperienced newcomer Percy winning so easily, against the most dreadfully powerful god ever. Give me a break! (hide spoiler)] Sadly, Not Recommendable. Many points to Sean Bean for not dying though!

 Felicidad Mitol√≥gica.  

Percy Jackson es un aventurado jovenzuelo asistiendo a la Academia Yancy. Su vida dando un vuelco total cuando durante una visita escolar a un museo es atacado y casi asesinado por una harp√≠a. No todos los d√≠as te enter√°s que sos el hijo ileg√≠timo de un dios y que est√°s siendo cazado por monstruos mitol√≥gicos. Lo que sigue es un estrecho escape a Campo Mestizo, hogar y refugio para todos los no reconocidos descendientes de las muchas deidades del Olimpo. Las cosas no mejoras cuando comprende que su nacimiento significa la violaci√≥n de un milenario pacto, es acusado de robar el rayo de Zeus, y la posibilidad de una guerra celestial a gran escala se acerca a un punto de no retorno. 

2014 fue el mejor a√±o de mi joven vida lectora. Compr√© una tablet, descubr√≠ Goodreads, y con ello un oc√©ano infinito de libros y posibilidades que jam√°s sab√≠a que exist√≠a. Ese a√±o devor√© todos los libros de la saga Dador, Juegos del Hambre y Divergente uno tras de otro, pero Percy Jackson fue mi m√°s primero. 

Simplemente am√© a Percy, Annabeth, Grover y Sally. ¬°Odi√© tanto a Gabe! Y a Clarisse, al menos al principio. Completamente fascinado por la construcci√≥n del mundo y todos sus maravillosos personajes, las referencias a la mitolog√≠a griega, las continuas revelaciones, la cautivante progresi√≥n de la historia, y la acci√≥n sin final. Este libro fue tan completamente un cielo de lo Joven Adulto. C√≥mo podr√≠a olvidar el Campamento Mestizo, el Casino Loto, las peleas contra tantas figuras mitol√≥gicas como el Minotauro, las Furias, Medusa, Equidna, Quimera, Ares, Cerbero‚Ä¶ Tantas entra√±ables y terribles momentos para recordar (view spoiler)[¬°La escena del Minotauro y las Perlas! (hide spoiler)]. La gran revelaci√≥n final (view spoiler)[con Luke (hide spoiler)] fue un poco decepcionante, pero un decente final sin embargo. Y adem√°s, ¬øqu√© libro es perfecto? ¬°Aunque estuvo tan cerca! Un espectacular comienzo para una de mis m√°s queridas series de fantas√≠a jam√°s. Altamente Recomendable para los amantes de la Fantas√≠a Joven Adulto, y adultos con un ni√±o en el coraz√≥n.

*** La pel√≠cula (2010) fue una gansada y una de las m√°s decepcionantes adaptaciones que vi jam√°s. ¬°O sea fue todo tan raramente filmado! La trama moderadamente fiel y los geniales efectos especiales estuvieron ah√≠, concedido, y tal vez incluso algo de la actuaci√≥n tambi√©n; ¬°pero todo se sinti√≥ tan mal e inconexo! Y tantas cosas dejadas afuera. Fue todo tan triste, la intenci√≥n claramente estuvo ah√≠, pero el esp√≠ritu definitivamente no. Dif√≠cilmente comparable al libro. Lerman y Daddario tal vez estuvieron ok, cuando mucho; pero Brosnan como Quir√≥n fue lamentable. ¬°Y el final tan insultante a la progresi√≥n de la serie! (view spoiler)[¬øPelear contra Cronos? ¬ø¬ø¬øEn serio??? Como si no pudieran esperar para lanzar al mayor antagonista final de la serie directo al principio. Y el inexperto reci√©n llegado Percy gan√°ndole tan f√°cilmente, contra el m√°s terriblemente poderoso dios jam√°s. ¬°Por favor!

222,Sarah,The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure,"Feb 18, 2018",4,"Prince Humperdinck of Florin, an adept hunter but terrible human being, wants to start a war with the neighboring, equally tiny, kingdom of Guilder. To this end he schemes to marry a beautiful peasant lass named Buttercup, market her as Florin‚Äôs sweetheart, have her assassinated, and frame Guilder. In these machinations he is assisted by Count Rugen, a sadist obsessed with measuring pain.

A trio of mercenaries‚ÄîVizzini the delusional windbag ‚Äúdizzying intellect‚Äù from Sicily, I√±igo the master Spanish swordsman, and Fezzik the giant Turkish wrestler‚Äîare recruited to stage Buttercup‚Äôs abduction and dispose of her in the general neighborhood of Guilder. But as they traverse the Cliffs of Insanity, they are pursued by the Dread Pirate Roberts, a black-clad masked man whom no giant fist, well-wielded blade, or pompous brilliant mind can stop.

Why is Buttercup so important to Roberts? Is he connected to Westley, Buttercup‚Äôs farm-boy sweetheart who sailed away years ago to seek his fortune?



William Goldman‚Äôs novel, which satirizes old-fashioned swashbucklers and merrily bulldozes the fourth wall every other page, was published in 1975, but largely overshadowed by the 1987 film adaptation, wherein Goldman wrote the screenplay of his own novel. A central conceit of the story is that Goldman‚Äôs work is a mere abridged version of a longwinded epic by the fictitious S. Morgenstern. The layers of meta-commentary can feel a bit stifling; luckily the film dispenses with Goldman‚Äôs ‚Äúscholarly‚Äù digressions, using a grandpa reading to his grandson as a framing device instead.

The book is not quite as family-friendly as the movie. In one of the many forewords‚Äîthis book has as many forewords as The Return of the King had endings‚ÄîGoldman finds himself chatting up a bikini-clad woman one-third his age while he‚Äôs supposed to be buying his young son a birthday present (both the woman and the son are fictional).

Then in the epilogue, ‚ÄúButtercup‚Äôs Baby,‚Äù we see Buttercup teasing Westley into bed with her. It‚Äôs not graphic or salacious at all‚Äîquite tame by adult fiction standards, and substantially less horny than many a modern YA‚Äîbut stuff like this is intrusive and weird when you remember that people show the movie to six-year-olds.



Finally, while I thoroughly enjoyed Goldman‚Äôs asides at first, they can seriously disrupt the story‚Äôs flow at some points and become a chore to slog through. The multiple forwards are too long, especially combined. The Hollywood secrets and Morgenstern gags are hilarious in moderation, but I think he overused them.

The funniest material by far is in the story proper, almost all of which made it into the film:





""True love is the best thing in the world, except for cough drops. Everyone knows that"" ~Miracle Max (GIF unavailable)

Also, Buttercup‚Äôs horse is named Horse. Goldman tells us she wasn‚Äôt very creative.

The book I recommend for people who love the movie and are very patient.

The movie I recommend for everyone. The jokes work beautifully on screen, and every character is perfectly cast. Watch it today!"

1939, Nazi Germany. Liesel Meminger is an impoverished and fragile ten years old girl barely scrapping by with her foster parents, the Hubermanns; the ever loving Hans and the deathly strict Rosa. On her spare time Liesel plays with her neighbor Rudy, and secretly steals books, any book she can find. Dedicated studies, work commitment and fierce sacrifices the daily routine; until one day an injured agonizing Jewish man collapses at the doorstep of their home. His mere presence endangering all their lives, if someone ever finds out.

By far the best WWII Historical Fiction I‚Äôve ever read methinks, with an infinity of quotes and moments to remember by. Literary perfection as far as I‚Äôm concerned, especially for a lover of words, and a bookworm. A beautifully crafted unforgettable story, equally heartbreaking and heartwarming to no end; exquisitely weaved, with a flawless style of writing. So many terribly endearing characters; Liesel, Hans, Max, Rudy, and even Rosa, sometimes. (view spoiler)[ The hairbrush whisper!  (hide spoiler)] Amazing progression and character development. Consistently captivating storytelling, and even sporadically funny at times; with a completely unexpected and devastating ending that I‚Äôll never forget, or get over from. (view spoiler)[ Oh Rudy <\3  (hide spoiler)]

A book that for a long time was my very fav No. 1, until I read I Am the Messenger  that is, also by the same author. This book came just at the right time, more than a decade ago when I didn‚Äôt even know about GR, and picked it up at a local library almost on a whim. And even though I can‚Äôt stand WW literature nowadays, still remains solidly among my Top 10. 

A must read in life. EXTREMELY Recommendable!

*** The Book Thief (2013) is a lovely adaptation. Superbly capturing most of the essence and best highlights of the book. An outstanding performance by Geoffrey Rush, truly deserving of especial recognition; Sophie Nelisse and Emily Watson were awesome too. Very faithful to the book too, and with an alternative, yet still welcomed, ending. 8.5/10. Recommendable! The book won hands down though. (view spoiler)[ The Apple logo at the end... really?

224,Rachel,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Jun 15, 2007",5,"As much as people say it, this really is one of my favorite books of all time. MTV promoted it, it got a lot of press, so many people shun it and say it is overrated. I disagree.

I didn't read this book until last year, when I turned 21. My boyfriend owned it, it seemed like a quick read, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

Main character Charlie is loveable from the first sentence out of his mouth. There are endless quoteable quotes in this book that had me folding the page over so I could write them down later. Charlie has an honest innocence to him yet such an intense depth and intelligent mind that he is quite the multifaceted character.

While the story has its ups and downs, and really, there isn't a very intense plot, the reader is somehow sucked into Charlies head sharing his first kiss, his feelings toward his new friends, his feelings towards literature and music. He is naiive about so many things, and his bluntness made me laugh out loud on numerous occasions. He not only deals with issues like love, but also having a gay friend, dealing with death, and sexual assault, but also sharing his love of music and literature, which I think are two things that are being lost on youth today.

I would give this book to every teenage boy and girl I knew. While Charlie isn't exactly a excellent role model, he does show that being different is O.K. and that friends come in all kinds of packages...to stay true to yourself. These things matter."

Friendship, dream, agony.This book is not an easy read by any means. But while the book graced with beautiful friendships and human kindness, it also explores the darkest aspects of humanity and ugly racism. That's a story of the love of one man for his friend, he is willing to give up so much to help his friend because he loves him like a brother. That's a masterfully written book with a very tragic ending and I couldn't stop my tears.

I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and that's why.

Classic."
227,Stephen,The Princess Bride,"Nov 15, 2008",5,"5.0 stars. HOW AMAZINGLY GOOD IS THIS BOOK YOU ASK?....so good it is almost




This is a literary treasure and one that I can not recommend more highly. Let me start by saying that prior to reading this book I had probably seen the movie version a dozen times or so and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! I only mention this so that you know where I'm coming from in case you are not a fan of the movie as I think if you like one you will like the other and, conversely, if you didn‚Äôt like the movie, the book may not appeal to you as much. 

As for the book, I was AMAZED at what a superb adaptation of the novel the movie was. Along with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and No Country for Old Men, this may be the best adaptation of a classic novel that I have ever come across. This may lead you to ask whether it is even worth it to read the book given that much of what is in the book is on the screen. My answer to that would be a resounding YES!! 



First of all, the book is as much fun as the movie and the tone of the writing is unique, playful and very funny. Despite knowing the plot of the book intimately, I found the reading experience to be fresh and new. 

I am going to assume that people reading this have seen the movie, read the book or at least have an understanding of the basic plot. If not, the book description and other reviews do a very good job of explaining it. Instead, I thought it might be helpful to mention those parts of the book that were not included in the movie or that I thought the book‚Äôs treatment was superior (i.e. Book is Better) and those aspects of the movie that I thought were superior to the source material (i.e. Movie is Better). 

BOOK IS BETTER:

1.	Prince Humperdinck‚Äôs Zoo of Death (not mentioned in the movie and I thought it was interesting and gave great insight into the character).

2.	The Book does a much better job than the movie in describing Prince Humperdinck as a truly evil person and thus a top notch villain. 

3.	The book contains a whole Chapter on Inigo Montoya that provides details of his childhood and his Father‚Äôs original encounter with the Six Fingered Man (this is dealt with in a very brief conversation in the movie). I really enjoyed the expanded version.

4.	The book also contains a whole chapter on Fezzik and shows his childhood and early years. This was excellent and I really liked learning about his trouble in adapting to deal with his enormous size. 

5.	The beginning of the book describes how Buttercup becomes the ‚Äúmost beautiful woman in the world‚Äù and the fate of the women in front of her. This is absolutely HYSTERICAL. I wish they would have found a way to incorporate this into the movie because it was very enjoyable. 

6.	All of the interruptions in the Narrative where the author is explaining why he cut out whole sections of the original Morgenstern novel (the fictional novel of which this novel was supposedly the abridged ‚Äúgood parts‚Äù) were very funny and made the book a unique experience. 

MOVIE IS BETTER:

1.	I must begin with Miracle Max. The book is really good, but Billy Crystal was absolutely AMAZING (as was Carol Kane who played Miracle Max's wife). Crystal‚Äôs dialogue in the movie was better than the book and is a great example of making the original even better without messing with the feel of the story. 

2.	Wallace Shawn as Vizzini (pictured above) gives a truly great comic performance and made the Movie version of the character even more fun then the book version. All I kept hearing in my head whenever he was on stage in the book was him shouting INCONCEIVABLE!!

3.	Similarly, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya is another example of amazing casting that made the on screen version of the character even more fun than the book version. 

4.	The final scene between Westley and Prince Humperdinck was more fun in the movie than in the book. 

Bottom-line, if you have enjoyed the movie but have not read the book, I strongly recommend it. Similarly, if you have read the book and have not seen the movie, I strongly recommend that as well. Both are terrific."
228,Federico DN,The Alchemist,"Feb 24, 2014",4,"Coelho‚Äôs finest?  

Andalusia, Spain. Young poor shepherd Santiago has a very vivid dream in which he finds some lost treasure in a remote unknown location. After consulting a fortune teller, he learns that in order to find it he may need to travel as far as the Egyptian pyramids. A practically impossible task, since he doesn‚Äôt have a map, any rational reason, or even the means to fulfil it. This is the story of his fantastic journey, and how he attempts to fulfill a wild quest, that could potentially change his life.

Coelho‚Äôs most acclaimed masterpiece and famed work hands down; a very short allegorical tale about listening to your heart, and following your dreams, no matter what. I particularly enjoyed the exchanges with the mysterious old king, the time spent with the crystal merchant, and meeting Fatima, the desert girl. The oasis and the encounter with the Alchemist was good, but felt a bit farfetched, and his teachings somewhat repetitive. Still, a considerable amount of quotes and moments to remember by; with some very nice plot twists, a sublimely satisfying ending, and a spiritually uplifting message. I remember enormously enjoying this novella back in the day, the wowing feeling sadly gradually diminishing over the years. Still, I don‚Äôt regret reading it; this was overall a worthy read, and memorable, despite de glaring self-help vibes. I liked learning about the ‚ÄúPersonal Legend‚Äù, among other curious esoteric concepts. Recommendable, for the right audience.

Personally I must admit I enjoyed  Veronika Decides to Die a lot more; but if you ever had in mind picking up Coelho someday, this is a good choice too. A highly uplifting story with a very memorable message, for those willing to listen to it.

PERSONAL NOTE

 ¬øLo mejor de Coelho?  

Andaluc√≠a, Espa√±a. El joven y pobre pastor Santiago tiene un sue√±o muy v√≠vido en el que encuentra un tesoro perdido en un remoto y desconocido lugar. Despu√©s de consultar una adivinadora, descubre que para hallarlo necesitar√≠a viajar tan lejos como hasta las pir√°mides egipcias. Una tarea pr√°cticamente imposible, ya que no posee un mapa, ni una raz√≥n racional, o los medio para completarla. Esta es la historia de su fant√°stico viaje, y c√≥mo intenta lograr una alocada misi√≥n, que potencialmente podr√≠a cambiar su vida.

La obra maestra m√°s aclamada y famosa de Coelho por lejos; un muy corto relato aleg√≥rico sobre escuchar tu coraz√≥n, y seguir tus sue√±os, sin importar qu√©. Particularmente disfrut√© los intercambios con el misterioso viejo rey, el tiempo que transcurri√≥ con el mercader de cristales, y el encuentro con F√°tima, la chica del desierto. El oasis y el encuentro con el Alquimista fue bueno, pero se sinti√≥ un poco demasiado incre√≠ble, y sus ense√±anzas un tanto repetitivas. Aun as√≠, una considerable cantidad de citas y momentos para el recuerdo; con unas muy interesantes vueltas de trama, un sublimemente satisfactorio final, y un mensaje espiritualmente elevador. Recuerdo disfrutar esta novela corta enormemente en su d√≠a, la maravillosa sensaci√≥n de asombro lamentablemente gradualmente disminuyendo con el correr de los a√±os. Sin embargo, no me arrepiento de haberla le√≠do; esta fue por sobre todo una valiosa lectura, y memorable, a pesar del llamativo tinte de autoayuda. Me gust√≥ conocer la ‚ÄúLeyenda Personal‚Äù, entre otros curiosos conceptos esot√©ricos. Recomendable, para la audiencia correcta.

Personalmente debo admitir que disfrut√©  ‚ÄúVeronika Decide Morir‚Äù  mucho m√°s; pero si alguna vez tuviste en mente leer Coelho alg√∫n d√≠a, ‚ÄúEl Alquimista‚Äù es tambi√©n una buena elecci√≥n. Una historia altamente elevadora con un mensaje muy memorable, para aquellos dispuestos a escucharla.

‚ÄúNonsense. You‚Äôre only saying that because no one ever has.‚Äù
 Buttercup spent her entire life on a farm with her mom, dad and the farm boy who lived outside in the hovel.

But then, one day, all that changed.

She became beautiful. 
Life isn't fair, it's just fairer than death, that's all.
And soon she learns that with great beauty comes great tragedy. 

For soon after she learns that the Farm By (now known as Westley) loves her, he sails off to make a fortune and is seemingly lost forever. 

Meanwhile Prince Humperdinck learns that the most beautiful woman in all the land is of marrying age and demands her to become his wife and she agrees, deciding early that she will kill herself when the time comes (which is actually quite convenient, considering Humperdinck was planning on killing her too)

But then, Buttercup is kidnapped by a quirky trio of characters (A Sicilian, a giant and a master swordsman), is then pursued by a mysterious masked man, must fight her way through man-eating eels, giant swamp rats and so much more.

The rest, as they say, is history. 
‚ÄúAs you wish...‚Äù
 As always, I am ABSOLUTELY in love with this book.

This time I read the 30th edition - where I learned of the (view spoiler)[ not-so-true (hide spoiler)] story of the author's first encounter with S. Morgenstern's classic tale.

Just a quick note - skip the introduction. It goes on and on and on and honestly really put a damper on my enjoyment of this book. Very frustrating that it ended up being (view spoiler)[ completely false to boot (hide spoiler)].
‚ÄúInconceivable!""
""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.‚Äù
Essentially, it's suffice to know that the Princess Bride is based on a longer story that Goldman edited down into a more manageable book.

I do absolutely LOVE the satire and the characters in this book. The plot is ever the exciting whirlwind and every time I finish reading it, I just want to go back in again.

The 30th edition is beautifully illustrated and really gives the book that extra lift. 

Highly, highly recommended!

230,jessica,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Mar 13, 2019",4,"in true hosseini fashion, this book does not shy away from heavy, and sometimes uncomfortable, topics. but i realised that this book should make the reader feel uncomfortable. the tragedies that women face, even today, are crimes against humanity. but the strength of the two women this story follows is deeply moving and incredibly inspiring. 

to save my heart from emotional devastation, i tried to focus on the positives of this story, which can be summed up in this quote:


‚Äòthey would make new lives for themselves - peaceful, solitary lives - and there the weight of all that they had endured would lift from them, and they would be deserving of all the happiness and simple prosperity they would find.‚Äô

what a beautiful sentiment, that trials and suffering can help lead up to something more - more hope, more happiness. this story is a testament to the will-power and resilience of women, as well as a wonderful portrayal of friendship, family, and love. such a powerful book and a must-read for everyone.

231,Maxwell,Anne of Green Gables ,"Nov 28, 2016",4,"I never read Anne's story when I was younger, so when I heard that Rachel McAdams was narrating the first in the series I knew I had to give it a go. I'm a sucker for a celebrity-narrated audiobook (if you haven't checked out Maggie Gyllenhaal's reading of  The Bell Jar, do that now!).

It's wonderful to read a story that, for the most part, is extremely uplifting. There's hardly anything truly terrible that happens in this story, and that's quite refreshing. Granted, it is a children's novel and from the early 1900's‚Äîso it has that moralistic quality to it wherein each incident Anne undergoes resolves itself with a lesson learned. But it was delightful, and Anne's optimism is contagious. Rachel McAdams also does a great job at encapsulating that attitude; I felt like I could hear her smile.

If, like me, you've never given Anne's story a chance, I can highly recommend the audiobook route. And I'm definitely going to continue listening to this series, especially when I'm in need of a pick-me-up."
232,Cecily,The Alchemist,"May 30, 2008",1,"Superficially deep (ie deep on the surface and shallow underneath), but actually rather pretentious new age waffle - yet somehow manages to be beautiful despite that. I would have enjoyed it in my late teens/early 20s (when I enjoyed Jonathan Livingston Seagull), but reading this as an adult, I found it annoyingly unsubtle.

Reading, and disliking this, was something of a watershed: a few years earlier and I'd probably have loved it, but as it was, I realised I'd turned into a cynical adult (and I know where I get that from!)."
233,Destinee,The Lightning Thief ,"Jul 30, 2008",4,"** spoiler alert **
           When I was about halfway through this book, I started making a list of its similarities to Harry Potter. Here is a sampling from that list:

1. There are three young heroes: a brainy girl (Annabeth/Hermione), a funny screw-up type (Grover/Ron), and a somewhat troubled but very brave lead (Harry/Percy).

2. People freak when the Harry/Percy character says the name of a powerful character. 

3. The main bad guy (Kronos/Voldemort) is seeking to return to his former power, but most people are totally in denial of that happening.

4. The heroes train at a school that divides its students according to their character. (Chiron, the head trainer of the camp, equals Dumbledore.)

5. Chiron/Dumbledore knows a prophecy about Percy/Harry but won't tell Percy/Harry what it is exactly.

6. Percy/Harry has a gross stepfather named Smelly Gabe who protects him during his childhood, so Smelly Gabe obviously equals the Dursleys. 

7. Harry/Percy can talk to a certain animal because of his special gifts (Harry could talk to snakes, Percy can talk to horses). 

8. Riordan's three young heroes face down a three-headed dog at the end of their big quest, which if I'm not mistaken is exactly what happens in HP1 (granted, the three-headed dog is straight out of Greek mythology, so I should cut Riordan some slack on this one).

I could go on (and on and on) which would be fun for me, but I won't. Instead, I'll shock you by saying that I totally loved this completely derivative book. It's super fun and fast-moving and the fact that it's kind of a HP rip-off actually makes me like it more. God, I loved Harry Potter. The Lighting Thief is like methadone. That might be what I said about the The Amulet of Samarkand but it's more true here. I can't wait to read the second one!"
234,Nilesh Kashyap,The Giving Tree,"Mar 11, 2012",1,"I try to steal books written for children, since I am no giving tree and I am not paying for what my child reads. But this book, each time I read this (at the bookshop itself), I thrust it back to the place from where I took it, angrily, if I may add. This book does not deserve to be stolen. 

What makes me angry:
Each time I read this story, all I want to do is to insert my hand in bookcover, catch that falling fruit and saw the tree and take it home and make bat for my child a foot that my bed is missing (currently balanced on bricks) and add an extra plank to my bed so that I can lay with my legs spread a little more. After being fully relaxed, then, yes then, I would eat that tasty fruit and thus making sure that miniature, cute-looking, never-happy piece-of-shit gets nothing.
But seriously speaking (this does not mean, I was not serious before), the tree which reduced itself to a stump, repeatedly asked the boy to sit under her shade and play with her. But all that mattered to that boy were his needs, indeed the tree fulfilled all his needs by giving all she had and not once that boy was thankful to her.

I don‚Äôt think this story signifies parent and child relationship. This boy, all he shared was his problems but what about those moments when he enjoyed his life. In reality, obviously we tell our problems to our parents, and they do eventually help us get rid of it. But it is also those moments of happiness that we share with them.
Happiness gets double when shared (with the right person). 
Parents do grow along with the child unlike the tree which diminished itself to make child happy, but never ever saw him happy and smiling.
This story is often read by parents to their child but what if it makes them feel miserable and guilty, thinking that their parents are like the ‚Äògiving tree‚Äô and they don‚Äôt give anything in return. How can anyone read this book to a child?

I told the story to my mother and asked about her thoughts - First of all she recites a verse in Sanskrit and translates to me as:
A tree never eats its own fruit and a river never drinks its own water. 
Further she explains it that they (tree, river and in general nature) exist not for themselves but for others.
I think to myself that it is also we people (certainly not everyone), who are there to protect and conserve them as our token of mutual love. 
As I am writing this review a song plays faintly in my mind:
 Sweet dreams are made of these
 Who am I to disagree?
 Travel the world and the seven seas
 Everybody's looking for something
 Some of them want to use you
 Some of them want to get used by you
 Some of them want to abuse you
 Some of them want to be abused
 Sweet dreams are made of these
 Who am I to disagree? I am utterly confused what this story is about and what message Mr. Silverstein was trying to convey....but what i know for sure is that Marilyn Manson Rocks!"
235,Nancy,Lord of the Flies,"Jan 14, 2008",5,"Lord of the Flies is one of the most disturbing books I've ever read. It was required high school reading and since then, I've read it four more times. It is as disturbing now as it was then. Using a group of innocent schoolboys stranded on an island, the author very realistically portrays human behavior in an environment where civilization no longer has meaning."
236,Alexander,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Jan 11, 2008",2,"** spoiler alert **
           I read this novel because it was often the favorite novel of students of mine, and I wanted to understand why. I should mention that I love science fiction, and have read it avidly since I was barely more than a child. I'm not by any means some kind of anti-sci-fi snob.

The first thing that bothered me is that the novel sets adults against gifted children in a way that strikes me as bizarre. Adults are essentially evil but teachers especially. The children are inherently excellent, capable of helping each other in trying to figure out just what the adults are hiding, which is, in this case, a vast and secret war they are tricking the children into fighting for them. This was perhaps the hardest to believe of all the things thrown at the reader, and interestingly, it is hidden from you until the very end, though you can guess at it before then.

What disturbed me the most is that the writing is terrible---far too much happens internally, inside the character's head--it's an emo space opera, basically--and one of the most interesting events of the book is nearly buried and the presentation of it is rushed, because it is near the end. There are many points in the battle scenes where it is impossible to understand what's happening. And the penultimate plot event, where it's revealed all of the games were not..games...could have been handled more interestingly. But the novel was overdetermined, things happening only because the writer wants them too and not because they feel inevitable, and so too many of the arrows point in the same direction. By the time Ender meets Mazer, his final teacher, my eyes rolled back into my head at the implausibility of it all. 

And it's worth mentioning the thing no one prepared me for was the bizarre homoerotic subtext built into the book as well, a subtext that is sometimes just a plain old supertext, on display, right beside how women in this novel are to be loved distantly and kept from real knowledge, and turned against themselves, so they can then be used to compel others.

It creeped me out and I'm gay.

I'm also a former 'gifted child', and was tested and poked and pushed, all of these things, made to study computer programming when I didn't want to, and I made myself fail out of their program to get away from them. But I found no commonality with the gifted children here, not as I have in other stories about gifted children, say, like Salinger's Glass family. Also, these kids are all jerks. 

I do hand it to Card for the ideas in the novel: blogging? Yes. It's in here, well before anyone was doing it, and it ...matters a lot, and in the ways blogging matters. Also the idea of an institution that runs on the manipulation of its populace into a distant war with an implacable foe, as a way of controlling people. And a society that has no privacy at all, not even in dreams. This novel does offer a dark picture of what life is like under these terms. Also, the idea of how a hive-mind would think differently, without language, and the complications of communicating with someone like that, that's brilliant also.

I wish it had been revised--that the battle scenes were clearer, that the movement of the novel's action, the way the 'buggers' are in a race to try and communicate with Ender before he kills them, that this were more obvious to the reader, and not a surprise whipped out at the end, so that it could have lent tension to the scenes of the games and manipulation, which were only boring. And Ender's decision, to be the Speaker for the Dead, that struck me cold, because in the end, the buggers were only trying to do what everyone else in his life were doing to him: poring over what makes him tick and trying to get him to do their bidding. 

The novel contains a rant against style at the beginning, added by Card, called 'literary tricks' by him. I think the most interesting thing about it is that given the millions sold, it is proof that story matters more than style, even as convoluted and badly formed as this one is. In the end what matters is the questions the novel raises and the implications of the questions, and that the novel really is about something at its core, behind all of the badly rendered fight scenes. I admire style, don't get me wrong. I love it. But it would appear you can get by without it."
237,Lisa of Troy,Of Mice and Men,"Apr 30, 2022",5,"John Steinbeck‚Äôs Of Mice and Men is a novella (around 72 pages) that focuses on two men in The Great Depression Era. George is a small man while Lennie is the bigger man. They are two farmhands who have a big dream to one day own their own small place. However, George and Lennie have just been run out of town. Is this ranch their second chance? Will George and Lennie realize their dream?

Of Mice and Men is a very dark novella. I mean dark. Steinbeck is a master at setting the scene. He begins each chapter with a few paragraphs about the landscape. This sets an eerie tone, almost like sitting on top of a powder keg. 

The character development in this book is really second to none. Many authors will write characters as all good or all bad. However, Steinbeck‚Äôs characters are well developed. They are not perfect, and they don‚Äôt fit nicely into one mold. That leaves the reader wondering what the character will do because they haven‚Äôt been type cast. 

Of Mice and Men is chock full of symbolism. George and Lennie are obsessed with The American Dream. However, is it ever attainable? Does society treat people as interchangeable? Are our social safety nets strong and working appropriately? 

Do our social safety nets work? Please allow me to answer that question from the US perspective. It is a resounding NO. Here in the United States, we have something called Social Security Disability. If you can‚Äôt work because of a disability, you can apply for this program. It takes 3 months just to get someone assigned to your case. That is 3 months without being paid. Only 22% of claims are initially approved. The average process takes 27 months (2-3 years). This is someone who cannot go out and get another job. They are disabled! Who can go 2-3 years without getting paid? Who can not pay their mortgage, their car payment, their medical bills for 2-3 years?

This is a really fun book to talk about in a book club. It was part of the April Readalong. If you want to take a look at our discussion, take a look here.

Overall, I am happy that I read this book. I really enjoyed how Steinbeck set the scene and admire how he was able to set a super creepy tone. This book has some major depth with his use of symbolism. Of Mice and Men is not long-winded. However, this book was a bit too dark for me. Thanks for everyone who participated in the Readalong!

Believe it or not, I am still unable to review this, one of my very favorite novels of all time. 



I annotated my most recent time reading it, in the hopes that it would help when it came to composing my final thoughts.



Alas, what I am really struggling with is the idea of little ole' me 'reviewing' a masterpiece. 

I guess my goal is more to compel people to pick up this amazing piece of world literature and give it a shot, as opposed to providing an analysis of Stoker's work. 



We all know in reality a full review will never come.

Regardless, have a gander at this The Lost Boys gif, a movie greatly inspired by Dracula:



Full review or not, I am so happy to have reread this for the 3rd time. Dracula is a book I will continue to reread periodically for the rest of my life.

It‚Äôs Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland, plus Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, plus a ton of critical analysis and fun facts and biographical info and poetry and background and cultural and period information and bonus illustrations and basically all you need or could ever want to know, except if you‚Äôre me and your love for and curiosity about Alice and Lewis Carroll and Wonderland will never be satiated.

And also it‚Äôs about a square yard and the font is tiny and it weighs about 30 pounds and takes an eternity to read.

I loved this so much that it made my heart hurt to finish it. My version of paradise is probably something like this, where I‚Äôm alternating between reading the original text I love more than anything and eloquent, wise, humorous elaboration on things I had never known. The more I learned, the more I wanted to know.

I guess you could say I grew‚Ä¶curiouser and curiouser.

I love myself.

Anyway, my bookmark for this book was a folded-up sheet of lined paper on which I wrote down the titles and works of art and research queries I wanted to know more about as I read. I filled up both sides of that sheet.

Absolutely every aspect of this book is gorgeous and curated and fascinating. I don‚Äôt really know how to review this because it basically transcended reading for me. 

It was just a perfect experience.

Bottom line: If you love Alice like I do, or really really like it, you need to read this book. It‚Äôs a gift. That‚Äôs all I can say.

240,Will Byrnes,The Hunger Games ,"Jul 15, 2010",4,"** spoiler alert **
           What was once North America has been reduced, by what we are not told. The new country, Panem (as in the ‚Äúbread‚Äù part of Rome‚Äôs Bread and Circuses, or supposedly, Pan-America) is not exactly a fun place to live. A decadent Capitol rules over 12 subservient, worker districts. Katliss is a 16-year-old who lives with her depression-incapacitated mother and her 12-year-old sister, Prim, whom she loves more than anything. She lives in the coal-producing District 12, a sooty place in the former Appalachia where life expectancy is as bleak as the food ration is small. She learned hunting skills from her late father and supplements her family‚Äôs meager ration with game, hunting frequently with her 18-yr-old friend Gale. 


Suzanne Collins - from fictiondb.com 

Hearkening back to ancient Greece, as a way of demonstrating its dominance over the twelve districts, every year each district must send one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 18 the Hunger Games. Contestants, or tributes, in the very Rome-centric nomenclature of the book, are selected by lottery, but one can get food for increasing the number of entries one is willing to submit. This is not necessarily a lottery you would want to win, as the Hunger Games contest is a gladiatorial battle to the death. Joining an ancient form of barbarity with a more modern version, the contest is seen by the nation on television, gussied up with all the pomp and circumstance of the World Cup, Superbowl and World Series combined, with the degrading intrusiveness of reality television.


Primrose Everdeen gets the bad news - from Jabberjays.net

When the unlucky Prim is selected, Katliss offers to take her place, joining the muscular baker‚Äôs son, Peeta. They are transported to the Capitol, dressed up, interviewed on TV, offered training in several forms of combat and sent out there to do or die. The rest is their ordeal, which includes having to succeed not only with physical skills such as strength and agility. In addition to the need for cunning in figuring out how to best their competitors, they have to figure out how to please the television audience, among which are sponsors who might send them much needed goods during the game. 

Katliss is caught not only in a brutal contest with the other tributes, but in a confusing battle with her own adolescent emotions. What are her feelings, really, for her male counterpart from District 12, Peeta, and for her hunky bff Gale back home (team Gale vs team Peeta anyone)? How can she express her rage at the operators of this horror for their inhumanity? 


Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta - from ABC News

This is a fast-paced and engaging read, even for one who is waaaay past the target YA demographic. I quite enjoyed reading the book, hated putting it down. Collins offers characters one can root for, with enough inner conflict and complexity to matter, well some of them, without it being overbearing, or slowing down the story.

Ok, I liked the book. But I had a niggling concern early on. When I began reading, I wondered if there might be a political agenda at play. The ‚ÄúCapitol‚Äù is clearly the evil tyrant here, with the oppressed working people living in dread of their overlords. Had this story been published in the early-to-mid 20th century, one might presume that the ‚ÄúCapitol‚Äù stood in for the fascism of Germany, Italy or Spain, or the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union/Russia or China. However, given the political climate of the twenty-teens, in which cynical forces of the right seek at every opportunity to portray government of any sort as the personification of evil, one must wonder if the author subscribed to the notion. I confess to not having read her prior work, so lack a basis there, and the interviews with Collins I read offer no insight. So, I am not saying that this is so, just that the portrayal made me wonder. I will read more of Collins‚Äô work and look into the subject some more outside pages she wrote, and if I find anything definitive I will update this entry.

PS - Subsequent to writing the above, I read the following two Hunger Games books. I posted a review of Catching Fire in 2013, and while I did read Mockingjay I never got around to reviewing it. While I no longer feel a concern that Collins was consciously attempting to impart a stealth right-wing perspective, I still had a feeling that there was something else going on here. Thankfully, GR friend Kyra offered a link to an article in The Guardian that articulated very clearly what my innards were only able to communicate with vague visceral discomfort. Here is the link. I suggest you check it out for yourselves. Here is  another perspective  if the subject is of interest

241,Henry Avila,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"May 12, 2013",4,"""A face without a heart"", so said Shakespeare in Hamlet, but it applies to the portrait of Dorian Gray even better.... When the young gentleman Dorian Gray from a wealthy aristocratic family in Victorian England, has his picture completed something is missing, Basil Hallward, the painter senses it and insists that no one sees his greatest work, except a few people ... The witty Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian's soon to be best friend seems amused, a shy artist! All three are fascinated by the painting, discussing it at length in Mr.Hallward's house. The lord is a notorious man, with a well- deserved evil reputation, warned by many to stay away from him. Nevertheless Gray's a lonely orphan, needs excitement in his dreary life, Wotton tells Dorian to have fun while he is still young, it will not last long. Mr.Gray has good looks, and like a moth to a flame the boy can't resist. Dorian wishes that the portrait ages while he remains young, as time goes by, Dorian would give his soul for this, Lord Henry laughs at the oath, strangely his request is fulfilled shortly afterwards. Dorian meets a beautiful seventeen- year- old actress, both fall madly in love, later the nervous Sibyl Vane, gives a really bad performance in front of Gray , and his two friends, Wotton, Hallward, the young gentleman is crushed , and so disappointed he leaves her. Sibyl then kills herself, James her brother had pledged to destroy anyone who harms his sister, he will cause Mr.Gray much concern subsequently. The wicked lord tells the distraught youth to forget about it, ""Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secrets, wild joy and wilder sins"". All this and only the picture to show its evil, a great bargain Dorian feels. Rumors abound about Dorian, they the people look at his face and see only purity, Gray continues his hedonistic life, murder , another suicide and a killing results ... In a locked, quiet, dark room upstairs at his home, where the curious Mr.Gray keeps the painting, it Grotesquely Changes, whenever more wickedness is committed by the owner. The ugly side of Dorian, only he sees... Later into the shadows , Dorian goes to get opium, he wants salvation through drugs, blackout his memories but gloom is everywhere, a thick atmosphere of foreboding, intense desperation and immense helplessness, prevails. Reaching for something, that will save his poor soul, make him feel worthwhile that life has some meaning, is all lost? A mournful torrent rushes Dorian forward always forward, into the abyss, the darkness, the endless unknown regions, next oblivion? The light is going out, Dorian must face his destiny, he couldn't escape himself ..."
242,Icarus,The Princess Bride,"Jul 24, 2007",3,"I am one of the few people in the world who does not think the book is better than the movie here. There is an undercurrent of bitterness in this book that I find off-putting. I am given to understand by a friend that those elements--i.e., the autobiographical stuff in Goldman's own persona--are actually fictional. But I found that they soured my enjoyment of the story they framed. I couldn't enjoy the writing of a writer who seemed as misanthropic and hateful as Goldman came off to me. TPB is still a great book--better than three stars, but I couldn't quite bring myself to give it four.

Stick to the movie. It has the opposite problem, but you can always fast forward through the saccharine Fred Savage bits."
243,Annemarie,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Sep 17, 2018",5,"This was one of the best-written books I have ever read. There was something so special about the writing style, I can't really put it into words. It was just so ""fitting"" and transported me right into this fascinating world. I knew absolutely nothing about the Geisha tradition going into this book, and I feel like I've learnt so much! It is extremely evident that the author did a lot of extensive research and clearly appreciates the Japanese culture. I never would have guessed that I could become so invested in the life of a single girl, who is growing up in a country I don't have any connection to, and who is living a lifestyle I've never thought all too much about before.

I thing the exquisite writing style is what truly makes this book. Of course the plot is interesting as well (especially if, like me, you don't know anything about all the work that goes into becoming a Geisha), but without  Arthur Golden's wonderful storytelling it would have been only half as good. He made me feel things I wouldn't have felt otherwise. He managed to make even the most mundane things sound exciting and interesting. I especially need to mention the fact that there were many things happening I would have found disgusting and appalling under different circumstances (this is not a critique on the book itself; these situations are realistic and an attribute to the time period the book takes place in). However, the author pulled me so far into the story and had such a beautiful way of describing things, that I just couldn't bring myself to be angry at anything.

All in all, this was an absolute perfect book to me. If I were to teach a writing class, I would definitely choose this novel as an example on great storytelling. It deserves all the hype and acclaim it gets."
244,Amit,The Alchemist,"Jun 07, 2008",5,"There are too many things one can learn from ‚ÄúThe Alchemist‚Äù. Its all about following your dream and about taking the risk of following your dreams, which is actually so difficult to do and there are very few people in this world who actually do, I mean risk it all, just to follow your heart and your dream. Beauty is, the author is so right in saying that when u decide to follow your dreams the entire universe conspires in your favour which he called as the ‚Äúbeginners luck‚Äù and we all have been witness to this beginners luck at one or other point in our lives. Also, he talks about a stage in our journey towards realizing our dreams, where everything just goes haywire and there is everything working against us and it almost takes us to the brink of abandoning everything and just getting back to what was so familiar and comfortable (i.e. our usual daily life which we get used to) this is actually the time when we are being tested for one last time and it means also that we are really close to our objective. The example given was really great and yes nothing new but we forget simple things in our life like ""the darkest hour of the night is just before the dawn"". It is actually true that so many of us just leave the struggle when it gets really tough and the chips are really low, whereas actually we were so close to the objective, if only we would have had a little more patience we would have been there. In one of the episodes he talks about death, yes the fact we always forget, the only reality about our life, it is a constant which is not going to change rest everything is uncertain. There are a lot of us who either think that it happens to others and then there are others, who are so busy running after the materials that they don‚Äôt have time to think about anything, leave alone death. Yes, and those who do think about death, mostly fear it, some fear death because of the physical pain attached to it (such people actually fear the pain rather than the death, I am one of them) and there are some who think they do not want to die because its not time yet for them to go. Ironically but true, this decision about timings has thankfully not been left to us. So, how do we get over the fear of death or make it our friend, a companion? And not waste our beautiful life worrying about dying all the time. One of the possible solutions lies in this book, it reads ""if i have to fight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other"". Yes very much right, one would never know when he or she wakes up in the morning that if it was the last day of his or her life and in fact, that day would not be any different from all the other days already spent. So, why not take everyday as the last day of our lives and live it up. Frankly speaking i really know what i am talking about, because I am in a profession which involves a lot of risk and death doesn‚Äôt have to look for reasons, it can just spring up from any bush in form of a small little piece of metal called a bullet coming out of the darkness of the night or just a deafening sound from under a culvert that I cross everyday. Here, everyday can be the last day of my life, every meal can be my last, every call to my wife can be the last time I would hear her sweet and loving voice and the kids‚Ä¶ Anyways, so what I personally follow is, everyday when I wake up or every time when I move out on an operation, I say to myself ""what a beautiful day to die"" and there on, I just do what I have to and what I have been taught in all these years in the army and go through all the motions and concentrate on the job at hand rather than worrying about my death and I am really at peace with the fear of death. Another beautiful thought which I came across about death was in the novel by the author called ""Confessions of a pilgrim"". I derived from it that death can be visualized as a beautiful person who is always sitting besides us, so close to us that it travels with us wherever we go and it also accompanies us to our bed. Its a beautiful companion, a faithful companion, the only one who will never be unfaithful to us, rest all the companions are just lesser mortals and have been unfaithful at one point or other. Death always stays with us and actually speaking that‚Äôs the only companion who would accompany us all through our lives right from the moment we acquired some shape in our mother‚Äôs womb to the moment when we would get the vision of that white light and that feeling of lightness when we would finally leave this body also sometimes expressed as ""VASTRA"" (clothes) in the Indian mythology. As per the Indian mythology, the soul never dies, it is indestructible, it only changes a body just like we change clothes. Our soul is a part of God and it goes back to him. We can find the mention of the mighty soul of ours around the last portion of 'The Alchemist' where the shepherd realizes that ultimately it his own soul which is the ‚Äúhand that wrote all‚Äù and his own soul was the part of soul of God. I firmly believe that there is no fiction involved in this story of the shepherd, but this is a true expression of mysteries and realities of our life, which we never pause to discover. There is message that this book wants to convey to us!!! I have never been into writing anything ever in my life, yes not even a personal dairy, but since the time I actually started writing which was just a month back, I realized that if we just write our thoughts as they occur, the resultant has a touch of mystery, because what we wrote with all our heart and soul, sometimes tends to surprise us. We tend to learn from what we ourselves wrote. We never realized that we had so much inside us and we don‚Äôt know from where, it all came. ‚ÄúThe hand that wrote all‚Äù, yes I think its our soul that speaks out, the soul we never recognized, the one we never knew, the one which is part of soul of God‚Ä¶. ‚Ä¶All religions have over all the years have preached a man ‚ÄúKnow thyself, you will find God‚Äù, ‚Äúlook within yourself u will find all the answers‚Äù, these words are so common but how many of us actually are ready to pause and give it a try. It may sound crazy, may be the book has a effect that may appear really crazy but I am sure there are some people who would identify with me. May be when Paulo Coelho wrote this book his soul was revealing itself and that‚Äôs why some of us can identify with it because our souls are the part of same soul of God, just like his is. May be these lines of his novel were written by the ‚ÄúHand that wrote all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"
245,Justin Tate,Little Women,"Dec 24, 2015",5,"Relentlessly captivating story of sisters doing it for themselves. Alcott is a master of character, pacing, and creating page-turning suspense within a context of moderately low stakes. I admire everything about her, from her writing talent to her personal life as an abolitionist and feminist. Much of her personal advocacy makes it into the pages of Little Women. Sometimes in subtle ways, and sometimes not. I'm glad to see that the new movie appears to spotlight the feminist undertones because its groundbreaking depth is easily hidden behind a wall of nonstop entertainment.

A true landmark of American literature, everyone should have this on their list of must-read classics. And for audiobook fans, Barbara Caruso's unabridged performance is one of the best of all time. 

PS: Don't stop here! Alcott's bibliography is full of expertly-written tales. Including some horror and supernatural. I'm a huge fan of her 1866 Gothic novel A Long Fatal Love Chase, which launches into action with the heroine willing to sell her soul to Satan ""for a year of freedom."""

I'm glad I can check this one off my list. I wish I had enjoyed it more. I was pretty bored after chapter two so I started to read online articles and other reviews. To find out the author confessed that he attempted to rape a girl named Nora (15) when he was 18 while home from his first year at Oxford made my skin crawl. He was sure the girl ""wanted heavy sex"". There are plenty of articles online with a simple search ""William Golding+rape"". Nobel Prize for Literature novelist, yea whatever. 

Another Golding confession was when he was a teacher, he got schoolboys to fight among themselves. Maybe that's the origin of Lord of the Flies? 

The audiobook on Libby/Overdrive read by the author was dreadful. I searched and found much superior narration on Youtube by Martin Jarvis. A disturbing story, more so because they were kids.

247,Ebster Davis,The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Jan 24, 2009",5,"I was introduced to The Lord of the Rings as the sequel to The Hobbit. I knew going into reading there wasn't going to be a lot of Bilbo, but that didn't stop me from reading ahead occasionally to see when his name would pop up next. 

Reading The Lord of the Rings was a really different experience from The Hobbit not only because it's got a more epic scope and deals with more POV characters, but also because I felt like it introduced me to ""Mr Tolkien"". Tolkien in The Hobbit is writing for an a particular audience (children and families), so he's catering his narrative delivery so hopefully it will resonate with those types of people. In The Lord of the Rings, I felt like the narrative was much less restrained in that way. The Lord of The Rings is much more pure expression of Mr Tolkien's personality and how he sees the world. 

Some of his perceptions were really surprising to me. I'm a modern day person and I use a computer and a car on a daily basis and, you know, it's easy to just take it for granted that that's the way the world works. Tolkien, though, is kind of a naturalist: his focus is on stuff like landscapes and plants, and on people being a part of it all. It's a totally different perspective on life than I would normally think of, and it was a treasure to be introduced to it. (view spoiler)[ How do my machines serve me? Or do I serve my machines? Am I using them to live a fuller, more human, life and in accordance with the laws of nature?  (hide spoiler)]

There's also this really funny thing he does whenever Aragorn shows up (this is particularly prominent in the first book): Mr Tolkien will drop whatever other narrative weave he's working on and enter fanboy mode and remind us how frikkin' awesome Strider/Aragorn is! 

It became a laughing point for me on my first reading; like, obviously ""This guy [the writer] wants me to like Aragorn, but you know....I kinda like Boromir better!""

(I was not surprised at all with Boromir's ending, it was actually kind of funny and sad at the same time.)

I also think it's interesting, that he's equally good at writing these big epic-scope sequences as he as at writing really quiet ones. One of the scenes I remember most vividly is when the whole Fellowship is just walking along a road somewhere, and he describes how the footfalls of each race of character sound differently. He just creates these moments and moods, you feel like you could just stay in them forever.


Notes:

I was in the second half of The Two Towers when I found out there were going to be movies about the series. We went to costco one time and they had a trilogy boxed set (along with The Hobbit). that was my first exposure to the movie and merchandise; 

(And of course Aragorn's there, right on the front cover, because we KNOW how much MR TOLKIEN LUUURVES him some Aragorn!)

I remember being so surprised,that they made the character who was clearly meant to be Frodo so good looking, and then reading the bit where Sam and Faramir are talking and mention that Frodo kind of looks like an elf. (Like, Mr Tolkien didn't think that this was important enough to mention earlier?! COMON!)

Also, I hadn't thought of elves as particularly effimate. The hobbit's just focus on how tall they are, and I guess I equated ""Tall"" with having a larger, more bulky skeletal structure. When you think about it, though, most of the POV characters are really, really short. Everyone is ginormous compared to them. And Mr Tolkien is just as likely to describe the elves as ""fair"" as he is to describe their height. Most of the time, I just thought he meant ""light colored"" but it makes sense with all the different races of elves, not all of them have to even be white."

I know this is a much loved children's classic that has been published in pretty much every language there is. As such, I'm not pretentious enough to think my thoughts on it matter, so I'll keep this short. 

I have challenged myself to read one classic a month this year, and so far, I am failing miserably. MISERABLY, you guys. It's July (almost August, but I'm throwing myself a bone so I feel like less of a loser) and I have only read two. This one and Peter Pan (of which I also completely missed the plot). And yes, I chose both of them because they are short. And geared for children. So I figured they would be easy to read. 

Wrong. 

I finished Alice in Wonderland on December 28th of 2017 (which I ALSO didn't love), after reading it over the course of almost a full month. If only I had really let my loser truly shine and work for me for once and waited three more days to finish it. Then I would at least be three for seven. 

But I digress. 

I'm starting to think children's classics might not be for me. At least not these whimsical, nonsensical, fable/allegory-style classics for which I am obviously too uncouth and unintelligent. Or whatever the case may be. Regardless, I am just finding them to be very boring and I just can't get into them. 

I'm gonna try Dorian Gray next though. NOT a children's classic. So hopefully I have more luck. 
 
Fingers crossed."

253,Julie G,The Little Prince,"Apr 01, 2019",5,"The Little Prince is the one book of my childhood that truly wrecked me. Wrecked me, irrevocably.

It is the one story that I swore I'd never read again.

I didn't. I hadn't. I never read it to my son, either.

Then, last week, my middle child, my oldest daughter, discovered the 2015 film of it, and came to me, sobbing, and said, ‚ÄúMommy, you've just got to watch this movie. It's so beautiful.‚Äù

I did. I watched it. It was a good movie, but, as usual, they added parts, they took away parts, they created violence where it wasn't necessary, etc. So, purist that I am, I marched into the library, checked out the book and told my girls, ‚ÄúIf you're going to know a story, then learn the original version.‚Äù

My hands were shaking this weekend, as I cracked the cover to read it, and the first thing I did was read the backflap, where I was reminded that the author himself went missing a year after the book was published in 1943. I immediately pictured Antoine De Saint-Exupery in his little airplane, crashing somewhere, alone, in the Mediterranean Sea. Pretty disturbing, if you know the premise of this fictional story. The tears started early.

I don't know what it is about these desert stories, but they wreck me, every time. I have never cried harder than after watching Ralph Fiennes in that red airplane, flying over the desert in The English Patient, or after meeting Claudia, in Moon Tiger, and realizing what she has lost, what she will never find again, in those desert sands.

The desert seems to magnify desolation, naturally, by its isolation. It can be a setting for great reflection, great stories, and even greater loss. And, it is here in this desert setting that our crashed pilot meets the little prince, whose life experiences illuminate almost every important lesson we could learn in a lifetime.

Of course I was crying again, but in a good way. 

I could just sit here, adding quote after quote from this book on this review. I could advise all men that everything they need to know about women is available to them in the passages between the little prince and the rose. I could advise all parents of young children that this is one of those rare books that reminds you how precious and fleeting your time is with your kids.

But, ‚Äúlanguage is the source of misunderstandings,‚Äù and I'd be better served to invite you to crash in the desert yourself. See if the little prince shows up to speak to you. See what he has to say."
254,Shannon,A Game of Thrones ,"Nov 17, 2011",5,"First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time. Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and cliched. So, when I came back to fantasy I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker!





Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who won't like this series:

WHY TO READ GRRM

(1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different . . . you get the idea. After reading this over and over, it gets old.

















(2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back.













This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished.

(3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR.





(4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is stupid or not too bright.





(5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint. Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing.





(6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we sometimes get different opinions.





(7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy. Almost flawless flow.

 ‚ÄúWhat is honor compared to a woman's love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms . . . or the memory of a brother's smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what's on the other side?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou are your mother's trueborn son of Lannister.""

""Am I?"" the dwarf replied, sardonic. ""Do tell my lord father. My mother died birthing me, and he's never been sure.""

""I don't even know who my mother was,"" Jon said. 

""Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are."" He favored Jon with a rueful grin. ""Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.""

And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. 

When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, my sweet summer child,"" Old Nan said quietly, ""what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods‚Äù 

(8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and intrigue.

(9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why each novel is between 700-900 pages.

(10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book three.













(11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done.

(12) HEAPS OF SYMBOLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that.





(13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels.

(14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think, too.






(15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it.





REASONS TO NOT READ GRRM

(1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so be warned.













(2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with strong archetypes.





(3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for you.





(4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life.





(5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.





(6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil.









(7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one or two characters.














(8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that case, look for shorters works as this is biiig.





(9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of power (one female exception).





STORY/PLOTTING: A minus; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: A minus to A; LEGENDS/WORLD BUILDING: A plus; FANTASY FOCUSES: A; OVERALL GRADE: A; WHEN READ LAST: 2009 (5 readings) (revised review April 2012; more pics added August 2013)"
255,Madeline,Wuthering Heights,"Apr 05, 2010",1,"If you've been following my status updates as I read this book, you can probably guess what kind of review this is going to be. (answer: the best kind!) So let's get the good stuff out of the way first, and then I can start the ranting. 

Good stuff: I liked some of the characters. Ellen was sweet, and seemed to be the only sensible person in the story. And lord, does she get put through a lot of shit. Girlfriend needs a hug and a spa weekend after all she's been through. I also liked Catherine II and Hareton - unlike their romantic predecessors (and believe me, we'll get to those two soon), they were likeable most of the time. Sure, they had their jackass moments, but considering their respective upbringings, can you really blame them? Also, they reminded me of Bender and Claire from The Breakfast Club. Like I said, kind of irritating and stupid, but sweet. 
I also appreciated the incredible passion of the story (and the passionate emotions it raised in me) Sure, I hated Heathcliff, but even I swooned a little during his final scene with Cathy. Sure, Emily Bronte has written the most terrifying portrayal of a love story I've ever seen (Fatal Attraction? Pfft.), but she did it really, really well. Terrifying as it is. Which brings me to the next section of this review...

Bad Stuff: I cannot, for the life of me, understand why anyone thinks this is a love story. It's a horror story of love and passion gone horribly, horribly wrong, and Heathcliff is one of the greatest villains ever created in literature. 
Notice I said ""villain"" and not ""antihero."" Heathcliff is not an antihero. He is a sociopath, and for the last fifty pages of the story I wanted to violently murder him so badly that my hands were shaking as I held the book. He is evil. 
Cathy doesn't get my sympathy, either. She was a spoiled, unfeeling bitch during every moment she was present in the story, and it's only because she was dead by page 200 that she didn't make me as angry as Heathcliff did - she simply didn't have enough time. 
But let's get back to Heathcliff - I cannot outline here all of the evil things he did over the course of the story, and to do so would probably be to give away spoilers. Let me just say this: I now understand completely why Wuthering Heights is being advertised in bookstores as ""Bella and Edwards Favorite Book!"". It should be. As I said in a comment on one of my statuses: Edward Cullen is good, but Heathcliff wrote the fucking book on Domestic Abuse Thinly Disguised As Love. 
I don't know why so many readers get all fangirly over Heathcliff. He's an asshole, a sociopath, and even he knows how evil he is. As he says of Isabella, a girl he marries and then treats so horribly I can't even talk about it right now: ""She abandoned them under a delusion...picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character, and acting on the false impression she has cherished.""

Hear that, Heathcliff fangirls? Even he thinks you're all morons for liking him. 

And, just to end this on a good note: I've shared this webcomic before, but it fits here too because, let's face it, the Bronte sisters had terrible taste in men."
256,Lyn,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Jul 30, 2011",4,"Don‚Äôt panic.

This is a wholly remarkable book.

For those of you who have NOT read Douglas Adams‚Äô classic, drop what you‚Äôre doing right this very instant and go get a book. You can buy a copy at the bookstore, download it from Kindle, or check it out at the library.

No, seriously, literally stop what you‚Äôre doing and go get a copy and do nothing for the next three to four hours as you read this brilliant and hilarious book. Go ahead, leave work, duck out of school, cancel that appointment and just read and enjoy. Tell them Dr. Johnny Fever has prescribed this and it is necessary for your health.

Go on, it‚Äôs OK, we‚Äôll wait for you.

(background music plays softly)

OK! You‚Äôre back! It was AMAZING! RIGHT?

Douglas Adams‚Äô takeoff from this great start is something to read. SF? Sure. Fantasy? Probably. Adams humorous writing and good as pizza dialogue makes this GREAT. I‚Äôd call this a lovingly fun satire of 60s era weird SF, with some fun science of his own, but all tongue in cheek and entertaining.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"

The animals of a farm, tired of the continuous abuses of human beings, decide to rebel. And after chasing the owner, they try to create a new order based on an ideological concept of equality. It looks like a fairy tale, but it's not to entertain the little ones. Mainly, Orwell explored a historical fact through this story. 

The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which."

1. A sharp and intelligent heroine with just the right amount of emotion who gives in to absolutely nothing and no one? 

2. A sweet and sensitive hero who loves and supports the heroine unconditionally? 

3. An original setting with a unique and thrilling plot? 

4. A couple of earth-shattering shocks every now and then to keep the readers' mind reeling? 

5. Extraordinary side characters from interesting backgrounds who possess the much-needed Voice of Reason and/or Humor in every crisis? 

6. Desperate circumstances that force me to bite my nails in anxiety? 

7. An ending that provides the perfect premise for the sequel but also concludes the present book?

260,mark monday,Divergent ,"Jun 21, 2013",2,"Dear Hunger Games,

I miss you. I really do. Our relationship is over and done with but the memory of you still lingers on. I know that's a terrible clich√© - and you hate clich√©s - but it's a true one, at least in this case. I don't think I'll ever be over you. You are fucking special.

It took me some time, but I finally met a new girl. Her name is Divergent. She's quiet and strong and short-tempered and insular and brave... a lot like you, I suppose. But is she really? This is hard for me to admit but I think I was initially attracted to her because she reminded me so much of you. I know it's not fair for me to think this way, I should be looking at her on her own merits. At the very least I could have looked at the relationship as a fun rebound and not as a search for a replacement you. Easier said than done. I loved you, I love you, I'll always love you... and I'm not sure I even like her.

First of all, she copies all of your moves and all of your traits. It's so obvious. It's clear she's modeled her whole life on you and what you've achieved. At first that similarity is what caught my eye about her. And she is an exciting person, she's always hurtling forward, she barely stops to take a breath. I like that. But in the end, there's also a fakeness and even a kind of desperation. She's not you, not even close. Why can't she be her own person?

Unlike you, she's really into guns. I know you see the necessity of guns, sometimes, but I also know you don't see them as an answer. I didn't mind her love of guns at first - I kinda like guns, I'll admit that. But eventually I realized she was equating the use of guns with bravery. What the hell? On the one hand she says ""true bravery is selflessness"" but on the other hand she insists that she doesn't feel fully herself unless she has a gun in her hand. Ugh.

She also has a thing against intellectuals. She finds them innately suspicious and they are the first kind of person she'll automatically reject. Honestly I don't know where that comes from. But it makes my skin crawl.

With all the gun love and the anti-brains bias, she reminds me at times of my redneck relatives. Which is not attractive.

The worst thing - and I know I'm about to sound like a real dick here - is that I've realized she is actually pretty stupid. She breaks people down into different groups, just like you do. But while you have a realistic, complicated perspective on class and power and economics and the media and self-awareness and how all of those things contribute to the boxes we put ourselves into, the decisions we make, who we are... she just divides people up into a handful of finite personality traits. Abnegation, Candor, Erudite, Dauntless, and Amity. it's such a ridiculous, shallow idea. My God, she even lumps adjectives and nouns together as her labels - as if they were the same thing! It's teeth-grindingly naive and yet this idea of hers is her whole foundation. Even worse, she seems to think that only the very rare person, the very special few, are able to combine these traits in relatively equal proportions. To be ""Divergent"". Sometimes I wonder if she's actually ever really known a person. Her theory is like something a child thought up.

Okay now I'm feeling bad for bashing her so much so I'll say some good things. She can be pretty enthusiastic and, at her best, she can keep me up all night just having fun. Her insights about this guy Al (you don't know him and you probably wouldn't like him) are really surprising and deep. So she's not that shallow, not really. She has her moments. And just like you, she sure knows how to make some money.

Still, I don't think I will be continuing the relationship. There's a new girl I've met named Daughter of Smoke & Bone. She seems really cool and smart and mysterious. I'm looking forward to getting to know her.

But in the end, you know you'll always be number one.

Much love,






UPDATE 10/17/14: just saw the movie. it was awesome!"
261,K.,Little Women,"Nov 16, 2016",2,"Look, I'm going to be brutally honest here: I read this when I was about 10 and I quite enjoyed it. But reading it at the age of 33? OH MY GOD, THIS WAS THE MOST SACCHARINE SWEET, INTOLERABLE TWADDLE I'VE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF READING. 

All four of the girls are so ridiculously perfect that even when they make the tiny little mistakes that are painted as monumental fuck ups in the book, they're instantly fixed with a sweet smile or a sermon from their mother about women needing to control their anger, or remembering how NICE it is to be poor. 

As the girls get older, they become slightly less insufferable but I gave zero fucks about any of their romantic relationships and I just wanted (view spoiler)[Beth to hurry up and die because she was so perfect and so insufferable and I kind of wanted to punch her in the face (hide spoiler)]. 

So. This is really a one star book that gets an extra star because Jo was actually a half way decent character most of the time and up until a certain point in the story, I had a very nice asexual Jo March headcanon going on."
262,Tim,The Outsiders,"Feb 13, 2022",4,"In my review of Rumble Fish I said that I had no intention of reading The Outsiders‚Ä¶ and here we are not having had a full year pass and I've read The Outsiders. How did this happen? Well, for one thing I saw the film The Outsiders for the first time and was shocked by how much I enjoyed it. Second I stumbled upon this in a buy two get one free book deal and decided that for free I'd give it a shot. 

Fine then, I'll read it but I probably won't like it!

...

Okay, I liked it. 

Had I not known Rumble Fish was the later work, I would have assumed this was. It's a much more confident and skillfully crafted work. The other was more experimental at times (which I for one applaud) but it felt like occasionally the author didn't know where things were going to go. This is far from the case here. This one feels carefully put together, with a clear intention of start, finish and everything in between. There's a couple of really clever bits of foreshadowing in some of the early lines and a lot of beautifully described scenes. The voice here is confident and appealing.

This is even more shocking to me because apparently Hinton started writing this book when she was only 15. The book was published when she was 18. While it is not the greatest written piece of literature in the world, I can imagine very few authors pulling off such a work at such a young age. Especially capturing this much depth in her characters. 

I won't say I have no intention of reading any more of Hinton's books in the future, at this point it would just be tempting fate to prove me wrong, but for now I am satisfied. 4/5 stars.

264,John Wiswell,1984,"Aug 12, 2007",2,"1984 is not a particularly good novel, but it is a very good essay. On the novel front, the characters are bland and you only care about them because of the awful things they live through. As a novel all the political exposition is heavyhanded, and the message completely overrides any sense of storytelling. As an essay, the points it makes can be earthshaking. It seems everyone who has so much as gotten a parking ticket thinks he lives in a 1984-dystopia. Every administration that reaches for power, injures civil liberties or collaborates too much with media is accused of playing Big Brother. These are the successes of 1984's paranoia, far outliving its original intent as a battery against where Communism was going (Orwell was a severely disappointed Marxist), and while people who compare their leaders to Big Brother are usually overreaching themselves and speak far away from Orwell's intent and vision, it is a useful catchcloth for dissent. Like so many immortalized books with a social vision, 1984's actual substance is so thin that its ideologies and fear-mongering aspects can be stretched and skewed to suit the readers. If you'd like a better sense of the real world and Orwell's intents, rather than third-hand interpretations of his fiction, then his Homage to Catalonia is highly recommended."

A great problem that emerges from the corporations controlling all democratic European and the US governments, probably the Asian, South American ones, Australia, etc. too, is that they actively promote any kind of authoritarian leadership in countries they have economic interests in, thereby actively helping in spreading Big Brother. Exaggeration? Sadly a clear nope, read Chomsky, Klein, Colin Crouch, Ziegler, Shiva Vandana, etc., all the critical, unheard voices denouncing neoliberalism, neoconservatism, neocolonialism, and globalization. Or call me a leftist conspiracist and trust politicians and journalists, far more easygoing. I should really consider to stop committing thoughtcrimes.

‚ÄùWhat dreadful nonsense we are talking!‚Äù - 
 
Alice concludes amidst a typically bizarre and directionless conversation with the Red and White Queens.

Wrong again, Alice! ‚ÄúReally you are very dull!‚Äù For it is, in actual fact the most wonderful kind of nonsense; that unpredictable, dream-like absurdity that one only finds in exceptional works of surrealist fiction.


It seems both ‚ÄòAlice in Wonderland‚Äô (1865) and ‚ÄòThrough the Looking Glass‚Äô (1871), along with the life of Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) himself, have been turned inside-out in a manic search for a definitive hidden meaning, allegorical or otherwise, to neatly attach to the two works. The author's close association with George MacDonald (a prolific author of allegorical fiction), Carroll being a satirist himself and the fact that, you know, Alice does indulge in some questionably-sourced, mind-altering consumables and converse with a blue hookah-smoking Caterpillar who persuades her to eat magic(al) mushroom causing further hallucinations, all lead me to believe that the abundance of analysis is likely justified. 

‚ÄòAlice in Wonderland‚Äô began, however, as a children‚Äôs story written for Carroll‚Äôs eight-year-old acquaintance and photography subject, Alice Pleasance Liddell. Carroll was well known for telling stories to the children in his parish and it becomes clear as early as the first book, but particularly in ‚ÄòThrough the Looking Glass‚Äô that he truly lamented the inevitability of growing up and losing one‚Äôs innocence and imagination. In keeping with the irrational depth of analysis performed on this work, does Alice not cry so much, as she grows (up), that she nearly drowns in her own tears? In a way, these works are Carroll‚Äôs prosaic ode to the pure, unadulterated imagination of children.

‚ÄùIt brings a tear
Into my eyes
When I begin
To realize
I've cried so much
Since you've been gone
I guess I'll drown in my own tears‚Äù
- Ray Charles

It‚Äôs not just pure imagination though; Carroll attempts, with resounding success, to imitate a dream-like state which is of course not exclusive to children but to all of us; the one time our sub-conscious is permitted to run amuck, on night release from the prison that is the rational mind! The disorientation that Alice experiences with her surroundings, the morphing environments, shapeshifting characters, the non-linear timeline, the universal state of free-association; these are all characteristics of the unfettered dreaming mind.



‚Äù[Alice‚Äôs sister] pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.‚Äù



I think it‚Äôs an absolutely charming tale for adults and children alike, particularly those with a fondness for surrealist humour. The copy I read was the 2019 Harper Design edition with illustrations by the MinaLima graphic design studio. The illustrations are great but I read this on Kindle and have since seen images of the physical Hardcover which is obviously much more vibrant not being black and white, as well as having interactive elements, so if you do read this edition, go for the physical copy if possible! I‚Äôll probably get a copy myself; with so much to love about the story, not least of all the quirky cast of characters, this one lends itself almost too perfectly to a daddy-daughter read! 
Hasta la proxima chamos! 



And, though the shadow of a sigh
May tremble through the story,
For ‚Äúhappy summer days‚Äù gone by,
And vanish‚Äôd summer glory--
It shall not touch with breath of bale,
The pleasance of our fairy-tale."

I felt at the time there was no redeeming value in it for me. I was born on the outside trying my best to get in. I felt no sympathy for him at all. I didn't even find him funny.

271,leynes,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Jun 03, 2017",1,"/// gentle reminder that this is not the time to read this book ///

This is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.

And that really infiruates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve. 

Harper Lee's focus is purely white. While the white characters in this book are the subjects, who take action into their own hands, who suffer and make sacrifices, the Black characters in this book are objects. They have little to no agency. Things happen to them. They are harmless, defenseless, and just there ‚Äì waiting for the white knight hero, Atticus Finch, to save them. This book is a disgrace in the face of the Black liberation movements that existed back in the day, and the solidarity within Black communities. Black people stood up for themselves and fought for their rights, and only due to their voices, their protests, their sit-ins, their marches, their demonstrations, their conferences, was racial segregation made unconstitutional in the United States.

Black people, back then and now, know that Atticus Finch doesn't exist. And because no one put in better words than the one and only James Baldwin, I will quote a passage from one of his amazing interviews on the Dick Cavett Show in 1968. One could say that this is Baldwin's response to the cry of ""not all white people"": James Baldwin: I don't know what most white people in this country feel. But I can only conclude what they feel from the state of their institutions. I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know we have a Christian church which is white and a Christian church which is black. That says a great deal for me about a Christian nation. [...] I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me - that doesn't matter - but I know I'm not [allowed] in their union. I don't know whether the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know the real estate lobby is keeping me in the ghetto. I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools we have to go to. Now, this is the evidence. You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.This right here is what I'm talking about. To Kill A Mockingbird plays into this idealism. Although the book touches on the horrors of racism in the Deep South, it‚Äôs a strangely comforting read. A terrible injustice is done, but at the end the status quo is reassuringly restored. The final message is that most (white) people are nice when you get to know them. 

As a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the Black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the Black characters in this tale are sidelined. This story should be about them, because how else would you be able to convince the white moderate (in the 1960s) that Black people are actually people. The closest insight we get to a Black character is the family's cook Calpurnia. Calpurnia is in the fictional tradition of the ""happy black"", the contented slave ‚Äì the descendent of the ever-loyal Mammy in Gone With the Wind. And the rest of the Black community is depicted as a group of simple, respectful folk ‚Äì passive and helpless and all touchingly grateful to Atticus Finch ‚Äì the white saviour. We never see any of them angry or upset. We never see the effect of Tom Robinson‚Äôs death on his family up close ‚Äì we don't witness Helen, Tom's wife, grieving and Scout never wonders about his children. Their distress is kept at safe distance from the reader.

I was very angry after finishing this book, and I'm still angry up to this day. Not necessarily at Harper Lee, but at our society as a whole, and at our educational system. Why do we constantly uplift white narratives, whilst brushing over marginalized ones? Why aren't our kids reading If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin ‚Äì a book dealing with the exact same topic (a Black man getting falsely accused of raping a woman)? Why isn't Lorraine Hansberry required reading? Why are we still relying on white narratives, when talking about Black people and their struggles?

Since finishing this book, I started reading The History of Legal Education in the United States and I wanted to share some interesting facts, because I couldn't believe how absurd To Kill A Mockingbird was. This story is, supposedly, set in the Deep South in the 1930s, where Atticus Finch, our white saviour, takes it upon himself to defend a Black man at court. By the end of Lee's novel we are led to believe that Atticus had a great chance of actually getting Tom Robinson acquitted, if the latter had just been a ""good n*gger"" and didn't try to escape on his own. (Yes, I'm a little petty. I swear, I'm not turning bitter over this.) So, I just wanted to know how realistic that scenario is. All of the information is related to the 1930s Southern setting. Here's what I've learned:

Most Southern lawyers readily accepted Black clients for routine economic cases ‚Äì property, tort, contract, dept, insurance ‚Äì and minor criminal cases that did not threaten the South's system of racial hierarchy. It was virtually impossible, however, to find a Southern white lawyer who would accept a major criminal case involving a white victim or a politically charged case that in any way challenged segregation. 

Only the combination of direct action, community organizing and legal strategy with the help of Black lawyers, made the defense of Black men and women at court possible. In the Lockett-case, the Black community in Tulsa survived largely because Black lawyers were able to defend the community's interests. In 1934, Black lawyers represented George Crawford, a Black man accused of brutally murdering a wealthy white woman ‚Äì no white lawyer would take Crawford's case. In the end, Crawford got a sentence of life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. And this verdict had to be seen as an accomplishment by the Black lawyers and the Black community as a whole, because life imprisonment was as good as it was going to get. 

Oftentimes, Black lawyers took serious criminal cases without a fee or at a very reduced rate. This was well appreciated by their communities, but also a given. It is admirable how well Black communities were organized. None of that got translated on the pages of Lee's novel. The Black characters do absolutely nothing, except sending Atticus food, because they're so grateful. [*insert snort here*]

This book appears to uphold the standard of racial equality; de facto it is about the white middle class patting themselves on the back for not thinking racist thoughts. I'm sorry to break it to you, Miss Maudie, but you won't get a sugar cookie for that. I am not saying that this is not a realistic portrayal of the white middle class, it is, it totally is. If you do just a little research on the Civil Rights movement, the moral apathy of the white middle class becomes crystal clear. However, we shouldn't portray these characters in a positive light, there is nothing admirable about them. After all... He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against is really cooperating with it.

Charles had been writing prose and poetry since a very young age, but it was young Alice Liddell who encouraged him to write down the stories he had made up for her and her sisters, thus Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was published and has since been a stalwart in children's reading treasuries.

Charles, or more famously known by his alias Lewis Carroll, was an extraordinary man, graduating from Oxford with a first in Mathematics and going on to study and teach at Oxford, where he remained until his death in 1898. Not only did he write, but he was an early pioneer of photography and also painted. He predominantly wrote short stories and poems, but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was a longer version of his unique writing style, and was published in 1865 to great acclaim. He became famous almost over night and wrote the sequel Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, though this particular story seemed much darker than the much-loved Wonderland, most probably caused by the depression he felt after the death of his father in 1871. Sylvie and Bruno, a tale of fairy siblings is a lesser known story from Carroll in 1895 and did not fair as well as Alice ever did though it remains in print as a testimony to the wonderful writer Lewis Carroll was.

Lewis Carroll's writing is often described as surreal and nonsensical, a lot of his words are made up, but are used in today's language-think specifically of the poem Jabberwocky-and he has had almost as much impact on the way we use language as Shakespeare ever did. The word 'chortle' is used today as commonly as if it truly were a real word for laughing:


`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
 And the mome raths outgrabe.


""Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
 The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
 The frumious Bandersnatch!""

[...]

""And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
 Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
 He chortled in his joy.

In my most recent re-read of Alice, I decided I would read aloud the poetry within the book. There is a lot more poetry in it than I originally remembered, all of which is told to Alice by the various characters she meets. The made-up Carrollian words sound both strange and familiar on the tongue and one can find a genuine lilting rhythm to the entire book when experienced out loud with sound.

Beneath the surface, the story can be seen as quite dark, particularly the latter story Through the Looking-Glass. Whilst both retain the whimsical, surreal nature of another world, Looking-Glass has more of a sinister overtone, with more things going wrong for Alice and many more characters being unkind to one another. It also showed another side to Alice herself, as she had grown out of the rabbit hole and crying her way out of situations and instead wished more than anything to be a Queen. Her previous adventure with the Queen must have sparked this desire, though Alice had shown nothing but disdain for the Queen of Wonderland who wanted to chop everyone's head off at any given moment.

I found myself enjoying the latter book to the former: I cannot place my finger on the reason why, however. If nothing else, it is probably the more grown-up version of Alice I prefer, though in reality she is still just a child. Her experiences in her first Wonderland adventure seemed to have impacted her fervently, as she navigated the Looking-Glass Wonderland exceedingly well, often outsmarting those who were native to it.

The two books-often just collated in to one large one known as Alice in Wonderland-are actually all I've ever read of Lewis Carroll's works, though I am intrigued by his other works, particularly his poetry. The surreal, nonsense nature of the poetry in Alice is unique to Carroll and I'd be curious to see if it carries over in to his other works. Have you ever read his other works?

There is some controversy surrounded Lewis Carroll, mostly brought up in biographies of him, particularly regarding his friendliness with young girls such as the Liddell children, but I shan't be commenting on that here. Instead we shall concentrate on the great piece of literature he left behind, which he wrote whilst he was both disappointed and unhappy with his job of teaching at Oxford (despite remaining there until his death) and saddened by the loss of his mother early on in his life and by his father after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was published. It is too much to wonder whether the reputation of such an absorbing, wonderful book would be tarnished if his biographers ever learnt the exact truth of his nature and the absurdities of accusations are most likely driven by the era they find themselves in.

There are many events taking place in 2015 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of this wonderful, wondrous, wandering book all over the globe. Royal Mail are producing celebratory collection stamps in honour of the landmark and who can forget the wonderful (if rather libertarian) Disney film? The best thing you can do is to read and re-read this book an enjoy it for what it is: a beautifully written, surreal and nonsense book that has captivated the imaginations of children and adults alike.

273,Lu√≠s,Ratos e Homens,"Jun 26, 2020",4,"Of mice & men, by the modern American author John Steinbeck, is a powerful and moving analysis of life during the Depression of the American era. It deals with the lives of two ranch farm hands, Lennie and George. Lennie is a simple, backward man who is tall and powerful but kind. George is the brains of the outfit, who organizes and arranges for them to get work on the ranches and farms as they travel and dream of getting their place, where they can make some money, have a home, and where Lennie can have lots of rabbits to play with and stroke. 
The short novel is set out in acts as though it were a play and began with the two men having to run away from the ranch they are working at, as Lennie has gotten too fond of one of the women on the farm who was kind to him. As he is pure and likes soft things, he stroked the lady's dress and accused her of trying to attack her. They run off and hide until the men stop searching, then move on to another ranch where they have work lined up. 
Overall, the novel is about friendship, loneliness, plans, and broken dreams in Depression. It hits America in the '50s‚Äîa must-read."
274,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),The Great Gatsby,"Apr 05, 2020",5,"This is one of the best novels I read about the American dream. The prose is perfect in every way, and this novel's ending is one of the best endings I have ever read.

I first read Fitzgerald's masterpiece when I was a young teenager. After I finished reading it, I simply hated it. I had no clue why the people were so much obsessed with it. After many years I decided to give this novel another try when I started to hear my friends frequently discussing it. 

It took me almost ten years after the initial read to understand the beauty of this book. The manner in which the author wrote it can't be compared to any other literary creation. The symbolism in it makes it a true masterpiece that no one should miss.

So, my review might be a bit biased...

This was my first (and only major) episode of fangirling. 

I owned a tshirt (""vegetarian vampire""  - so edgy). 

I saw the first movie an embarrassingly high number of times in theater. 

I judged people based off of Team Edward or Team Jacob (for the record: Edward in the books, Jacob in the movies).

Even now, more than 10 years later, I still absolutely adore this first book - there's too many good feelings. 

I tried so, so hard to look at this book with my sophisticated grown-up eyes, to see past all the trite plotholes and develop a good, sound hatred of Twilight . 

I just can't - I live for this series. 

So, just keep in mind where I am coming from when I decided to reread this one. 

My overwhelming realization? Bella should probably be hospitalized

 There is no way she doesn't have some inner-ear or traumatic brain injury. There is no physically relevant way a seventeen year old could be that 
unbalanced.
 

 It defies all logic. It's like every time I turned the page, there'd she go. Falling. Again.
You really should stay away from me.
The other overwhelming realization? Rosalie was the voice of reason.

 I remember absolutely 
hating her
 because she was the only one who stood between Edward and Bella. 

How dare she not love that they're in love? Well, now that I'm older, it's more of 
 YOU'RE ONLY SEVENTEEN AND HE'S A HUNDRED YEARS OLDER.
 

Team Rosalie-the-voice-of-reason all the way.

Despite everything, the cheesy quotes, the terribly unrealistic portrayal of love and the big sparkling plot-holes, I can't help it. 
I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.

Me, falling in love with this book all over again. 
 P.s. Still got that 10 yr old vegetarian vampire shirt in the back of my closet.

P.p.s. yes. That's my original Twilight copy, literally worn away from my multiple rereads...

Audiobook Comments
Well-read by Ilyana Kadushin, though I wish the guy voices were a bit more distinct when the girl-reader said them. They were all just slightly deeper version of girl-voices. Not much variation in tone/inflection.

The 2018 PopSugar Reading Challenge - A book made into a movie you've already seen

276,Tadiana ‚ú©Night Owl‚òΩ,Romeo and Juliet,"Feb 11, 2013",4,"True confessions time: I've read Romeo and Juliet at least once, maybe more (probably it was in one of my college English courses) and mostly thought, great poetry, but GAH! silly kids! idiotic people! I've seen it on stage once or twice -- one production cast Romeo's family entirely with black actors and Juliet's family with white ones, to bring the feuding a little closer to home, I guess. It was interesting, but still, didn't really move me. I'm sure I teared up during the final scene, but I'm easy to manipulate emotionally that way. Books and movies make me cry All. The. Time. It's not a major achievement.

And then I saw the movie Shakespeare in Love (on cable TV, years after it was in the theaters). The movie has Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow doing numerous scenes from R&J together, not to mention a little Dame Judi Dench on the side, which always helps, and I totally ate it up. The actors were amazing, and it hit me right in the heart.

So all of that is to say that yes, Shakespeare is a genius, but sometimes it just takes the right set of actors in one of his shows to make you love it emotionally as well as intellectually. Which reminds me of my favorite actors ever in a Shakespeare production, Oberon and Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream ... but that's a different story."

278,Matthew,The Outsiders,"Feb 22, 2017",4,"Finally read this classic. Glad to be in the know!

I can see why this has stood the test of time. The story is easy to get into and keeps your attention throughout. It seems like any person, young or old, rich or poor, popular or outcast could empathize or sympathize the themes. Finally, the key climax points are done very well and hit you right in the feels!

Another thought I had while reading is this is another one of the young adult fore fathers. We now take for granted that every week there will be 10 new YA titles to pique our interest. Back when this came out, the YA gems were few and far between. Reading this should be a right of passage for YA fans everywhere."
279,Lyn,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Mar 09, 2012",4,"This was a really good book. 

On its surface it is a great story about a young boy who goes through tremendous struggles. On another level it is a brilliant psychological character study and an observation of group dynamics. On still another level it was an intelligent allegory for violence and bellicosity in ourselves and our society. 

There is a listopia list that calls this the best science fiction novel. 

Mmmmm, maybe. I can see why someone would say so. I have heard where military organizations have assigned this for cadet reading.

It is very good, certainly high in the running and on a short list of best ever. I will read more by Card and may read more of the Ender series."

If I ever had to choose to be another literary person than my beloved soulmate Don Quixote, it would have to be Alice in Wonderland. Why would I need to be another character than the one and only Don? Well, it is good to have a backup if you are asked to come to a masquerade as a favourite book character (a not completely unlikely risk and side effect of my profession), and you realise that your blonde hair and the emphasis on blue dresses in your wardrobe makes that a much more natural choice than the Medieval male dresscode of La Mancha.

On the other hand, Alice is a perfect complement to the Don in many ways. While he sets out to give the ordinary world some magic, she dives into Wonderland to make it sparkle with her common sense approach to madness. A perfect pair, those two characters. 



In times like these, they are needed more than ever, to fight the windmills or Jabberwockys of modern craziness. As coffee is a means of survival to me, and I like the idea of drinking it out of a mug featuring an illustration of a famous tea party - as nonsensical as most, but more fun - I once went to London and bought myself a Mad Hatter mug, the handle nicely formed like one of those keys Alice had such trouble with. The quote on the back of the mug has helped me (along with the caffeine and a sense of humour as dark as my no-milk-and-no-sugar coffee) survive many a lesson with teenagers:

""If you knew Time as well as I do,‚Äô said the Hatter, ‚Äòyou wouldn‚Äôt talk about wasting it.""



I know for a fact that this book can be reread as many times as needed to figure out your own identity and level of madness, without any waste of time whatsoever:

‚ÄúWho am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up; if not, I'll stay down here till I'm someone else.‚Äù

I can almost give the same promise that Milo got in The Phantom Tollbooth:

281,Annalisa,The Help,"Jun 17, 2009",5,"Here is an illustrative tale of what it was like to be a black maid during the civil rights movement of the 1960s in racially conflicted Mississippi. There is such deep history in the black/white relationship and this story beautifully shows the complex spectrum, not only the hate, abuse, mistrust, but the love, attachment, dependence. 

Stockett includes this quote by Howell Raines in her personal except at the end of the novel: There is no trickier subject for a writer from the South than that of affection between a black person and a white one in the unequal world of segregation. For the dishonesty upon which a society is founded makes every emotion suspect, makes it impossible to know whether what flowed between two people was honest feeling or pity or pragmatism. An eloquent way to describe Stockett's intentions for this novel. I know most reviews will probably focus on the racial relationships in the book, but to me the most haunting statement was that when you are paying someone to care for you and their livelihood depends on making you happy, you can't expect an honest relationship. 

I did not expect this book to hit so close to home. After all, I did not grow up in the South and completely missed the racial mind shift in the country. But the book isn't just about racism and civil rights. It's about the employer relationship too. And I did grow up in South America with a maid trying to keep herself out of poverty by making our crazy family happy. As much as we loved her, I can see so many of the pitfalls from these complex relationships in my own history. I know our maid was stuck between pleasing my mother and raising us the way she believed appropriate. I know it was physically hard to work from sunup to late everyday and emotionally hard to never relax because she wasn't the decision maker of our home and at any moment she could be reprimanded for making the wrong decision. She had absolutely no power, and yet she was all powerful to shape and mold us. 

I needed her, felt bad for how much I imposed upon her, but I never voiced how much I appreciated or loved her. I took her for granted. Even though she was paid to love us, I know she did. We were her children, especially my youngest brothers. And yet when she moved back home, we lost contact. Was it out of laziness of our own narcissistic lives or was the complexity of our relationship so draining she cut the tie? It is my fear that she thinks we did not return her affection and only thought of her as the maid. I often think about her, we all reminisce about her wondering where she is, and more than anything, I just want to know that she is happy and tell her thank you. It is so strange that someone who is such a vital part of your childhood can just vanish out of your life. ""They say its like true love, good help. You only get one in a lifetime."" I know. Believe me, I know.

The story is strong and real and touched something deep inside me. I could so relate to the motherly love from Constantine to Skeeter, see that pain in the triangle between Aibileen and Mae Mobley and Elizabeth, feel the exasperation of Minny toward Celia, and understand the complexity of the good and bad, the love and hate, the fear and security. Stockett captured all these emotions.

I also loved the writing style. When style compliments plot, I get giddy. I don't always love grammatically incorrect prose or books about an author trying to be published, but here it works because it's honest. The novel is about a white woman secretly compiling true accounts of black maids--and the novel is in essence a white author trying to understand black maids. The styles parallel each other as do the messages. The point of Skeeter's novel is to make people see that people are just people no matter the color of their skin and Stockett's novel beautifully portrays that with both good and bad on both sides. The fictional novel cover is decorated with the white dove of love and understanding. To get us there, Stockett gives us three ordinary birds, a picture of ordinary life asking to be accepted for its honest simplicity. 

This book is Stockett's masterpiece, that story in her that was just itching to get out. From the first page, the voice of the characters took vivid form and became real, breathing people. I loved Aibileen, but think I loved Minny's voice more because she is such a strong character. Besides the maids, I loved Hilly as a portrayal of the white Southern belle with the ingrained belief that black people are not as good as whites, verbalized as ""separate but equal"" so it doesn't sound racist. My favorite scene was when Hilly says they have to be careful of racists because they are out there. She's a bit over the top, but if you've been to the South, not that far of a stretch. I just would have liked to find some redeeming qualities in her from Skeeter's perspective. 

While there are some instances where I felt Stockett was squeezing historical facts into the novel, forming the plot around these events instead of letting them play backdrop, and occasionally I could read the modern woman in this tale pushing her message too hard, Stockett's sincerity to understand and appreciate shines through. She lived this book to some extent and the story is a part of her. Because it's important to her it becomes important to me."
282,MischaS_,Brave New World,"Jul 11, 2020",4,"Back in high school, one of the teachers brought a little sample from this book, and I found it totally captivating. Terrifying but at the same captivating. 

So, I went back to it. 


‚ÄúOne believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.‚Äù



The beginning is totally the strongest part of this book, as it progresses, it goes a bit down. But at the same time, I think that the beginning is the hardest to get over. The world is being introduced to us in a rather raw way which definitely has the potential to make people uneasy. And while it was hard to read but it was also fascinating in a way. You do not like what you see, but you cannot look away. 

However, the book gave me chills; it's definitely not a ""summer-read"", it's quite a bit to unpack and get over what's happening. 

Side note, I just hope that no one ever looks at this book and thinks that it's a great idea. THAT would be terrifying."
283,Danielle,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jan 18, 2008",1,"Why can't there be a negative star rating? I hated, hated this book. And yes, I did finish it. All way-too-many pages of it. But, in my defense it was (foolishly) the only book I brought with me when I was hospitalized for 24 hours after wisdom tooth surgery, and when your options are daytime soaps or this wretched book...well, at least I got to read the ending and conclude definitively that it wasn't worth it. Okay, now that I've gotten a bit of a rant out, let me be a little more organized about my dislikes:
1. The sex. More accurately, the sex after sex after sex, in graphic detail (not pornographic detail, granted, but WAY more than I wanted to picture), at all sorts of different ages. Wow. Yeah, I just hated that. If it serves a purpose to the plot, fine, include it, but don't give me every single move. I just don't need to know that.
2. The plot was convoluted. I can say this fairly because I read it in practically one sitting, and while I was able to keep things straight, it would have served the book better to not attempt to take in so many sub-plots and minutia. 
3. Okay, I will admit that for having a sci-fi premise, the concept of time travel as outlined here was at least moderately believable. What I didn't like was that it wasn't especially original (anyone seen Journeyman?) yet had the pretension that it was.
4. The whole crux of the novel was the great love story between Henry and Claire. Yet, as a reader I'm much more interested and moved by two NICE people ending up together, and staying together, than two people I just don't like that much. Let's face it, Henry is not a great guy. And there's that whole poor-rich-girl thing going on with Claire. I just wasn't feeling it.
Okay, all of that said, I really don't recommend this book to anyone. I realize there are a lot of people that like it (I know; I checked the reviews expecting to be completely vindicated, but alas, it seems I'm in the minority) but those people who like it apparently enjoy a different class of book than I do. There are so many great works out there, why waste your time with this?"

Read me, love me, touch me, treasure me

This is a book about the power of books that is itself steeped with references, both explicit and indirect, to the great works that permeate our culture so thoroughly that we do not always notice them - until they‚Äôre gone. Bradbury shows us the horror of a hedonistic but unhappy world where books and ideas are banned in the futile pursuit of the illusion of happiness. As with A Clockwork Orange (see my review HERE), there is a constant tension between the deliciously poetic language and the horrors of the setting. 

The intended message of this 62-year-old novel is different: a prescient warning about the addictive power of continuous, passive imbibing from the virtual worlds and interactive screens that are our constant companions. I guess Bradbury was so infused in bookish culture himself that he didn‚Äôt realise how loudly the literary message shouts from every page, almost drowning out everything else: read me, love me, touch me, treasure me. Reading is a physical, sensual, transformative relationship, not merely a mental process. See this excellent article (thanks, Apatt!) for Bradbury's views on the persistent misinterpretation of his book: LA Weekly article. It's interesting to compare this with his Usher II, where books are burned for the opposite reason: to make people face reality by quashing imagination. See my review HERE.

Nevertheless, the balance of themes is shifting: smartphones and the Internet of Things mean we‚Äôre catching up with Bradbury‚Äôs vision. Certainly, I was more aware of his technological warning than on previous readings - but it‚Äôs still the insatiable thirst for what is in and from books (ideas, discussion, and knowledge) that stokes my passion for this novel:
‚ÄúThe magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us.‚Äù
As Henry Cowles wrote in Aeon recently, ‚ÄúScreens are not just a part of life today: they are our lives.‚Äù

The weak characterisation, cruelly caricatured Mildred, and the rationale and details of the totalitarian state‚Äôs oppression, censorship (sadly apt after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris in January 2015), and warmongering are secondary - just the canvas on which Bradbury delicately paints his nightmare, by moonlight, to the pitter-patter of raindrops and the whisper of falling leaves. 

tl;dnr - stick with the four paragraphs, above.


Plot and Narrative Structure

The plot is well-known: It is set in the near future, where all books are banned because they are elitist and hence cause unhappiness and division. Instead, the population is fed continuous inane soap operas to lull their minds into soporific approximation of non-unhappiness. TV really does rot their brains, or at least sap their ability to think for themselves. Firemen no longer put out fires, but instead burn houses where books are found. 

Montag is a fireman, so part of the regime. But he is tempted by the unknown promise of what he destroys, takes greater and greater risks, and ends up a fugitive, living rough with other rebels, each of whom has memorised a book so that when things change, they can be rewritten. (Ironically, these people also destroy books - just the physical ones, after they have memorised them.)

There are three parts: 

1.	‚ÄúIt Was a Pleasure to Burn‚Äù shows the restrictions of Montag‚Äôs world, and his growing, but unfocused, dissatisfaction with it, contrasted with beautiful imagery of the natural world, especially moonlight and trees - and fire.
2.	‚ÄúThe Sieve and the Sand‚Äù is about confrontation: with self and others - with truth.
3.	Finally, in ‚ÄúBurning Bright‚Äù, revelation leads to liberation, danger, and the possibility of freedom. But at what cost? 

QUOTES

I had forgotten (or maybe never noticed!) how wonderful the language is. This review is even more focused on quotes than usual, so I never forget.

Contradictions

Mechanical Hound

This thing, this high-tech version of the most atavistic, omnipotent monsters that plague our dreams from infancy, is where Bradbury‚Äôs hybrid of beauty and horror reaches its peak:

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe moonlight‚Ä¶ touched here and there on the brass and the copper and the steel of the faintly trembling beast. Light flickered on bits of ruby glass and on sensitive capillary hairs in the nylon-brushed nostrils of the creature that quivered gently, gently, gently, its eight legs spidered under it on rubber-padded paws.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOut of the helicopter glided something that was not machine, not animal, not dead, not alive, glowing with a pale green luminosity.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHe could feel the Hound, like autumn, come cold and dry and swift, like a wind that didn't stir grass‚Ä¶ The Hound did not touch the world. It carried its silence with it.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúLaughter blew across the moon-colored lawn.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThey read the long afternoon through while the cold November rain fell from the sky in the quiet house. They sat in the hall because the parlour was so empty and gray-looking without its walls lite with orange and yellow confetti.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou could feel the war getting ready in the sky that night. The way the clouds moved aside and came back, and the way the stars looked, a million of them swimming between the clouds‚Ä¶ and the feeling that the sky might fall upon the city and turn it to chalk dust, and the moon go up in red fire.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe river was mild and leisurely, going away from the people who ate shadows for breakfast and steam for lunch and vapours for supper.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe more he breathed the land in, the more he was filled up with all the details of the land. He was not empty.‚Äù

Burned Books as Once-Living Things

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThey fell like slaughtered birds and the woman stood below, like a small girl, among the bodies.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe books lay like great mounds of fishes left to dry.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúTheir covers torn off and spilled out like swan-feathers.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe books leapt and danced like roasted birds, their wings ablaze with red and yellow feathers.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúLight the first page, light the second page. Each becomes a black butterfly.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe floor littered with swarms of black moths that had died in a single storm.‚Äù

Fire

If BuzzFeed is to believed (a medium-sized ""if"", imo), its original title was not ""Fahrenheit 451"", but ""The Fireman"". He and his publishers thought it a boring title, so they called a local fire station and asked what temperature paper burned at. The firemen put Bradbury on hold while they burned a book, then reported back the temperature, and the rest is history.

‚Ä¢	The opening sentence: ‚ÄúIt was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. with this brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe books went up in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned dark with burning.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThose who do not build must burn.‚Äù (Do they ignite the fire, or are they consumed by it?)
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perpetual motion; the thing man wanted to invent but never did.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúA bloom of fire, a single wondrous blossom that curled in petals of yellow and blue and orange.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	A bonfire, ‚Äúwas not burning; it was warming... He hadn‚Äôt known fire could look this way. He had never thought‚Ä¶ it could give as well as take.‚Äù

The descriptions of fire are also the best feature of Bradbury's short story A Sound of Thunder which I reviewed HERE.

Dangers of Books

Many of the reasons given could just as easily apply to TV shows; Faber says as much to Montag, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not books you need, it‚Äôs some of the things that once were in books‚Äù and that those same things could be in the TV shows, but aren‚Äôt. Instead, the TV shows are specially designed to numb minds to all except vague pleasure. 

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúBooks aren‚Äôt people‚Ä¶ my family [soap stars] is people‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúNone of these books agree with each other‚Ä¶ The people in those books never lived.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt come from the government down‚Ä¶ Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick‚Ä¶ Today‚Ä¶ you can stay happy all the time‚Äù because only comics, confessions and trade journals are permitted.
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe firemen are rarely necessary. The public stopped reading of its own accord.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWe must all be alike. Not everyone was born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal‚Ä¶ Then all are happy‚Äù, protected from the ‚Äúrightful dread of being inferior‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOur civilization is so vast that we can‚Äôt have our minorities upset and stirred‚Äù, so everything that might upset anyone is destroyed.
‚Ä¢	Filled with facts, people ‚Äúfeel they‚Äôre thinking‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll be happy because facts of that sort don‚Äôt change.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúAll the silly things the words mean, all the false promises, and all the second hand notions and time-worn philosophies.‚Äù

Dangers of VR

There is bitter irony in a ‚Äúliving room‚Äù where the only ‚Äúliving‚Äù is that of fictitious people, passively observed on the huge screens on the walls.

‚Ä¢	Entering the bedroom ‚Äúwas like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum after the moon had set.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHer eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound‚Ä¶ coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt talk about anything‚Ä¶ They name a lot of cars or clothes or swimming-pools and say how swell.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Brainwashing: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always someone else‚Äôs husband dies.‚Äù and ‚ÄúNothing will ever happen to me.‚Äù

General Quotes

‚Ä¢	Clarice‚Äôs face had ‚Äúa kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHe felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	A stomach pump: ‚Äúlooking for all the old water and old time gathered there‚Ä¶ Did it drink of the darkness?... The impersonal operation‚Ä¶ could gaze into the soul of the person whom he was pumping out.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe world had melted down and sprung up in a new and colorless formation.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHe slapped her face with amazing objectivity.‚Äù (It is not being condoned.)
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúShe made the empty rooms roar with accusation and shake down a fine dust of guilt that was sucked into their nostrils and they plunged about.‚Äù That‚Äôs why owners shouldn‚Äôt be present.
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúTime has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine.‚Äù A line from a poem by Alexander Smith that Montag glimpses, ‚Äúbut it blazed in his mind for the next minutes as if stamped there with fiery steel.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHis hand had been infected [by picking up a book], and soon it would be his arms. He could feel the poison working up‚Ä¶ His hands were ravenous. And his eyes were beginning to feel hunger, as if they must look at something, anything, everything.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt talk things‚Ä¶ I talk the meanings of things.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIf you read fast and read all, maybe some of the sand will stay in the sieve.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThey were like a monstrous crystal chandelier tinkling in a thousand chimes, he saw their Cheshire Cat smiles burning through the walls.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	""There was a crash like falling parts of a dream fashioned out of warped glass, mirrors, and crystal prisms.""
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWe cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over.‚Äù From Boswell‚Äôs The Life of Samuel Johnson.
‚Ä¢	A buzzing helicopter ‚Äúlike butterflies puzzled by autumn‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	A ten-lane highway: ‚ÄúA boatless river frozen there in the raw light of the high white arc-lamps; you could drown trying to cross it.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHis nose was suddenly good enough to sense the path he had made in the air of the room.‚Äù

Homework

I choose to inhale and absorb the atmosphere of the book, without stopping every few sentences to investigate each possible reference and quote, but those who enjoy literary detective work will find plenty of material here. 

The other mystery is Captain Beatty: he is remarkably well-versed in the classics of literature, philosophy and history. ‚ÄúI was using the very books you clung to, to rebut you‚Ä¶ What traitors books can be.‚Äù But is that explanation enough?

What Book Would You Be for Posterity?

The obvious question is, if you were going to become a book and memorise it for posterity, what would you choose? Would it be cheating to pick ""Fahrenheit 451""? Should it be for personal comfort or something that will be useful in rebuilding society?

The hardest questions is, would you give up everything for literature?

‚ÄúAll we can do is keep the knowledge‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre no more than dust jackets for books, of no significance otherwise‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not important. You‚Äôre not anything. Some day the load we‚Äôre carrying with us may help someone.‚Äù When people ask what we do, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre remembering‚Äù.

In Summary

I love the fact that this book is a paean to the power of the written word: that people will live and die for it, and will wither without the transformative power of fictional worlds and the insights of others. The lure and love of literature is irrepressible. Books ""stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us.""

Postscript

Related to this - and to 1984 - Derek (Guilty of thoughtcrime) wrote in a group discussion: 
""There's a distinct echo in both books of the Garden of Eden story, with Eve tempting Adam to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And in each case, it's a denial of the dogma that this is the original sin.""

Film Adaptations

1966 Film - Watch

Truffaut's 1966 version is visually stunning and broadly faithful to the book. See details on imdb here.

Riffing on This and Truffaut
See Megan Dunn‚Äôs brilliant first book, Tinderbox, which I reviewed HERE. She intended to rewrite 451 from the point of view of the female characters, but ended up equally fascinated by Truffaut's adaptation - the very process of adapting the book. The result is a fascinating, personal, and funny exploration of her attempts to adapt someone else‚Äôs work. It also includes many fascinating and sometimes surprising details about the film, such as Truffaut hand-picking the books that were burned in the opening scene.

2018 Film - Avoid

Adapting a book for screen can excuse or require changes. But the 2018 one was a travesty that exacerbates the common misunderstanding of Bradbury's intended message AND adds a ludicrous new plot in its place. There is nothing at all about the addictive and mind-numbing allure of superficial soap operas (Montag doesn't even have a wife), but there is a weird sciency thing about books being encoded in the DNA of a bird, so they'll live for ever! It wasn't even well acted or written (I presume it didn't improve in the second half). See details on imdb here."
285,Michael Finocchiaro,Charlotte's Web,"Oct 02, 2016",5,"One of the great tear-jerkers of my long-lost childhood, the unlikely friendship between a spider and a pig makes for wonderful reading and a shared moment of love when reading it to kids. It is tender and teaches the values of constancy and integrity in a light, beautiful prose. A classic and a masterpiece."
286,Catriona,Romeo and Juliet,"May 18, 2011",5,"The people who dislike this play are the ones who view common sense over being rational, and prefer to view the world in a structured way. One of the main arguments that come across is the 'meeting, falling in love, and dying all in a weekend when Juliet is but 13'. We all must die in the end, so wouldn't you want to in the name of love than of an awful disease? 
Perhaps the two lovers weren't truly in love, but their last living moments were spent believing so, so what does it matter? How can one truly know if one is in love? Is it a feeling? In that case, what is a feeling? If you believe you are in love, then you may as well be, contrary to what others might say.
The argument with the 'weak' plot; Shakespeare didn't invent Romeo and Juliet. It was infact a poem which is constantly being adapted over time. Shakespeare did add in some aspects but the meeting in the ballroom, Tybalts death, the sleeping draught and such were already in the poem.

I personally love this play, purely because it's an escape from this modern world. I'm not saying I like the treatment of women, nor the fighting, but it's like a different world that i'm never going to experience, and reading it through Shakespeare's gorgeous writing makes Verona seem all the more romantic."

The Written Review
: 

‚ÄúHappy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.‚Äù
Every year, Panem (post-apacolyptic North America) hosts a Hunger Games involving one female and one male representative from each of its twelve districts to fight to the death. 

All of the Districts of Panem must watch the Games as a form of yearly ""entertainment"" when in actuality, it's a power play put on by the Capitol (the wealthiest of the districts).
For there to be betrayal, there would have to have been trust first.
The Capitol uses the Games as a way to demonstrate the sheer helplessness of the other Districts and to keep the population cowed and in fear.

When Katniss's sister (twelve-year-old Prim) is chosen as this year's competitor, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Peeta, a boy from the ""richer"" side of District 12 is chosen as the male representative.
I'm more than just a piece in their Games.
Soon, she and Peeta are whisked away to the Capitol - a place of incredible wealth and heartbreaking cruelity. And while Katniss has sworn to come back to her sister, she really has to wonder, what will be left of her if she returns.
‚ÄúHere's some advice. Stay alive.‚Äù 
Honestly, this was the best apocalyptic YA teen novel I've read this year.

To be fair, this was one of the very first YA series I read, so every time I re-read it, I am just overwhelmed with nostalgia.

But, when I take off my rose-tinted glasses, I still think it's a pretty solid series.

The characters are really well-done.  

I love how Katniss's motivation is both pure and ruthlessness - and her personality isn't tainted with over-the-top self-sacrificing eyerollingly awful simpering mess that I see in quite a few of the newer YA series. 

Katniss's love for her sister humanized her otherwise stiff character. Her pride and will to survive energized the novel and kept me absolutely hooked. 

I appreciate that the smidge of romance  does not overpower the novel. Finally, a YA novel that plot doesn't solely hang on a love triangle - I love that it's more of a survivalist story. 

Overall, really pleased with this novel - cannot wait to reread the rest!

290,Guille,El guardi√°n entre el centeno,"Jun 03, 2022",5,"Ustedes conocen el s√≠ndrome de Stendhal, pues Holden Caulfield, narrador y protagonista de esta historia, bien podr√≠a perfectamente prestar su nombre a ese sentimiento de emoci√≥n extrema que √©l mismo experimenta ante un acto de verdadera bondad, m√°s si proviene de un ni√±o, pues no se puede dudar de la sincera bondad de un ni√±o bondadoso (Salinger subestima la mala baba de los ni√±os tanto como sobrevalora su felicidad). Un s√≠ndrome que tiene su cruz en el sentimiento contrario que experimenta al ser testigo de la hipocres√≠a, el fingimiento y la petulancia con la que act√∫an los adultos en su mundo insustancial y ego√≠sta.
 ‚ÄúMe paso el d√≠a imponi√©ndome l√≠mites que luego cruzo todo el tiempo.‚Äù 
Y entre esa ni√±ez y esa adultez anda Holden, expulsado nuevamente de un colegio, cabreado con su hermano mayor por haberse vendido al cine de Hollywood y abatido por la muerte de su hermano Allie, ‚Äúel muchacho m√°s simp√°tico, inteligente y entra√±able del mundo‚Äù. Tampoco es que est√© muy contento de s√≠ mismo, condici√≥n m√°s que suficiente para odiar a todos, aunque no soporte estar solo, y hasta para dudar de sus propias intenciones, por muy buenas que estas sean. 
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶ si de verdad te pones a defender a t√≠os inocentes, ¬øc√≥mo sabes que lo haces porque quieres salvarles la vida, o porque quieres que todos te consideren un abogado estupendo y te den palmaditas en la espalda y te feliciten los periodistas cuando acaba el juicio como pasa en toda esa imbecilidad de pel√≠culas? ¬øC√≥mo sabes t√∫ mismo que no te est√°s mintiendo? Eso es lo malo, que nunca llegas a saberlo.‚Äù 
Holden encarna como nadie al adolescente que no sabe qui√©n es ni d√≥nde encaja, que descubre un mundo, el de los adultos, que no le gusta y, lo que es peor, que no tiene soluci√≥n.
 ‚ÄúEso es lo malo. Que no hay forma de dar con un sitio tranquilo porque no existe. Cuando te crees que por fin lo has encontrado, te encuentras con que alguien ha escrito un joder en la pared‚Ä¶ aunque dedicara uno a eso un mill√≥n de a√±os, nunca ser√≠a capaz de borrar todos los joder del mundo. Ser√≠a imposible.‚Äù 
Holden es un Peter Pan que solo se siente a gusto entre ni√±os, encarnados en su hermana Phoebe, a cuya protecci√≥n frente a ese mundo horrible que est√° descubriendo dedicar√≠a su vida. 
 ‚Äú¬øSabes que me gustar√≠a ser? (‚Ä¶) Muchas veces me imagino que hay un mont√≥n de ni√±os jugando en un campo de centeno. Miles de ni√±os. Y est√°n solos. Quiero decir que no hay nadie mayor vigil√°ndolos. Solo yo. Estoy al borde de un precipicio y mi trabajo consiste en evitar que caigan por √©l. En cuanto empiezan a correr sin mirar ad√≥nde van, yo salgo de donde est√© y los cojo. Eso es lo que me gustar√≠a hacer todo el tiempo. Yo ser√≠a el guardi√°n entre el centeno‚Äù 
Holden puede ser muy dulce, divertido, considerado, pero tambi√©n un tocapelotas capaz de llamarte por tel√©fono a cualquier hora, de despertarte en mitad de la noche, de rondar incesantemente a tu alrededor como una mosca cojonera o, sin conocerte, de abordarte abusivamente con un desparpajo impropio de su edad. Es cobarde, mentiroso, bebe mucho, fuma m√°s, querr√≠a follar, no solo follar, no aguanta halagos, todo le suena a falso, todo y todos le deprimen, todo el mundo es hip√≥crita, todo le saca de quicio o le fastidia o le revienta, todos son cretinos que no saben apreciar lo bueno y que se vuelven locos por lo malo‚Ä¶ y al mismo tiempo, puede sentir una l√°stima insoportable por toda esa gente o echar de menos al m√°s cretino de sus amigos al poco de separarse de √©l.
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶hab√≠a como un mill√≥n de chicas esperando a su pareja: chicas con las piernas cruzadas, chicas con piernas preciosas, chicas con piernas horrorosas, chicas que parec√≠an estupendas, y chicas que deb√≠an ser unas brujas si de verdad se las llegaba a conocer bien. Era un bonito panorama, pero no s√© si me entender√°n lo que quiero decir. Aunque por otra parte era tambi√©n bastante deprimente porque uno no pod√≠a dejar de preguntarse qu√© ser√≠a de todas ellas. Me refiero a cuando salieran del colegio y la universidad. La mayor√≠a se casar√≠an con cretinos, tipos de esos que se pasan el d√≠a hablando de cu√°ntos kil√≥metros pueden sacarle a un litro de gasolina, tipos que se enfadan como ni√±os cuando pierden al golf o a alg√∫n juego tan est√∫pido como el ping-pong, tipos mala gente de verdad, tipos que en su vida han le√≠do un libro, tipos aburridos..."" 
El libro es divertido, tanto como tierno y conmovedor, su lenguaje es muy fresco, directo y sencillo demostrando que la claridad de la prosa no est√° re√±ida con la complejidad de lo expuesto. Todos (casi) podemos recordar sentimientos parecidos, experimentar el s√≠ndrome Caulfield en alg√∫n momento, reconocernos en las peripecias de este inolvidable Holden Caulfield, que, por ello mismo, desde su aparici√≥n es el gran arquetipo del adolescente atormentado."
291,David bernardy,Charlotte's Web,"Oct 08, 2007",5,"I grew up without reading this book. For some, that seems to be unimaginable. I can maybe understand why. My wife and I are reading it now, or I should say, I am reading it aloud before bed, and it's really wonderful. I could totally see why it would be a kind of life-formative book. I was reading a passage last night and laughing at it (there is so much in here that is really funny), and it made me wonder about the level of the humor. That is, would the kid me have thought this was funny or is it my adult self? And I think probably the kid would have. This is all to say that reading it now, as an adult, it gives me an appreciation for kids' minds, and kids' books that take them seriously, even in their humor. I hope that all makes sense. I'm a late comer to the Harry Potter books, too, but was really delighted by them in some of the same ways.

But--to get back to ""Charlotte's Web""--there's a section about the end of summer, a couple chapters away from their Fair trip. White makes this lovely kind of song about the end of the season and the coming of Fall and the kind of beauty and dread and tinged sadness of it all. My god, it was affecting. That's something that I probably would not have picked up on as a kid, but I think that has more to do with kid-me than with most kids. I know my wife remembered that part distinctly, in fact it is one of the reasons we went back to this book now. We have recently moved from Minnesota, our home for about four years, and Fair Time there just passed. We really experienced the sort of sad beauty of summer's end there. In our new place in Chapel Hill it hasn't happened quite yet. It is still hot and very dry from drought, so I don't know if there will be that kind of fading moment or not. We'll have to see.

Anyhow, when a book for kids (whatever--for all of us) can make you laugh and cry and think about the beautiful sadness of death--then, damn, what can you do but ramble?"
292,"Petra on hiatus, really unwell",The Princess Bride,"Sep 07, 2014",1,"I absolutely loved The Silent Gondoliers. It was just a perfect gem in every way, 5 stars was not enough reward for it's brilliance. With that in mind I was hyped to read The Princess Bride and not ready at all for the experience.

When I lived in Jerusalem I used to leave the snowy heights in winter for the perpetual summer of the Dead Sea, the lowest place on earth, about an hour away. Swimming was impossible, the water buoyed you up, rejected you even so that body parts were impossible to keep submerged. It was such fun, an amazing experience, something really special. After that I would run for the deep pools of fresh spring water to wash the salt off my skin. You jump in and sink to the bottom. It is a shock to the brain after the floating on the Dead Sea. You can't prepare yourself for the sinking, it is like an optical illusion, but a sensory one instead. And so it was with the Princess Bride.

For me, it just sank like a stone beneath the consciousness of the fun and perfection of the Silent Gondoliers. There you go. Maybe I will watch the film one day, I hear it is better."
293,Petrik,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Apr 27, 2018",4,"A short, important, and powerful classic that deserved all its fame.

This will be a short review, there‚Äôs nothing else I can talk about here that hasn‚Äôt been discussed for the past 50 years and more.

Racism, prejudice, rape, false accusation of rape, all of these are abhorrent and really should have never existed in the first place within our world and society. However, it does. I find it insanely sad that even though this book was published more than 50 years ago, has also been used as an educational book for countless young students and even with countless histories to learn from, it seems that some human will never ever learn from hem and the main problems depicted in this book is still very evident in our time.



‚ÄúYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.‚Äù



I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt understand how important the message this book tried to give when I was a kid; it bored the crap out of me and I didn‚Äôt make it to the exceptional court scene. Maybe same as the main character in this book, I didn‚Äôt truly understand the gravity of the situation yet when I was young. Now though? Let‚Äôs just say I realized why this book became one of the most highly famous and well-received classics.

One last thing, Atticus Finch is truly a role model to aspire to, as a father, a lawyer, and most of all, a human being; truly a well-written protagonist. 



‚ÄúThey're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.‚Äù



If it wasn‚Äôt for some part in the first half that bored me, this would‚Äôve received a 5 stars. But if we‚Äôre speaking about the message to be taken from this book? this was without a doubt an important and wonderful short read.



‚ÄúUntil I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.‚Äù



Amazing job on writing this book, Harper Lee. May you rest in peace.

294,Hippo dari Hongkong,Les Mis√©rables,"Dec 25, 2007",5,"One of the ""biggest"" book I've ever read, and I remembered Mick Foley's ""warning"" about a big book.

""A big book is like a serious relationship; it requires a commitment. Not only that, but there's no guarantee that you will enjoy it, or that it will have a happy ending. Kind of like going out with a girl, having to spend time every day with her - with absolutely no guarantee of nailing her in the end. No thanks.""

Haha... Well, I took my chances reading this big book. I made my commitment, I spent my time everyday with this book ( about a month ) and what do I get?
Happiness and the joy of reading!
This book really nailed me, I have my happy ending! Woo Hooo!
Thank you very much for the ""warning"" Mister Foley 

This book is amazing, lengthy in descriptions, compelling storyline and has influenced so many people. 
Breaks my heart into pieces but somehow put it back together.

295,Federico DN,Of Mice and Men,"Mar 23, 2019",3,"Sometimes people can do awful things, sometimes they mean it, and sometimes they don't.  

In this novel we learn the story of ""George"" and ""Lennie"". Two wandering day laborers traveling together; from work to work, from trouble to trouble. One small and cunning; the other giant, and retarded. Working from city to city, from field to field, but always protecting each other. A dream pushes them forward, work the fields until one day have enough to purchase a small farm of their own. A place where George can work the land, and Lennie tend the rabbits. But there are difficulties, Lennie in his brutish innocence tends to get himself into serious problems, and more often that not, both.

A short but very memorable read from the famed Pulitzer winner John Steinbeck. A little 100p novella about the unbreakable bonds of friendship, and the cruelties of a sometimes hostile rural world. 

**** One of those very few exceptions where the movie may actually match the book. John Steinbeck creates two immortal characters, but the movie (1992) gives them a real palpable soul. Mainly due to the exceptional performance of John Malkovich, and a very remarkable Gary Sinise. Brilliant book-to-film adaptation.

[1937] [103p] [Fiction] [3.5] [Recommendable] 
-----------------------------------------------

 A veces la gente puede hacer cosas terribles, a veces lo hacen a prop√≥sito, y a veces no.  

En esta novela conocemos la historia de ""George"" y ""Lennie"". Dos jornaleros errantes viajando juntos; de trabajo en trabajo, de problema en problema. Uno peque√±o y astuto, otro gigante y retardado. Trabajando de ciudad en ciudad, de campo en campo, pero siempre protegi√©ndose el uno al otro. Un sue√±o los motiva a seguir juntos, trabajar los campos hasta alg√∫n d√≠a tener lo suficiente para comprar una peque√±a parcela propia. Un lugar donde George pueda trabajar la tierra, y Lennie cuidar de los conejos. Pero existen dificultades, Lennie en su bruta inocencia tiende a meterse en serios aprietos... y m√°s que a menudo, a ambos.

Una lectura corta pero muy memorable del afamado ganador del Pulitzer John Steinbeck. Una peque√±a novella de 100p sobre los fuertes lazos de la amistad, y las crueldades en un mundo campestre a veces hostil.

*** Una de esas peque√±as excepciones donde la pel√≠cula tal vez supera la obra escrita. John Steinbeck crea dos personajes inmortales, pero la pel√≠cula (1992) les otorga un alma real. Principalmente gracias a las actuaci√≥n excepcional de John Malkovich, y un muy destacado Gary Sinise. Brillante adaptaci√≥n de cine.

296,Nancy,The Help,"Dec 01, 2010",5,"Posted at Shelf Inflicted 

One of my co-workers, a guy who isn‚Äôt much of a reader, borrowed The Help from the library based on his English professor‚Äôs recommendation. The guy just couldn‚Äôt stop talking about the story, so I decided to borrow the audio book. It‚Äôs not very often I get to discuss books with people in real life and I wasn‚Äôt going to let this opportunity slip by. Audio books are good for me. I was so engrossed in the story and characters that I drove the speed limit on the highway and took the scenic route while running errands. Sometimes I went out at lunch and needlessly drove in circles, or sat in the parking lot at work, waiting for a good place to stop. 

It is 1962 in Jackson, Mississippi. Twenty-two year-old Eugenia ‚ÄúSkeeter‚Äù Phelan has returned home after graduating college to find that Constantine, her family‚Äôs maid and the woman who raised her, has mysteriously disappeared. Aibileen is a black maid in her 50‚Äôs who works for the Leefolt family and cares deeply for their daughter, Mae Mobley. She is still grieving for her young son, who died in a workplace accident. Minny is Aibileen‚Äôs closest friend and a wonderful cook, but her mouth keeps getting her into trouble and no one wants to hire her, until Aibileen helps secure her a position with Celia Foote, a young woman who is new in town and unaware of Minny‚Äôs reputation. 

The story jumps back and forth between the three characters, all of them providing their version of life in the South, the dinner parties, the fund-raising events, the social and racial boundaries, family relationships, friendships, working relationships, poverty, hardship, violence, and fear. Skeeter‚Äôs mother wants her to find a nice man and get married, but she‚Äôs more interested in changing the world. Her plans to anonymously compile a candid collection of stories about the maids‚Äô jobs and the people they work for will risk her social standing in town, her friendships, and the lives of the maids who tell their stories. 

I loved this story! The characters really came alive for me, and the author did a good job acknowledging actual historical events which lent richness and authenticity to the story. I laughed and cried, felt despair and hope. This is an important story that is a painful reminder of past cruelty and injustice. It shows how far we have progressed and how much more we still have to accomplish."
297,"Fergus, Quondam Happy Face",Lord of the Flies,"Aug 31, 2020",5,"The year 1954 saw the first publication of Golding‚Äôs masterwork, the point of which had (independently) bifurcated my personality in that same year - in a series of ironic inner game-changing events...

Piggy and his upper-class schoolmates are marooned on a remote wild island. But left without adults, they quickly descend, like some of our leaders, into draconian martial violence - the powerful and strong versus the poor and weak (shades of Animal Farm?).

And I myself nearly became a Piggy.

January, 1954 saw the personal event that changed that transition forever.

You see, for 69 years I have lived my life in a perpetual rerun of Bill Murray‚Äôs Groundhog Day. And my moral values - though, praise God, not my Political ones - are so utterly and ironically shared with those of that McCarthyist year, 1954. 

I‚Äôm a Photographic Time Warp copy, in fact.

It all started on a crisp, clear January morning in 1954...

My colicky and irascible brother had come into the world ten months earlier - like me, he would have preferred to stay Close to my Mom forever, bless him. But - I had also around the time of his birth found my parents in an embarrassingly intimate act. I had been barely three.

And the day our car crashed on the Michigan Freeway when I was two was the origin...

That event had upset my psychological Apple Cart.

My Eden had vanished. And soon I was no longer the sole beneficiary of my parent's love. With the appearance of those twin sources of trauma, I became moody and withdrawn. And fell into entropy. Corporal punishment was administered, more and more frequently.

Yes, the Absurd split my life in two with those events - through no fault of. my parents - and a lifetime split resulted. Under that fractious stress, I retreated into the safe haven of Autism.

All because of my parents tried to love their children equally.

Kids can be so weird.

But by January 1954 my parents had seen enough of my inner ethical turmoil. They wanted to shore up my confidence. They bought me a popular 45 rpm record, whose flip side contained a ‚Äòfun‚Äô song about a ‚ÄúNumber One Son‚Äù who must be taught to not his ‚ÄúTroubles tell, for Life is to Enjoy.‚Äù

Their unsparing love had been replaced by an Ideological Life Hack, that I took for my own, just as a drowning man will hang for dear life onto a Brass Ring on a ship‚Äôs hold. A four-year-old needs a foundation for his values in the absence of primary love.

Yes, you guessed it: it was a substitute; an ideal false self. But thankfully, it made my Christian faith possible, and that endured.

But that Brass Ring, which gave me a traumatically Impossible ideal to live up to in order to be a Number One Son in their eyes, was psychologically destructive...

And its inner violent duality was at the heart of my psychological collapse in 1970 - it was the Perfect Storm: autistic, sheltered 1950's kid meets his violently postmodern climacteric - coming of age!

BUT - its mature, adult worldview was always ALL that stood against me - and the moral entropy and outright violence of a Piggy, towards whose personality I had been drifting by the age of four.

So WHAT if it turned me into a slightly funny lifetime Aspie and hence victim of all the symptoms of bipolar disorder?

My utter MORAL collapse was averted.

I maintained my values intact.

And for that, in my view, my parents and siblings deserve ALL THE CREDIT."
298,Jess,City of Bones ,"Jul 27, 2007",1,"Really, there's nothing very original, or satisfying in the book. She borrowed so heavily from Buffy, Harry Potter, and Star Wars that it sticks out like a sore thumb. It reads like altered fan fiction. And I love fan fiction, make no mistake, but it's not attempting to make a buck off someone else's world, either. Which is essentially what the book is. Cobbled fan fiction that has no cohesion.

I knew Clare as Cassandra Claire from Harry Potter fandom, I will admit, and that did color somewhat. But no matter the reputation, my review still stands. The blatant borrowing and cobbling jarred me from the story multiple times. As I said in another review, ""most likely would have still come to the same conclusions, due to the heavy-handed writing and knowing some of the more obvious media nods.

""For instance, the Silent Brothers kept reminding me of the Bringers in season seven of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer and the Dementors in Harry Potter mixed with a little bit of monks and made goodish. Yeah. Very hard to take them seriously. And people have repeatedly mentioned Sirius's flying motorcycle, which has been labeled a ""demon motorcycle."" That kinda reminded me of Anne Bishop's book Sebastian, which I put down to read City of Bones, because of the fact she has motorcycles that are run by demons, not for them. But still, it's obviously not something original, even though it plays a fairly important role in several scenes.""

I truly am glad I obtained the copy from the library and not purchased. I would have been irate over the 14 dollars that I would have lost. It did not inspire me to read the other two in the series. After all, I didn't spend money, so I would have been more willing to read the book. Now? Not a chance in Hades, even if it were frozen over with pink slushie."
299,Paul Eckert,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Apr 14, 2012",1,"I expected to really like this book. Its won several awards, and over the years I've always heard generally good things about it. 

So what happened?

Truthfully, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. To explain in broad strokes, I just never connected with the story. There seemed to be little, if any, internal logic to the events that happen. There is no reason why the children are burdened with such a delicate ""life or death"" task that they could easily screw up. There's no reason why they are ""helped"" until the very end, where they are suddenly supposed to be able to solve some hokey battle of wits to survive and rescue someone.

The characters are almost as unlikable as the thin plot. Meg, the oldest child, complains incessantly and is scared the whole time. Her little brother, Charles Wallace, is interesting because of his strange ability to feel what someone's thinking, but it's never explained why he is like this. He seems way too precocious for his age, even for someone with his ability. Calvin, the random kid thrown into the story for seemingly no reason at all, has zero personality and exists solely to hold Meg's hand every time she's scared (which is all the time) and to boost her fragile ego with a few compliments.

Like a lot of young adult fiction, A Wrinkle in Time falls into the trap of pitting an absolute ""good"" versus an absolute ""evil."" However, even this cosmic battle of good and evil is poorly defined. Examples of people who are fighting the ""good"" fight, according to the story, are Jesus, Buddah, and Gandhi. The ""bad"" is represented by a dark cloud and an extra-dimensional being called ""It"" who controls an entire planet of people like some 1950's cartoon version of a brainwashing socialistic dictatorship. I found it strange that the most evil thing that entire galaxies are fighting against does not desire chaos, power, or bloodshed, but a passive mind control through which its victims sacrifice individuality for equality. Wow, that's...so...evil? It's like reading Red Scare propaganda from the 1950's.

L'Engle kills the tone of this story by peppering the narrative with strange, out-of-place declarations of Christian belief. For a story that seems largely secular, the odd Bible quotes and religious one-sidedness felt out of place. In a world where an unseen God can murder all of humanity with a flood and wind up on the ""good"" list, while an egalitarian dictator who asserts its will without killing anyone is on the ""evil"" list, sign me up for the latter.

I could never get into this story. There were okay bits here and there, but nothing cohesive enough to matter. At least it was refreshing to read a YA book where the parents aren't dead. Most of the time it seems a kid can't have any fun in literature unless their parents have kicked the bucket. 


Maybe I would have enjoyed this book more as a child, but as an adult who has read a lot of fiction, this felt like it was slapped together without and real meaning or direction."
300,Trin,Twilight ,"Jun 19, 2007",1,"Let me give you an idea of how much my opinion of this book changed at different stages of reading. When I was about a third of the way through, I was so into it that I immediately put my name on the library reservations list for the sequel, and wishlisted every edition on BookMooch. Now, having finished, I doubt I'll bother to read any further in the series. The opening is really quite interesting: Bella moves from sunny Arizona to rainy, gloomy Washington State to live with her father (her somewhat loopy mom wants to follow her new husband while he's on the road as a minor league ballplayer). To her surprise, she gains almost instant popularity at her new high school‚Äîwith the exception of the beautiful Edward Cullen and his siblings, who either ignore her, or in the case of Edward himself, seem to be repulsed by her. Even though the reader probably knows going in that at least part of what's going on relates to Edward being a vampire (because it says in BIG LETTERS ON THE BACK that Edward is a vampire), it's still fun to speculate about what exactly is going on‚Äîwhy does Edward seem both drawn and repelled by Bella? Why does he save her life? What are a bunch of vampires doing impersonating students at a small town high school, anyway?

Unfortunately, the answers to all these questions seem to be either nonexistent or extremely lame. Edward reacts weirdly to Bella because she 1) smells unusually good, and 2) is the only person he's ever met whose mind he cannot read. No. 1 apparently makes him fall in love with her, while the reasons behind No. 2 are never explained. But, you know, the actual mysterious stuff is apparently not important‚Äîinstead it's more important that we realize that the Cullens are good vampires, who only eat animals, and who do nice, all-American things like play baseball in the woods. Okay! Also, all the weaknesses you've heard vampires have are just myths. Garlic, stakes, even sunlight‚Äîno problemo. Yet Edward would never even consider turning Bella, because that would make her an Evil Thing. Oh, and they also can't have sex, presumably because Meyer once read ""Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex"" (and/or is a Mormon. Sorry).

Instead, what Edward and Bella apparently CAN do is be very emo and teenage about their twu luv (despite Edward actually being over 100 years old), and be threatened by a villain that shows up in the novel's last third just to give it some semblance of an actual plot. Then, once all is well, they go to the prom! SERIOUSLY. THE BOOK ENDS WITH EDWARD TAKING BELLA TO THE PROM. What. The. Fuck.

And still, none of this answers my number one question: if you were a century-old vampire, why the HELL would you spend your time going to high school in Washington State? (Especially when you're not even trying to bang high school girls.) Angel at his most pathetic emo mopiness had more spine."
301,emma,The Great Gatsby,"Oct 11, 2022",5,"once upon a time, i had a very long, very passionate review of this book uploaded, with very long, very passionate pages of comments, and generally it was one of my favorite reviews (and of one of my favorite books) with one of my favorite ensuing discussions.

302,Fabian {Councillor},The Outsiders,"Dec 13, 2015",5,"Sometimes there are peculiar stories, stories which will not leave you for a long time and which are going to accompany you long after having turned the last page.

Sometimes there are touching stories, stories which feel so realistic that you believe every word the author puts into the novel.

Sometimes a book simply doesn't need perfect writing, beautiful language or consistent, flawless plotlines. The Outsiders is one of those books. It has flaws, not everything is believable. But there is something else it has: heartwarming emotions.

And sometimes a book needs nothing but to be full of emotions, and that's what moved me so much in this engaging tale which is, in its very essence, a love letter to humanity and friendship."
303,Manny,Romeo and Juliet,"Feb 19, 2009",5,"Every emo fourteen year old's dream. In bullet-point form:

‚Ä¢ fall in love with hot boy/girl (delete as appropriate) that parents can't stand; 

‚Ä¢ tender words and some sex - gotta find out what that's like; 

‚Ä¢ major tragic incident that really wasn't your fault, you were provoked; 

‚Ä¢ everyone's mad at you; 

‚Ä¢ die beautiful death in loved one's arms; 

‚Ä¢ parents finally understand how much they cared about you and are sorry they didn't treat you better when you were alive.

So how did Shakespeare manage to turn this heap of crap, which even Zac Efron would think twice about, into one of the most moving stories of all time? If you still need proof that he was a genius, look no further."
304,elissa,The Hunger Games ,"Apr 05, 2008",5,"I LOVE THIS BOOK! I've said to a few people that if I wasn't married, I'd have to marry this book. :) I read the 400 page ARC in a less-than-24-hour time period (so quickly that it was never even on my ""currently reading"" shelf), which I've only done before with HP books, and I've just officially put the first book on my 2008 favorites shelf. I feel pretty safe in saying that if this isn't still my favorite book of the year when next January rolls around, that I'll eat a hat. As soon as I finished reading it, I turned around and read it a 2nd time, which I've never done before in my life. I loved all of Collins' GREGOR books, and think she's a wonderful writer, but she's ratcheted it up to another level with this one. Even though it's the first in a trilogy, this one definitely stands alone, and I'm not sure how she can keep it up for another 2 books, but I suppose it's possible (think: THE GIVER, although I loved GATHERING BLUE, and liked THE MESSENGER--HUNGER GAMES is much more brutal than THE GIVER, though). It's got some very meaty issues to chew on, not the least of which is reality TV taken to extremes. There's a chaste and unresolved romance (think: TWILIGHT, but I don't think I will make it past the first in that series--HUNGER GAMES has much more action, more of a plot, lots of well-developed secondary characters, as well as extremely likeable main characters. I will miss Katniss until I can read about her again.). What more could you possibly ask for out of a book? It doesn't actually come out until October 2008, but if you can get your hands on an ARC, definitely do! I think that the violence in this will be easier for kids to take, since they probably won't see it quite as clearly as an adult will. None of it is particularly graphic, but it is definitely brutal. This is on the edge of too dark for me, which is my favorite kind of book. There aren't many writers who can push it right to the edge for me without going over (Zusak comes to mind immediately), but Collins is definitely one of them. Another book that I loved, and think of to compare this to is HOUSE OF THE SCORPION, but that fell apart slightly at the end for me. HUNGER GAMES didn't lack anything at all for me. OK, I'll stop gushing. I may have to re-write this review when I get some perspective. (2012: Obviously, I never did rewrite it, and this is my most-""liked"" review :) 

My 10 1/2 yr old son asked to read this with me, so I read it for the 3rd time with him in Oct 2008. Still my definite favorite book of the year, but all the typos in the finished book were pretty disappointing. Still, it's my choice for just about any award out there, come January, including the JHUNT. 

Update May 2009: I am dying because the CATCHING FIRE ARC has just been released, and people are saying it's at least as good at HG. I've had 2 teenaged boys at my library read this on my recommendation, and both of them came back asking me for more books like it (really there isn't anything). One of them has pre-ordered CATCHING FIRE on Amazon (updated to say that I worked in a fairly disadvantaged neighborhood in DC at the time, so that was not a usual occurrence). 

May-June 2011: I'm reading this for the 4th time, with my younger son, who's finishing up 5th grade. Still as good as ever!! Can't wait for the movie!!

Update 2012: Between them, HG and CATCHING FIRE were the pinnacle of my 20-yr career as a YA librarian! I've seen the movie twice so far, and definitely liked it better the 2nd time, when it didn't have to try to be my favorite book. :)

Update 2020: It's been 9 years since I last read this, but I've never listened to the audiobook, so I decided that having it read to me would be a good activity during the covid-19 pandemic. STILL as good as ever, and the odds will forever be in its favor."
305,Rick Riordan,City of Bones ,"Feb 19, 2014",4,"Okay, so I‚Äôm far behind the curve on reading this, but I very much enjoyed my introduction to the world of nephilim, Shadowhunters and demons. Clare constructed a vivid, believable parallel world with great characters, punchy dialogue, and a winning mix of humor, pathos and action. I like her take on warlocks, vampires, and werewolves, and of course I‚Äôm a big fan or urban fantasy, where these fantastic elements mix into the regular gritty city life of New York. Clary Fray is a sympathetic protagonist, though I was equally drawn to the supporting cast. I especially like that the villains are believably three-dimensional. Even when you do not support them, you understand what motivates them. There is no easy black and white, good and evil dichotomy. I‚Äôll be interested in seeing where the series goes from here, and what Clare does with her Victorian prequel series The Infernal Devices."
306,Sean Barrs,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Oct 07, 2021",2,"This started so well but then it got more and more boring with each chapter.

I was hooked on this as soon as I started reading. I found myself storming through it and totally invested in the story. Then somewhere, around half-way through, I found myself growing terribly bored. My reading rate slowed down. It started to feel like a chore, and it took me almost five months to finish it. 

What happened? 

The story seemed to stagnate, and the descriptions felt very similar and reused. Moreover, it didn‚Äôt seem to be going anywhere other than the obvious direction. Granted, it picked up towards the but by then I had lost interest and wanted the book to be over. It seems rather trite in a book review to complain about the length of a book, but I‚Äôm going to do it anyway: this felt too long. I have no problem with big books if they need to be big. This one felt padded out and like parts needed to be stripped back and the writing made tighter. It waffled on and I grew tired of it. 

It was slow, so painfully slow

I‚Äôm disappointed because I feel like I should have loved this one and I thought I was going to. I wish I had something more positive to say, but I can‚Äôt find anything else I enjoyed about it. It had a good hook but that‚Äôs it. Consider me very unimpressed.

Letting the story unfold without much caring about establishing complex magic or fantasy fraction constellations
Martin does what¬¥s the possibly hardest thing, writing suspenseful and credible characters, dialogues, and power struggles without wasting too much time with elves, dwarfs, or wizards, just some dragons, and ice zombies. His writing is so incredibly absorbing that I¬¥m close to saying that he¬¥s the best at blending characters with plot, but at the same time circumventing the problem of implementing too complex hard magic systems. That¬¥s kind of 

Unique to the genre
Most fantasy lives from showing how the magic characters deal with the pros and cons of their talents, abilities, and ethical dilemmas that come with throwing fireballs and mind controlling friends and foes. It¬¥s also possible that I simply still haven¬¥t read enough genre fiction, but from what I¬¥ve seen in the most first few volumes of series I tend to read before losing momentum and stopping the journey, no big one in the game dared to go full medieval warfare mode with just some grains of magic

Brutal, barbaric, and thereby totally realistic
This series is just badass as heck, Martin Chuck Norrises each atrocity thinkable throughout the series, and it starts wonderfully bloody, perverted, and disturbing. Definitely, a bit too extreme for some readers, especially because his writing is so realistic. 

Not just too much to handle for the audience, but the author too
I guess a reason for the time it takes to continue the series lies in the sheer complexity of this thing. In fan wikis and wikipedia one can see the number of protagonists exploding with each part of the series, which makes it impossible to read with big breaks in between the parts, and is even sometimes confusing while reading the series at once. Maybe it¬¥s not just laziness or the attempt to become a legendary master procrastinator, but simply the fact that Martin doesn¬¥t know how to handle the beast he unleashed. But it¬¥s the final consequence of 

Incredible characterization
Hardly ever reached in the genre. Just a total genius level how Martin creates such inner introspections and monologues, dialogues, and character evolution. It¬¥s a bit like with the Stephen King magic, one just can¬¥t understand how it¬¥s possible to be such a brilliant artist. There are long passages without much action, plot, or any other dynamic, just character evolving and struggling with life and there isn¬¥t a nanosecond of problems with suspension of disbelief or boredom. And it¬¥s also never bad to be a 

Total medieval nerd
Without that second, important ingredient, Martins¬¥ knowledge about and fascination for these disturbingly primitive and crazy times, he couldn¬¥t have come up with this worldbuilding. What good luck for readers that prodigy writing skills met nerdgasmic knight overkills.

309,Madeline,Brave New World,"Feb 07, 2010",5,"Aldous Huxley wrote Brave New World in 1932. That's almost eighty years ago, but the book reads like it could have been written yesterday. (especially interesting to me was how Huxley was able to predict the future of both genetic engineering and the action blockbuster. Damn.)

I think I liked this one better than 1984, the book traditionally considered to be this one's counterpart. Not really sure why this is, but it's probably because this one has a clearer outsider character (the Savage) who can view the world Huxley created through his separate perspective. 

In this light, I will give the last word to Neil Postman, who discussed the differences between Orwell and Huxley's views of the future: 

""What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. 
Orwell feared those who would deprive us information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. 
As Huxley remarked in 'Brave New World revisited,' the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny 'failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.' 
In 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' people are controlled by inflicting pain. In 'Brave New World' people are controlled by inflicting pleasure. 
In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us."""
310,Nilufer Ozmekik,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Mar 12, 2022",4,"Wow! I never imagine to read this book for the first time when I‚Äôm in my 40s. For years I let the book get lost in my chubby TBR that keeps growing at each day. Probably it stuck with piles of books and I wouldn‚Äôt remember to read it if Ted Lasso wouldn‚Äôt give this book to Roy Kent! If a book can heal one of the grumpiest fictional characters‚Äô soul, it may surely help me, too. At least that‚Äôs what I thought before I started.

 Overall: I loved the classic theme: three children‚Äôs teaming up for fighting against evil darkness threatening the universe. 

 I liked how 13 years old Meg portrayed and little, enigmatic brother Charles. As their fellow schoolmate Calvin joins them with the guidance of their weird neighbors with weirder names Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, Mrs. Witch, two children‚Äôs search for missing father turns into a visit to fifth dimension to confront with the universal threat!

 Yeap, I enjoyed it a lot and I‚Äôm so happy to skip the movie adaptations! I wish I read it sooner but better late than never! 

Here are my favorite quotes:

‚ÄúLife, with its rules, its obligations, and its freedoms, is like a sonnet: You're given the form, but you have to write the sonnet yourself. - Mrs. Whatsit‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can't take any credit for our talents. It's how we use them that counts.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe only way to cope with something deadly serious is to try to treat it a little lightly ‚Äú

‚ÄúA book, too, can be a star, ‚Äúexplosive material, capable of stirring up fresh life endlessly,‚Äù a living fire to lighten the darkness, leading out into the expanding universe.‚Äù"
311,Cecily,The Great Gatsby,"Aug 11, 2012",4,"I don't know if my appreciation of this should be tempered by the fact I was about three quarters of the way through before I realised I'd read it before (though I think it was many years ago)!

Plot

It is (mostly) set in Long Island in summer of 1922, amongst the young, idle, amoral rich, playing fast and loose with their own lives and indeed, those of others. All very glamorous, self-centred, and shallow, but the possibility of darker things lurking holds interest and tension. 

Characters

Even if you like celebrity parties, there are no good, pleasant characters; it may start off glamourising such lives, but things are very different by the end. 
‚ÄúThey were careless people... they smashed up things and creations and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness... and let other people clean up the mess they had made.""
Tragically, this even applies to children: only one is ever mentioned, she appears briefly, but is then oddly forgotten, perhaps reflecting that she is irrelevant to everyone, and to the story.

Nick, the narrator, is the odd one out in that he actually has to work for a living. Also, perhaps because he nurses a secret (view spoiler)[is he in love with Gatsby, or merely dazzled by him (hide spoiler)]? 


Image: Gatsby glamour and excess, from Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs 2013 film (Source)

Nick is also the most honest and honourable one (or perhaps the least dishonest and dishonourable, though the fact he explicitly mentions his reputation for honesty (more than once) does bring Lady Macbeth to mind). He reconnects with his cousin, Daisy, who is married to Tom, and dips his toe in their social set. Always the outsider, yet somehow inside, and thus surely culpable for things that happen, at least to some extent.

Daisy is perhaps the most significant character, though more words are written about others. Her name is unlikely to be a coincidence: daisies are robust and wild; they don't need or want hothouse pampering - despite appearances to the contrary. 

The host with the most is the mysterious Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties for people he barely knows (albeit with an ulterior motive). Like all the main characters, he is a westerner who moved east. Nick (and therefore Fitzgerald) seems to think this is significant, though as a Brit, it is somewhat lost on me. 

Artifice

Some people see through the artifice: 
‚ÄúShe was appalled by West Egg [the village], this unprecedented 'place' that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village - appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing.‚Äù


Image: Gatsby grime, from Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs 2013 film (Source)

Relevance today

Americans often have strong feelings about this book because of the way it explores (and, initially at least, admires) The American Dream. However, as a modern Brit, with no emotional attachment to the concept, it still feels relevant. 

The message is about the power - and danger - of chasing dreams, without giving thought to the wider ramifications. Extravagance and superficiality lose their lustre after a while. Perhaps the ""celebrities"" who currently fill the pages of glossy magazines such as Hello and OK should take note: there are many similarities. 

Or maybe it's about the overwhelming force of love - its costs and consequences - and the pain that hope bestows. Especially secret, forbidden love. 

Can you be true to yourself, or one you love, if you are dishonest in other realms?

Quotes

There are some wonderful descriptions and images:

* One such couple ""drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together"".
* At times, it is almost Wildean, ""I drove... to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all"" and ""I like large parties. they're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.""
* ""It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.""
* Chat that ""was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire"".
* ""The last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face... then the glow faded, each light deserting her with a lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.""
* ""Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.""
* ""trousers of a nebulous hue""
* ""the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor""
* ""Drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace... these reveries... were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing.""
* Regarding a college, ""dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny"".
* ""his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears""

There were also a couple of startlingly awkward phrases, one on the first page. No one is perfect, but given how much Fitzgerald is lauded for the perfection of his writing, they surprised me:

* ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.""
* ""A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in an informal gesture of farewell.""

Also, is ""the day... was pouring rain"" (not ""with rain"") common in American English?

313,Khurram,City of Bones ,"Jun 05, 2017",5,"A great and interesting book. I manage to combine the infulences from many of the top fictional series of our time. It combines the hidden magic world of Harry Potter, the teenage drama of Buffy, and a couple of themes from Star Wars as well. The book is very well written and fast paces.

We follow Clary Fray, a 15 year old misfit trying to find himself, not quite sure if she is goth, cyberpunk, or just a temperamental young artist. One night in the local club, Pandemonium, she realises she is a witness to an attack, the strange thing is that the victim of the attack disappeared right before her eyes, and when security arrives, despite the attackers standing right in front of them, she is the only one who can see them.

Clary descovers she is part of the world of Shadow Hunters and demons. Shadow Hunters are demon slayers. She learns stories of vampires, and Warewolves are more truth than fiction. She is attracted to Jace, the most accomplished of this group of hunters. Much to the chagrin of her best friend Simon and Jaces' hunter brother Alex.

She learns years ago that a charasamitic, powerful, and high-ranking Shadow Hunter, called Valentine, created his own circle to cleanse the world of all demonic blood. Whether they were good or bad, their existence was enough of a crime. He was ruthless to the point that he was willing to sacrifice anyone and anything human or demon as calateral damage. Now, after 17 years, Valentine has seemingly returned from the dead to finish what he started. Clary must learn of the ways of the shadow hunters if she is helping her friends stop Valentine.

Great story, good drama. The characters are ok. The only failing I found in the book were the fight scenes. I think these are not the writer's strongest area yet. All in all, it's a great book, not as action-packed as I expected, but the story makes up for this."

315,Justin,Fahrenheit 451,"Oct 01, 2009",5,"You can check out thousands of better reviews here and across the internet, but here is all you really need to know...

This is one of the best books ever written. This is one of my favorite books of all time. ALL TIME. This is the third time I've read it. I audiobooked it this time. 

Every line of Fahrenheit 451 is beautifully written. Poetic. Metaphoric. Transcendent. Awesome. The beginning, middle, and ending... all amazing. 

If you consider yourself a fan of science fiction or dystopian novels or classic literature or banned books or books high-schoolers read or thought-provoking books, and you have not read this book... wow... just stop whatever you are doing right now, which is reading this review, I guess...

Stop reading this review. Put down your laptop, your phone, your iPad, your mouse and keyboard, your floppy disk drive, your PlayStation 4, your Smart TV remote, whatever. Just stop. Grab your car keys, hop on a bus, walk... run to your nearest bookstore. Dash frantically through the aisles, locate the fiction section, maybe science fiction. Maybe just ask someone who works there. Find a copy of this book. It's written by Ray Bradbury, but my God, if you don't know that by now...

Demand a copy of this book from the bookstore, happily open up your purse or wallet and pay whatever price they make you pay for a copy of this book. Don't ask any questions. Don't have them put it in a bag for you. Don't get a copy of your receipt. Just hand over the money and get the hell out of there. Dump all of your spare change you've collected onto the counter. Tap into your 401k if you need to. 

Rush home and instantly sit down in your easy chair or whatever it is you like to sit, lay, or stand on while reading. The bathtub perhaps. A recliner. A porch swing. It really doesn't matter. Pour a glass of wine or grab a beer. Pour a glass of wine AND grab a beer. Take two shots of whiskey then pour a glass of wine and grab THREE beers. 

Then, in one sitting just plow the hell right through this book. Just breathe it all in like the cool, salty ocean air. Let it sink down deep into the depths of who you are as a person living as a human being in the world right here on Earth. Let it just smack you right in the mouth with how awesome it is. Let it punch you right in the jaw with how mind-blowing it is. Let it leave you lying on the floor with your mouth wide open trying to figure out what in God's name just happened to you. Let it elevate itself high above pretty much every other book you've ever read, maybe all the way to the top of that damned prestigious mountain, and let it hoist its flag into the soil of your mind and proclaim to every other book ever written that it is king of literature. Other books can bow down and bring burnt offerings to it. It shall reign forevermore. 

Don't wait to get it from the library. Don't even think about ordering it on Amazon, and I don't even give a damn if you have Prime and woohoo look at me I can get it shipped in two days. One day shipping if I pay a few bucks! No. Run. Get a physical copy of the book. Don't settle for reading text on your Kindle or whatever it is you digitize books into. Get up now. I don't care if it's late and the bookstore is closed. Go wait outside like it's Black Freaking Friday. I don't care if you're the only one out there all night. Are you a reader or not? Do you care about books? How have you not read this yet? What's the matter with you? Why are you still reading this? Why haven't you left yet? God...

I love Fahrenheit 451. And I love you enough to demand that you read it. Reread it. Yes! This is wonderful! This is going to be one of the best days of your life. Maybe the best day of your life! Are you ready? Can you handle it? 

Have fun."

Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully written novel about one of Japan's most famous geisha. I just wasn't sure I trusted the immersion into geisha life that the novel purports to represent. I enjoyed the read, but everything, all the dramatic tension from Sayuri becoming a geisha to auctioning off her virginity, fit way too nicely into a competition between Sayuri and her rival, Hatsumomo. It gave Memoirs of a Geisha a page-turning quality (and maybe that's just good writing), but here it struck me as a little false. I need to remind myself that it is fiction, but this prevents me from accepting the world of the novel. 3.5 stars"
317,Sean Barrs,A Game of Thrones ,"Jan 17, 2014",5,"2023 Review


I'd almost forgotten how much I love this book and series. After the television show ended so terribly, and after waiting sooooo long for the next book in the series, I'd begun to regard this series with mild contempt. So I knew it was time for another read to remind myself of the book that made me fall in love with reading so many years ago. 

I don't need to sell it to you. I don't need to tell about what this book does well or badly because it has received such cult status, instead I will simply say how much it affected my life. It was the first book that got me reading, really reading. That much so I changed my academic discipline and specialised in literature. I'm now writing my PhD and I knew if I'd never picked up  A Game of Thrones I'd have never made it down this path. 

Never underestimate the power of stories. Never underestimate how much reading can alter your life. 


Original Review (2015)

A Game of Thrones changed my life. I know that may sound sad, but it‚Äôs true. Prior to reading it I had no interest in books whatsoever. I was on course to be a forensic psychologist; however, I began reading this wonderful series. Suffice to say, it threw me of course ever so slightly: I am now studying a degree in English Literature. One day I'd like to teach it. 

 

A Game of Thrones kindled a fire within me that erupted into a love of books. I began to read other novels across the genres. It was slow at first, but I‚Äôd always come back to this series, which I read through its entirety at alarming speed, several times. I then went onto other fantasy novels and historical fiction, which distracted me from my degree work. I found myself reading Tolkien and Ken Follet when I should have been doing my degree prep. I then went onto classic authors such as Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson. Books became my life. 

 

I now spend countless hours reading literature of all varieties from Austen to Shakespeare, from Phillip Pullman to Sherlock Holmes. Reading for me provides a sense of escapism you just can‚Äôt achieve with other mediums because just for a moment you step into another world. Indeed, I find myself immersed in the plots, sympathising with characters and becoming engrossed in book after book. And to top it all I‚Äôm studying a degree where I get to read more wonderful authors I would never have discovered on my own. 

  

A Game of Thrones is not the best fantasy novel that has been written nor is it my all time favourite novel or series, but, it will always be something special to me because it was the first book that turned me into a reader; thus, I'll read it once a year, every year, to honour it.

Dear Peter Johnson üòÅüòÅ
(If you remember this particular line from the book, you know what I mean)


üñ§ 4 stars üñ§ for all that if-you-are-not-running-alongwith-Percy-Grover-Annabeth-while-you-are-reading-this-you-might-actually-die kind of reading!

Otherwise the first book in the series failed to impress me much regarding the characters or the plot development, or the ending. 

The big reveals or the surprises didn't do the trick. Yes, it may seem like I read a book which doesn't deserve that rating. But I say it deserves that rating still üëè

But yes, it is one interesting fast-paced read, too fast paced for my comfort ü§¶ that I had to put down the book for every fifteen minutes or so and remind myself to collect my thoughts or to just actually breathe normal. 

One thing keeps happening before another thing comes up. One character keeps happening before you try to grasp the character you have been just introduced to. Yep, I was low-key struggling at the beginning few chapters but dang, everything just gets along just like that. That's why I couldn't stop in between and had to just keep on reading.

Honestly, I didn't have too much expectations from the book or the series as it came out 15 years ago. But I knew I would like Riordan's writing. Yes, it worked like charm. 

But.

The first book felt like the second book or a sequel to a book that happened before. Don't get me wrong. I want better character introductions, character descriptions, better plot and character development and yasss, the so called villians to be more intimidating. 
For gods sakes, it's a gods' story! Mortals in contemporaries seem more intimidating to me.

I know it's a middle grade book and I give all the credits to the book that it deserves being so easy to get into and for being written in such an adventurous, fun, fast-paced style (ah, the gods seeming more us mortals than the actual mortals üòÅ) and for being still interesting to read considering it was written more than 15 years ago. 

I wanted more emotions when the story demanded it but it was like the author was telling me ü§¶ No! Stop right there! You are not supposed to feel sad! 
No! You cannot cry while reading this book!
No! You cannot smile or feel cute and warm and fuzzy inside! 

Yes, there were many scenarios where I was ready to feel more because.... the issue with Percy's mother. And more so when Percy gets to meet ...(ok. Stop. No spoilers.)

But I wanted to feel so much more because those moments right there demanded my emotions and feelings. But no. The author had to zip it and rush on to the next scene üò≠

I do not like anything that much about everything in this book.

It's just that everything worked on its own for a fun, fast easy read.

I hope I get to get more invested from the second book onwards. 

I really want to love this series. More than I do now. 

4 more books. 

10 more books after that.

321,Jon,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Jun 29, 2007",5,"In my experience, readers either love Adams' books or quickly put them down. I, for example, quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page, and have read the Hitchhiker's Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized. But both my wife and father couldn't get past book one: the former because she found it too silly, and the latter because he found the writing to be more about ""the author's personality"" than plot and character. 

Whatever.

The first three books in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, the Universe and Everything--are inspired lunacy. The ideas, plots, puns, jokes, and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers, but people from all fields. For instance: the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one; you can find dozens of recipes online for Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters; the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in 1989 was named after a computer in book one; and seriously, who hasn't heard that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42? (For more of these, consult wikipedia.org's entry on ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References"".) Chances are, if you're reading these books for the first time, you'll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams' creations.

The books aren't, of course, without their problems. Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had, and I paraphrase, a long beginning, a long conclusion, and not much in the middle (though I can't remember where I read that). He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out one-liners. The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines, and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics. 

Despite this, the Hitchhiker's Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books I've ever read--a position they've occupied for some fifteen years. Adams' wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness, and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly, consistently make me howl with laughter (the other being Terry Pratchett). Readers beware: if the Adams bug infects you, you will have it for life. And you'll never be sorry you let it bite."
322,Adina,Lord of the Flies,"Jan 18, 2021",3,"Edit: A friend send me this article of a real situation where a group of kids were left stranded on an island for 15 months. Spoiler alert, the Lord of The Flies scenario never happened, the boys behaved and organized themselves wonderfully

.Maybe,‚Äù he said hesitantly, ‚Äúmaybe there is a beast.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I mean is . . . maybe it‚Äôs only us.‚Äù.

That quote sums up very well the idea of this modern classic. I ran away from this novel for years but it finally caught up with me or I tripped, who knows? It was a lot more interesting than I expected and it was worth my time but I would not say I loved it. 

During some sort of war, a plane crashes on an island and the only survivors are a bunch of kids. Forced to stay alive without the guidance and surveillance of adults some start to behave crazy and cruel. I guess the morale is that people are civilized because there are rules that are reinforced and if the society gets rid of them some of use will return to our animal state or worse. 

While I admit that the story is thought-provoking and a classic, a pioneer of the subject, I cannot say I enjoyed reading it too much. Not much happens for most of the book and when it does it feels rushed. Also, the author spent a lot more time describing the nature than the characters or their experience. I had problems distinguishing between the children and I did not manage to form a strong opinion either about the positive characters or the negative ones. Finally, I think it did not age well, it is hard to explain why I have this impression. 

I both listened to and read Lord of The Flies. While listening I got lost in the descriptions (read bored) so I thought the written version was more suitable for this story."

The Written Review


Now we've entered the start of the not-so-happy arc. I don't even want to think about the ending. I would much prefer to reread the first four books again than suffer (vicariously) through that ending with Harry.

The twins antics keeps the book from becoming too depressing and Professor Umbridge is simply divine as the Big Bad. 

On a side note, ever think J K Rowling just wants to give sage advice to her kids and wrote an entire book to cover that up?
Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.

Youth can not know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.

We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.

328,Riju Ganguly,The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Apr 16, 2012",5,"This is not the first edition of this book that I had read. I had LOTR & The Hobbit long-back, in different editions, at different stages of mind. Before the movies had been released, LOTR/H used to be our own secret garden where we could have escaped any time we liked, but now oue own images have been replaced or landscaped by Peter Jackson. Nevertheless, if you think that G.R.R. martin is the last word in terms of writing fantastically entertaining fantasy, then read this book, and change your opinion, for ever. Highly recommended (esp. this version, since it brings together everything in a rather convenient and yet pleasant manner)."
329,Natalie Monroe,Charlotte's Web,"Feb 20, 2012",5,"How I feel about spiders when I read Charlotte's Web:





How I feel about spiders when I see one in my house:



But I really do love this book. Charlotte A. Cavatica, you will live on my heart forever."
330,Stephen,The Great Gatsby,"May 02, 2010",5,"Casual, self-absorbed decadence, the evaporation of social grace, money calling all the shots and memories of the past holding people hostage from the future that lies before them. Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald has nailed it and written one of THE great American novels. 

This book was a surprise. I LOVED it and all of the deep contradictions swimming around its heart. At once a scathing indictment on the erosion of the American Dream, but also a bittersweet love letter to the unfailing optimism of the American people. Call it dignified futility‚Ä¶obstinate hopefulness. Whatever you call it, this novel is shiny and gorgeous, written with a sort of breezy pretension that seems to mirror the loose morality of the story. Rarely have I come across a book whose style so perfectly enhances its subject matter. 

Set in the eastern United States just after World War I, Fitzgerald shows us an America that has lost its moral compass. This fall from grace is demonstrated through the lives of a handful of cynical ‚Äúwell-to-dos‚Äù living lavish but meaningless lives that focus on nothing but the pursuit of their own pleasures and whims. 

Standing apart from these happenings (while still being part of them) is our narrator, Nick Carraway. As the one honest and decent person in the story, Nick stands in stark contrast to the other characters. ‚ÄúEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.‚Äù Nick relays the story of the summer he spent in Long Island‚Äôs West Egg in a small house sandwiched between the much larger mansions of the area. His time in Long Island is spent with a group that includes his second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her rich husband Tom who live in Long Island‚Äôs East Egg. At one point in the story, Nick provides the following description of the pair which I do not think can be improved upon: 
They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.
 In addition, we have Jordan Baker who is a poster child for the pretty, amoral, self-centered rich girl whose view of the world is jaded and unsentimental. Basically, she‚Äôs a bitch.

The most intriguing character by far is Jay Gatsby himself, both for who he is and for how Fitzgerald develops him through the course of the narrative. When we are first introduced to Gatsby, he comes across as a polite, gracious, well-mannered gentleman with a magnetic personality who our narrator takes to immediately. 
He had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself. 
 However, from that very first encounter, Fitzgerald slowly chips away at the persona and peels back the layers of the ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù Gatsby until we are left with a flawed and deeply tragic figure that in my opinion ranks among the most memorable in all of classic literature. Nick‚Äôs journey in his relationship with Gatsby mirrors our own. ‚ÄúIt is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.‚Äù

Through a series of parties, affairs, beatings, drunken escapades, the lives of the characters intermesh with terrible consequences. I don‚Äôt want to give away major parts of the story as I think they are best experienced for the first time fresh, but at the heart of Fitzgerald‚Äôs morality tale is a tragic love that for me rivaled the emotional devastation I felt at the doomed relationship of Heathcliff and Catherine in Wuthering Heights. In general, Fitzgerald‚Äôs world of excessive jubilance and debauchery is a mask that the characters wear to avoid the quiet torments that haunt them whenever they are forced to take stock of their actions. Rather than do this, they simply keep moving. ""I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life."" 

In the end, Fitzgerald manages the amazing feat of creating a sad, bleak portrait of America while maintaining a sense of restrained optimism in the future. Both heart-wrenching and strangely comforting at the same time. I guess in the end, this was a book that made me feel a lot and that is all I can ever ask. I‚Äôm going to wrap this up with my second favorite quote from the book (my favorite being the one at the very beginning of the review): 
 And as I sat there, brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out Daisy's light at the end of his dock. He had come such a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close he could hardly fail to grasp it. But what he did not know was that it was already behind him, somewhere in the vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.
 5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!"
331,Ines,Charlotte's Web,"Dec 13, 2022",5,"May I say that this book is one of the most tender and cute my daughter and I ever read.
Yes, she is 10 years old and we still love to read together just before bedtime.
We really appreciated this precious friendship between Charlotte and Philbert the pig as the way they respect each other and got joyful for the small little events and things they encountered during the days....
Charlotte way of being a mom, friend and then a guide to Philbert was really lovely and emotional.
The legacy Charlotte's will leave to her friend pig are new lives to protect at any cost in order to protect Charlotte's legacy and memory. 
too. We really loved the description of the farm's life and how all the other animals interact between each others."
332,Angela M,Little Women,"Dec 20, 2019",4,"This classic that so many have loved over the years, many having read it as young girls, is somehow one that I never read until now. It‚Äôs a lovely story, and I wonder how I would have felt about it, had I read it when I was younger. Like so many readers, Jo, the lover of books, the writer, is my favorite, a woman before her time, exhibiting independence and a desire for more in her life. It‚Äôs a coming of age story in so many ways as we see Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy develop over the years, each realizing their flaws and wanting to be better as they become women. They are guided by their mother, Marmee, who raises them alone for a a while during hard times while her husband is off doing his part in the Civil War. Had I read this years ago, I‚Äôm not sure I would have been as perceptive to the other things this story depicts - the societal norms of the time and the time itself, during and after the Civil War. Overall, even though it felt a bit old fashioned given when it was written and the time frame it covers, there are universal and timeless messages about the bonds of family, morality and love. It was an uplifting story that I‚Äôm glad I finally got to. I‚Äôm looking forward to the upcoming movie. I just couldn‚Äôt see it without having read the book."

334,Emily (Books with Emily Fox),Wuthering Heights,"Feb 11, 2020",3,"A classic revenge story with two characters with bad temperaments...

I'm not sure how I feel about this book. It's dark, it's pretty messed up and definitely not romantic (really people? I worry about you)."
335,Sr3yas,Charlotte's Web,"Aug 02, 2017",4,"'I don't deserve it. I've never done anything for you.'
 'You have been my friend,' replied Charlotte. 'That in itself is a tremendous thing.‚Äù 


Wilbur is some pig who is Radiant and humble. On the top of that, he could do a mean back flip like the Karate Kid.



But would you believe me if I said that this radiant pig was almost killed..... twice? This is Wilbur's remarkable journey from almost being bacon to a beacon in the community! But this is not just his Journey. It's about Fern, the little girl who saved Wilbur's life when he was just a runt, and it's about Charlotte, a smart and sweet spider who befriends Wilbur.

And Charlotte can spell! It's like she has eaten a spelling bee! *wink wink*

It's a great Children's book. If I were a kid, I would've loved it even more. And as an adult, (well, an almost adult) I loved the descriptions on summer (It was almost as if I could feel my childhood!) and Charlotte's protective instincts towards Wilbur. I was not quite sure about parts focusing on Fern. They seemed a bit off towards the end. 

Oddly enough, Charlotte also reminded me of the characters from Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race. Well, food for thought.

In the end, Charlotte's Web is a story about kindness and love. It's about reaffirming faith in a person's personality and values rather than appearances. And above all, It's about the value of friendship. 

TL:DR?"
336,Rolls,Pride and Prejudice,"Mar 07, 2007",4,"""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen started off annoying me and ended up enchanting me. Up until about page one hundred I found this book vexing, frivolous and down right tedious. I now count myself as a convert to the Austen cult. 

I must confess I have been known to express an antipathy for anything written or set before 1900. I just cannot get down with corsets, outdoor plumbing and buggy rides. Whenever someone dips a quill into an inkwell my eyes glaze over. This is a shortcoming I readily own up to but have no desire to correct. So I admit to not starting this book with the highest of hopes. I did really enjoy Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"" however and so when my friend threw the gauntlet down I dutifully picked it up.

Boy did I hate him at first. To get anywhere with this book one has to immerse oneself in the realities of life and marriage in the nineteenth century. At first all this talk of entailment and manners just left me cold. I liked the language to be sure. Austen's dialogue is delightful through out but dialogue alone (no matter how delicious) does not a great novel make.

A hundred pages or so in though I started to see what a shrewd eye for character this Austen woman had. Mr. Collins was the first person I marvelled at. His character springs forth fully formed as a total but somehow loveable ass. From that point on I found much to love about this book. I was so into it by the end that I was laughing at some characters, sympathizing with others and clucking my tongue at an unhappy few. In short I was completely absorbed. 

In conclusion I must now count myself a fan of Miss Austen's novels (and not just their fim adaptations) and do so look forward to acqauinting myself with more of her work in the future. ""Emma"" anyone?"
337,Alex,The Great Gatsby,"Dec 24, 2007",5,"** spoiler alert **
           The Great Gatsby is your neighbor you're best friends with until you find out he's a drug dealer. It charms you with some of the most elegant English prose ever published, making it difficult to discuss the novel without the urge to stammer awestruck about its beauty. It would be evidence enough to argue that F. Scott Fitzgerald was superhuman, if it wasn't for the fact that we know he also wrote This Side of Paradise.

But despite its magic, the rhetoric is just that, and it is a cruel facade. Behind the stunning glitter lies a story with all the discontent and intensity of the early Metallica albums. At its heart, The Great Gatsby throws the very nature of our desires into a harsh, shocking light. There may never be a character who so epitomizes tragically misplaced devotion as Jay Gatsby, and Daisy, his devotee, plays her part with perfect, innocent malevolence. Gatsby's competition, Tom Buchanan, stands aside watching, taunting and provoking with piercing vocal jabs and the constant boast of his enviable physique. The three jostle for position in an epic love triangle that lays waste to countless innocent victims, as well as both Eggs of Long Island. Every jab, hook, and uppercut is relayed by the instantly likable narrator Nick Carraway, seemingly the only voice of reason amongst all the chaos. But when those boats are finally borne back ceaselessly by the current, no one is left afloat. It is an ethical massacre, and Fitzgerald spares no lives; there is perhaps not a single character of any significance worthy even of a Sportsmanship Award from the Boys and Girls Club.

In a word, The Great Gatsby is about deception; Fitzgerald tints our glasses rosy with gorgeous prose and a narrator you want so much to trust, but leaves the lenses just translucent enough for us to see that Gatsby is getting the same treatment. And if Gatsby represents the truth of the American Dream, it means trouble for us all. Consider it the most pleasant insult you'll ever receive."

339,jessica,Romeo and Juliet,"Jun 12, 2012",5,"‚Äòin fair verona, where we lay our scene..‚Äô


i went to verona this past weekend and there is a very special experience that comes from reading a story in the same place where it is set. the city has a very romantic feel to it, but its a gentle and quiet romance. which is completely different from the urgent and desperate love between romeo and juliet. 

we could argue for days about whether or not romeo and juliet were actually in love with each other (let alone old enough to know what love is) but, for me, my focus isnt the story. its how its told. the writing in this is so lovely (even when tybalt gets called a saucy boy lololol). i think shakespeare is a genius and the way his characters express love and longing and desire in this is really something else.
 

‚Äòcome, gentle night; come, loving, black-browed night;
	give me my romeo; and, when i shall die,
	take him and cut him out in little stars,
	and he will make the face of heaven so fine
	that all the world will be in love with night.‚Äô

maybe i just fell under the spell of city, or maybe shakespeares words really do have a profound effect on the reader, but i enjoyed this play and these star-crossed lovers. and its true what the prince says, ‚Äòfor never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo.‚Äô

341,Sophia.,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Nov 22, 2011",2,"So.. Memoirs of a Geisha. I'd been wanting to read that one for a very long time. I had heard so many good things about it. It's supposed to be awesome, and deep, and beautiful, right? 
Wrong. It's not. 

The writing was what bothered me the most. It's pretentious and superficial, and sloooooww and it goes on and on and on and on and on and still, very little happens. In some sort of weird combination, the writing is both superficial and clich√©. It feels like Golden thought it would be a good idea to emphasize all the Japan-and-nature clich√©s to the point of ridiculousness : I still can't believe how many times he compares something to the nature. Ironically, it doesn't feel natural at all. It feels forced and weird and and it's very annoying, as it slows down the pacing (which is already very slow) and frequently interrupts the narrator's flow of thoughts. 
 
Examples? Yes, yes. Because I was so sick and tired of reading for the 40th time how something is LIKE a bird or a snake or whatever, I made a list. Enjoy, people. 

This is how Sayuri narrates the story. Please notice and enjoy how natural this way of thinking sounds : 

""I felt as a dam must feel when it's holding back an entire river.""

""I felt as sore as a rock must feel when the waterfall has pounded on it all day long.""

""My poor scalp felt the way clay must feel after the potter has scored it with a sharp stick.""

And it goes on : 

""Like water bugs kicking along the surface.""

""Like the crisp skin of a grilled fish.""

""Like a scrap of paper in the wind.""

""Like ruts in the bark of a tree.""

And on : 
""Like a pig trying to survive in a slaughterhouse.""

""Like a stray cat on the street without a master to feed it.""

""My mind on the eve of my debut was like a garden in which the flowers have only begun to poke their faces up through the soil.""

""It was like when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly.""

""Out of my element as a pigeon in a nest of falcons.""

""Felt as a simple smelt must feel when a silver salmon glides by.""

Still not enough? I was hoping you'd say that. Here you go!(view spoiler)[ :
 ""Like what a workman does to a field using a hoe felt the way clay must feel after the potter has scored it with a sharp stick.""

""I felt as the waves of the ocean must feel when clouds have blocked the warmth of the sun.""

""As if he were the wind that blew and I were just a cloud carried upon it.""

""Like a tree and its roots, or like a shrine and the gate that stands before it.""

""With as much difficulty as a hungry child turns away from a plate of food.""

""I felt like a slab of tuna the grocer had just delivered.""

""I was like a temple bell that resonates long after it has been struck.""

""I tried to imagine I was simply a house standing in the rain with the water washing down the front of me.""

""Like when a stone is dropped into a pond, the water continues quivering even after the stone has sunk to the bottom.""

""Like the tree where the tiger might sharpen its claws.""

""Like a fish belly-up on the stream.""

""A tree may look as beautiful as ever; but when you notice the insects infesting it, and the tips of the branches that are brown from disease, even the trunk seems to lose some of its magnificence.""

""As much a part of her as a song is part of a bird.""

""Was as simple as a stone falling toward the ground.""

""If you no longer have leaves, or bark, or roots, can you go on calling yourself a tree?""

""Felt toward him just as an ice pick feels toward a block of ice.""

""The two of them weren't ""spending time together"" any more than a squirrel is spending time with the insects that live in the same tree.""

""Like the fisherman who hour after hour scoops out fish with his net.""

""Like a mouse expecting sympathy from the snake.""

""Like rice pouring from a torn sack.""

""Expanding just like a river whose waters have begun to swell.""

""I was like a child tiptoeing along a precipice overlooking the sea. And yet somehow I hadn't imagined a great wave might come and strike me there, and wash everything away.""

""Like a snake that had spotted a mouse.""

""Your eyes hang all over him like fur on a dog.""

""I began to feel like a tree whose roots had at last broken into the rich, wet soil deep beneath the surface.""

""Just as naturally as the leaves fall from the trees.""

""Just as a stone must fall toward the earth.""

""It was all like a stream that falls over rocky cliffs before it can reach the ocean.""

""No more permanent than a wave rising on the ocean.""

""Just like watery ink on paper.""  (hide spoiler)]

So yeah. Just because of that, it can't get more than 2 stars for me. It just can't. It's awful to read. 

And the characters. *SIGH* What can I say about them? Hatsumomo was just a big clich√©, and so was Pumpkin, and so was The Chairman. 

They didn't feel real. None of them did. Sayuri on top. So I'm supposed to feel something for her, right? Relate to her somehow. That was impossible. I don't know why, but somehow I was able to relate to Chiyo - but not to Sayuri. Even though they're the same person, I couldn't bring myself to care for Sayuri. As soon as she ""grows up"" (even though she keeps telling her story with the skills of a freakin' 4 year old) so around the time when she becomes a geisha, that is, she becomes insufferable.
 
And she has this sort of weird fascination for adult men, first M. Tanaka and after The Chairman, and it's just so annoying. Why does she like them? Why? 

And, yeah, she was also such a victim. She never made anything to change her condition, she was just this kind of submissive woman who, well, blinks and, I dunno, bows. I know it's the way she's supposed to behave, but still, it's infuriatingly boring to read about such a character. The only thing she ever does for herself is (view spoiler)[ sleeping with The Minister so she doesn't have to undergo Nabu-whathisname as a danna (hide spoiler)] but even that is done in the purpose of eventually being with The Chairman. And who was he, that Chairman? Who was that man we hear about, again and again and again? What's he like? Have they ever had a real conversation? I don't think so. She idealizes him, she never sees him as who he really is, she just keeps wetting holding that stupid handkerchief every night and that annoyed me. It felt childish and weird. 

The only character I liked was Mameha, and she's the angel of the story, meaning that you're just supposed to like her because she's, well, perfect, kind, loyal and beautiful, the way Agnes is in David Copperfield or Melanie in Gone With The Wind.

The informations about Geishas were nice, I suppose, but I don't know how much of it is true. The war was awfully, awfully boring, and very badly executed. 

I think you can see it was written by an American just by the way the United States are depicted. They atomically bombarded Japan and two of greatest its cities and yet, Sayuri doesn't even blink and say ""The American troups were very kind to us and gave candy to the children."" Er... Really?

The plot dragged on and on, and I had to struggle to finish the book. The ending felt rushed. I hate, hate it when authors do that. He wrote a whole book about someone's life, and the final chapter is soo rushed and it goes like ""So that was forty years ago, now I'm seventy and I'm old and I'm gonna tell you what happened in my life between then and now in like, two sentences. So I married the guy I talked so much about, and then we went to live in the USA because that's like ZOMG the best country EVAR! And then he died, and.. Ah yes.. Did we have a kid? Oh, but wouldn't you like to know!.. Well you won't, cause I'm not telling you, neener- neener. Whatever I'm old, and I'm probably gonna die now LIKE A BIRD THAT FLIES AWAY"", because what would be the final sentence without a nature-related comparaison, huh? Right. I swear, the book probably deserves an award, for like Worst Ending Chapter Ever or something. It made no sense, it gave no real closure.

Everything in this book was just so... flat. It tried to be epic and it tried to be a classic but it failed so badly. The characters weren't well fleshed-out, it was obvious that the Good people (Sayuri, Mahema) would triumph over the Bad (Hatsumomo), it was obvious that Sayuri would get her happy ending after all.. 

See, all throughout the book, I was completely disconnected, I didn't feel anything. I didn't smile, or laugh, I certainly didn't cry. I can't even say I'm angry or that I hate the book - because hatred requires that I care, and I don't. I'm just... indifferent. Bored. Unimpressed. And isn't it the worst state of mind you can possibly be in after you finish a book? Ultimately, it didn't leave a mark. 

So the book as a whole was a major disappointment and I'm glad it's over. I just hope the movie might be better - I kept thinking it would be better to watch it, seeing how graphic the descriptions were (of the kimonos, for example). [Edit: So I saw the movie. Meeeh.]

But as a book, it was unconvincing and very flawed."
342,Stephen,The Catcher in the Rye,"Mar 18, 2010",5,"5.0 stars. I LOVE IT when I go into a book with low expectations and it ends up knocking me on my ass. Admittedly, this is tougher to do with ""classics"" but it certainly happened in this case. I remember first reading this in school (like many of us) and not thinking it was anything special. However, having first read it almost 25 years ago, I knew I had to read it again before I could feel justified in actually reviewing it. Of course, I didn‚Äôt hold out much hope that my feelings would change and was expecting a fairly painful reading experiece. 

In fact, as I started reading, I was already thinking about what my amazingly insightful, completely ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it cool to bash on the classics‚Äù 1 star review was going to focus on. I thought maybe I could bag on the less than spectacular prose used by Salinger (making myself feel really smart in the process). Or maybe I could take some jabs at the less than exciting narrative pacing (and throw in a few references to ""watching paint dry""). 

In the end, I thought my most likely avenue for attacking reviewing this anthem of teen angst was that it was utterly yawn inspiringno longer relevant today because of the GLUT of teen angst that the recent generations have been exposed to ad nauseam growing up. I mean we live in a time in which teen angst is EVERYWHERE and even has its own sub-genre label now. You can find it in:

MUSIC.........

AND EVEN THE SHITTY POPULAR LITERATURE*** OF OUR TIMES...


 
*** Literature is a serious stretch, but I must admit that these books do IN FACT fill me with ANGST!!!

So what happened to all of the preconceived notions I had before I starting reading this book? 




Instead, I found myself completely drawn into the rich, nuanced story of Holden Caulfield. I found myself empathizing with Caulfield almost from the beginning (something I did not expect to do). His ""annoying"", ""pseudo rebellious"" and ""just don't care"" exterior were so obviously manufactured and so patently hiding a seriously sad and lost boy that I was transfixed on finding the real Holden Caulfield. 

Despite the book being written ""in Holden's own words"" the reader was still able to discern that Holden's surface response to a situation was hiding a much deeper, emotional resposne. For Salinger to be able to infuse that kind of nuance into the sparse prose of Caulfield‚Äôs narrative was nothing short of brilliant in my opinion. 

Caulfied is lazy. He is stubborn. He is immature. He is unfocused. He is untruthful. He is dangerously short-sighted and he is lost in his own world or unrealistic expectations. Sounds like that could certainly be a not unsubstantial portion of the male 16 year old population. 

However, after reading this book, I learned a few other things about Holden that I though were fascinating and that are not as often discussed:

1.	He is desperately lonely (he even goes so far as ask his cab drivers to join him for a drink);
2.	He is generous with his time and his things (he writes an essay for his roommate despite being upset with him and even lets him borrow his jacket); 
3.	He is extremely sensitive and longs for an emotional (rather than just a physical) commitment (he mentions several times his need to ‚Äúbe in love‚Äù in order to be physical and his experience with the prostitute certainly bears this out);
4.	He is intelligent (despite being lazy and unfocused, Holden displays great insight and intelligence regarding books he has read and displays at the museum); and 
5.	Despite being unable to process it correctly, he is full of compassion and has a deep capacity for love, which he shows most notably for his sister (this was one of the most powerful parts of the story for me as it was Holden‚Äôs desire to avoid hurting Phoebe that keeps him from running away at the end of the book). 
 
Taking all of the good and the bad together, I was left with the feeling that Holden is an adolescent on the cusp of adulthood who is achingly afraid of the loss of his childhood and the responsibility and commitment that he sees as required to make it in the ‚Äúadult‚Äù world. He is compassionate, intelligent and deeply emotional and yet is unable (or unwilling) to focus that energy on those steps that he sees as leading him away from his ‚Äúhappy memories of childhood‚Äù and closer to the ‚Äúscary world of the adult.‚Äù 

I think this is superbly shown in Holden's expressed dream of wanting to being the ‚ÄúCatcher in the Rye.‚Äù Quick side note: I had no idea what the title to the book referred to until I just read the book. Here is a person so afraid of growing up and so averse to giving into the pain and sadness that he sees as the result of becoming an adult that he wants nothing more than to spend his life protecting others from losing the innocence of childhood. Big, crazy, ‚ÄúI want to save the world‚Äù dreams are a wonderful part of childhood and it is a shame that such ideas and beliefs are too often destroyed under the barrage of ‚Äúyou really need to grow up‚Äù rather than having such dreams transitioned and re-focused into daring the improbable within the world of the possible. 

A great and moving reading experience and one that I give my HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!"
343,Henry Avila,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Jan 28, 2015",5,"Jose Arcadio Buendia decides one day in his small rather impoverished town, set in South America (Colombia, in the early 1800's ) that he wants to leave, say goodbye forever to the relatives, a killing makes him feel uncomfortable there, taking his pregnant wife Ursula his first cousin, and explore the mysterious lands beyond the unknown horizon with his followers and friends over the treacherous mountains through the dense , noisy jungles full of wild animals and sickness...months pass, they have not yet seen the sea their ultimate goal.

344,Lisa,Of Mice and Men,"Jun 25, 2014",5,"""Yet each man kills the thing he loves..."" 
 
Oscar Wilde's prison poem came to mind not only for its literal truth in the context of Lenny and George, but also because it evokes the brutal isolation of the whole cast of characters, each one of them stuck in their separate reality and unable to connect with each other. The young lonely wife has nobody to confide in, and keeps looking for trouble out of sheer isolation. The black man is so utterly alone that he is almost insane, and the barrier of his skin colour is even more impenetrable than the woman's gender. George's loneliness is connected to his responsibility for Lenny, and Lenny himself is in the brutal prison of his intellectual inferiority and herculean strength. Even the boss' son is in a no man's land between privilege and torture.

The dream of sharing a future together keeps the men's spirits alive for a while, and it is contagious. Breaking out of the isolation, enjoying freedom and partnership - those are powerful ideas.

""Yet each man kills the thing he loves...""

The domino effect of Lenny's inability to control his strength or his craving for softness and love makes all dreamers wake up to a nightmare without end. The only solace is finding another human being who understands enough of the pain of killing what one loves to offer a sign of support or friendship in the misery of reality.

Lenny broke my heart, and yet I had to smile at his limited vision over and over again. When I first read this novel, I was a busy teenager, bored and frustrated that school picked my reading materials for me, not willing to enter into the confused minds of men with whom I had seemingly nothing in common. With hindsight, I see myself in a cloud of ignorance, not fully grasping what happened around me, missing a masterpiece in the process - I was very much like Lenny myself, unaware of the bigger picture of what was going on around me. Reading Of Mice and Men now, to prepare a teaching unit for a new generation of fifteen-year-olds, I find myself more in the role of George, gently coaxing, carefully repeating the information I consider crucial, avoiding too much detail out of fear to completely lose the attention of my students. Lenny and George live a life of their own in my head now, and they have transcended their bitter story and become part of mine.

Just what one expects of a great classic!"

346,Ariel,The Illustrated Animal Farm,"Sep 21, 2015",5,"I first read this in Grade 11 and decided it was my favourite book. I knew a reread needed to happen right away, but it took me four years to finally get around to it when my boyfriend gifted me this beautiful illustrated edition. Animal Farm is a book I often think about and often quote, and it was a bit nerve-wracking to go back to it to see if it actually lived up to everything I had built it up to be. Thankfully, I'm thrilled to say it did.

In many ways it's a little bit underwhelming the second time around, because the plot (which lots of people will already know because it's a retelling of the Russian revolution) is extremely simplistic. This meant, however, that I was able to focus more on motivations and symbols and the other meaty stuff outside of the plot (which, don't get me wrong, was still hella exciting).

The big question: is this still my favourite book? Yes. I've not yet read a book that so succinctly and simply drives home an idea with wonderful intricacies and nuances. After all this time I also feel so comfortable with this book, I get it and love talking about it and see reflections of it all the time. Also, in response to this edition, I loved the illustrations. They were sinister and childlike and felt like political caricatures - I think Orwell would like them. Apparently Andy Serkis is going to be making a film adaptation of Animal Farm and I'm super jazzed. That doesn't really have anything to do with this review, but I wanted to share my joy.

Finally, thank you to Greg for gifting me this pretty book, reading it aloud with me over FaceTime, and letting me go on big rants about why Benjamin is the WORST. <3

One of my favourite classics. Absolutely brilliant. Just great. Read it in Grade 11 and never looked back! Really introduced me into loving classics."
347,emma,Little Women,"Jan 06, 2019",4,"I‚ÄôM IN LOVE, I‚ÄôM IN LOVE, AND I DON‚ÄôT CARE WHO KNOWS IT!

When I was a child, my mother used to drag me to antique stores all the time. There is nothing more boring to a kid than an antique store. It smelled like dust and old people, and everything looked the same (dark wood), and if we were in a particularly bauble-heavy shop I had to clasp my hands behind my back like a Von Trapp child in order to avoid invoking the you-break-it-you-buy-it policy on a $42 crystal ashtray.

On one such excursion, when I was like eight, I found a vintage-ish copy of Little Women. Because it was a book, and because it had some kind of illustration of pretty girls in pretty dresses, it was far and away the most interesting thing in there. So I indulged in what was then and what remains one of my favorite pastimes: asking my mother to buy me something. She said no, both because it was confusingly expensive and because she doubted eight-year-old me‚Äôs lasting interest in reading a 750-page book from 1868.

Ever since, Little Women has tantalized me.

I am very pleased to say it lived up to every expectation.

This book is so cozy and delightful and happy. A lot of the time, when series start out in the childhood of characters and then follow their growing up, the book gets worse. But I always liked reading about this ragtag group of gals!!

Warning, spoiler ahead, and if you complain about me spoiling a book that was published seven of my lifetime ago I will absolutely freak out so don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt give you a heads up:

Obviously Jo and Laurie were meant for each other, and his marrying Amy and Jo‚Äôs marrying some random old dude was the biggest flaw of this book. But even with that, this book ended happy, and I enjoyed almost every second of it.

(Okay, I‚Äôm sorry, but Amy is the clear weak link and didn‚Äôt deserve Laurie!! I will not rejoice for them!!) (Did I have to take off a half star for that alone? Yes. Because it upset me immensely. And I won‚Äôt apologize. If anyone should be apologized to, it‚Äôs ME. And also JO. And also LAURIE!)

But absolutely every other second was a pleasure.

Bottom line: This book feels like Christmas.

350,Sarah,Twilight ,"Feb 27, 2008",1,"** spoiler alert **
           Okay, I have to say that I picked this book up partly due to all the hype (and partly because it's involved two of my favorite genres)... I mean, so many people had recommended it to me and I finally got sick of hearing about it, so I picked it up and read it... or as least tried to.

Let me first say that I am a huge romance and vampire/supernatural fan, so when I first heard about the book I was really excited to read it because it combined two of my favorite genres.

But, I really regret ever buying and forcing myself to finish it (I hate not finishing books, even if I hate them), it was so bad. Though, let me tell you that I really wanted to like it, really I did... I'm one of those people who likes a lot of popular things, Twilight was popular, so I figured... I would love it just like everyone else, but I was very, very wrong. 

A lot of fans wonder why I hate the book so much and here is my list and it's a pretty long one, so get ready:

1. Lack of characterization:
Bella- Okay... I absolutely hated this girl. She was the worst female protagonist I have ever read about! She's stupid, shallow, selfish and just plain annoying! Not to mention she's pathetically dependent on Edward... I mean, come on, NO girl should be that dependent on a boy, not only is that pathetic, but it is very unhealthy. She was also a clumsy little damsel in distress who was dumb enough to get herself into situations that she couldn't get out of. I would have loved for Meyer to have given her a backbone, so she could have done something useful instead of whining and doing stupid, idiotic things that no remotely intelligent teenage girl would actually do. Not to mention the fact that she is apparently very ""plain"" looking... if that's the case then why are there several guys fawning over her? (And, according to Meyer, one of them is a teacher... um, ew). Bella is a Mary Sue, simple as that. And I hate Mary Sues.
Edward- Okay, this boy is just way too possessive and stalkerish (it is not romantic of him to sneak into Bella's room and watch her sleep! It's creepy and wrong!) Oh, and ""bad boys"" usually don't sit there and say ""I'm dangerous, stay away"" etc. all the time... I also hated the fact that Bella described some part of his body every other page. It was completely UNNECESSARY!! Okay, we get the fact that he's hot, Bella... now MOVE ON! 

I could go on and on about all the characters... every single one of them was a flat, cardboard cut-out that did not seem realistic at all.

2. Writing style:
Purple Prose- Ew... to this... seriously, all the purple prose made me want to throw the book across the room. Enough said. 

3. Descriptions:
I know I said up there that I got sick of reading about how gorgeous some part of Edward's body was every other paragraph... and if that wasn't bad enough... what's worse than is the fact that even with all that unnecessary description of him and everyone else (though mostly him, since Bella is that shallow) I still had a hard time picturing him or any of the characters in my head, for that matter. I also had a hard time picturing a lot of the setting and the action in my head as well. It's kind of sad really... there was so much description, you would think that everything (Edward especially) would be embedded into my brain, but no. That's what makes me wonder why so many fans find Edward so ""hot"", I never got a clear picture of him in my head to even begin to form an opinion about whether he was ""hot"" or not.

Seriously, Meyer completely abused the dictionary and the thesaurus while writing this book (so much so that I think she should never be allowed to look at either one ever again)... there are so many big descriptive words used that could be replaced by smaller words that look and sound better. Half the time the words that she does use doesn't really go with what she's trying to say. Simply put: Stephenie Meyer is a moron and doesn't know that when writing you are supposed to use the thesaurus sparingly (aka: only when it is truly needed and not any time you damn well please), it really ruins everything if it's used too much... as Meyer has perfectly portrayed with this atrocious book.

4. Plot:
Okay, the plot gets it's own category because it pissed me off so much. I mean, seriously... where was it?! It was nothing but sappy, gag worthy fluff between Edward and Bella until page 400 or so, when something finally happened. And, even then... it went by so fast and was not explained well at all (since Bella conveniently fainted during it, which is such a cop out). It seemed to me that Meyer just threw it in there, and it was only put there in the first place, so that she could point at it and say, ""Look, there's a plot right there."", when people like me came around and said otherwise. But that's not a plot!! The plot should not take 400 pages to start! And no the whole ""romance"" between Bella and Edward is not the plot! This is especially the case since we knew from the beginning... thanks to the moronic give away on the back cover that states that Bella and Edward were going to fall in love... speaking of that, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to give away the fact that Edward was a vampire on the back cover?! I mean... really?! That took away any suspense/mystery the book might have had for the reader about what he was... so, while Bella was stupidly wondering what he was, I was sitting there yelling at her for being such a moron and not seeing what was right in front of her.

5. Plot holes 
The one thing that drove me absolutely CRAZY was the the fact that no one in the small town of Forks noticed that the Cullens never aged! And the ""children"" never graduated and went on to college. I mean, if they've been there for more than four years, than I'm assuming that someone would have noticed! I mean, the town could not be full of that many morons! (Okay... I've been told several times that Cullens have only been living in Forks for about two years... I guess all the purple prose distracted me from reading and remembering that little detail...) Speaking of school, why in the world would they willingly choose to take high school over and over again? Especially since they all have several college degrees (which leads me to wonder why, since they are so ""human loving"" they can't do something useful with their education like Carlisle, instead of sitting on their butts all day and just being useless) I know they need to ""fit in"", but seriously.. . that's just stupid... they could always pretend that they're home schooled (it's not that uncommon these days). Since that's how the Cullens fit into society, that means they have to move every four or five years to avoid suspicion, right? Wow... that must really suck. However, they wouldn't have to do that if they didn't put the younger ones in school since if they were in the workforce (and being useful to society) then they could stay for a lot longer before people started wondering why they don't age. But, I think I know why Edward and his ""siblings"" tortured themselves day after day by going to high school... Stephenie Meyer wasn't creative enough to come up with any other way for Edward and Bella to meet. It would have made more sense for them to have been neighbors or something. I can come up with several nice ideas about how that would have turned out and it would have been much better.

I've been told that there are more, but those are the two that really bugged me. Though, I love the fans response to the mention of any plot hole (the rabid ones, not the sane ones, of course). It usually goes like this: ""Well it is a fictional vampire book."" That's a stupid reason. Just because it's a book with vampires doesn't mean it's exempt from having to be realistic and not having glaring plot holes.

I've also been told that there are even more in later books, but I'm not about to torture myself by reading the rest of the series just to find them and list them... I have better things to do with my time... like reading books that are actually good and not a waste of my time or money.

6. Vampires
Like I said before, I'm a big vampire fan. But, this book is an embarrassment to vampire fiction. The vampires are pathetic, sweet, innocent, almost ""misunderstood"" creatures. I know that Meyer has every right to create her own idea about vampires. And, to be honest, I was okay with her idea about vampires until they started sparkling. VAMPIRES DON'T SPARKLE! To have them sparkle takes away the evilness of the myth of the creatures (since, they are creatures of the devil...at least, originally, they were). Evil creatures do not sparkle, the idea's laughable at best. Most normal people are not scared of something that sparkles in the sun. I mean, I know if I saw someone sparkling; I would not immediately think ""vampire"" and run. Not only because I don't associate sparkling with vampires, but also because how the hell is sparkling evil or scary?! By the way, the whole sparkling vampire idea just seemed to be there because Meyer wanted a reason as to why the vampires could even walk around in the daylight to begin with. The idea was just a convenient way for her to write the vampires. Since, she's incapable of coming up with a better, much more creative idea. I don't mind the fact that they could come out during the day (since that's not unheard of in vampire fiction nowadays), but I wish that Meyer had come up with a better idea that didn't make me laugh uncontrollably at the thought. 

All the other myths about vampires are nonexistent. Holy water and garlic won't bother them (just like the sun), stake through the heart won't kill them either, even beheading them won't get rid of them. She made her vampires practically invincible (which is annoying). The only way to really kill one of her vampires is to rip it apart and burn the pieces or to blow it up. Two things that a human would have a hard time doing... which, makes me wonder why, if they're so invincible, they live in secrecy? Especially since (from my knowledge) most vampires don't live like the Cullens, they could careless about humans. If most other vampires were so cruel, why don't they come out to humanity and take over? It makes a lot more sense since a mere human would have a very difficult time killing just one vampire. The fact that they had no weaknesses annoyed the crap out of me. Along with being almost invincible, they all had these special ""powers"", but they didn't have the bad side effects with them, only the good. All in all, her vampires were perfect.

I don't like my vampires to be blood thirsty monsters that kill everything in sight. But, I also don't want them to be so pathetic and innocent either. The only two vampiric qualities that are there are the ones that are well known among everyone: drinking blood (well, sort of since the Cullens are ""vegetarian"" vampires; an idea that seriously made me laugh) and being immortal. Otherwise, the Cullens are disgustingly human like.

I think the thing I have the problem with the most is the fact that Meyer has never seen any vampire movies/t.v. shows or read any vampire novels. There's this saying in regards to writing: ""Write what you know"". Stephenie Meyer knew nothing about vampires when she wrote this horrible excuse for a vampire novel (which is probably why it was so awful in comparison to other vampire novels, whether those books are in the romance section of the bookstore or the horror/sci-fi section). A good author always does their research (whether it's fiction or non-fiction is irrelevant). This doesn't mean that she needed to go by the other myths, it just means that she should have done a little research to see what she was getting herself into. If she had done this, I would have been able to respect her ideas more because at least then she would have done her research. 

Where the vampires are concerned, this novel is an embarrassment to vampire/supernatural fiction.

7. Messages
I am somewhat appalled at the messages that this book sends out.. they are so anti-feminist, it's disgusting:
1. It's perfectly okay to have no goals or aspirations or even an education, just get yourself a man and he'll take care of you. (All Bella wants is to be with Edward, some aspirations, huh?)
2. It's also perfectly okay to like someone because of their physical features... this is not love people, it's lust! They have nothing in common! He likes her because she smells nice and she likes him because he's hot. (Bella goes on and on and on about how hot some part of Edward is every other page)
3. When you have several guys fawning over you pick the hottest one of them all because looks are so very important. (Mike and Eric pretty much say the same thing to Bella on her first day of school, but she's nicer to Mike than Eric because the latter wasn't very attractive. Also, she picks Edward because of his looks as well)
4. It's okay if the guy you love sneaks into your bedroom and watches you sleep at night (before you even know him all that well)... that's completely normal and romantic... not the the least bit creepy or stalkerish. (It's completely disgusting to hear girls talk about this. They swoon and gush about how romantic it is... seriously, what is wrong with people these days?!)
5. It is perfectly okay to become completely obsessed with your boyfriend and depend on him for everything.(Bella's obsession and dependence on Edward sets feminism back a couple hundred years or so)
6. It also teaches that not only is it okay to change yourself for a guy, but it's also okay to give up EVERYTHING for him as well. (Bella wants to become a vampire and leave her family and friends to be with Edward. What. The. Hell.)
7. Your life is not complete until you find a man. (This is nothing but a LIE. Girls do not need a man to be complete)

Like with the plot holes, I've been told that there are many more terrible messages in later books and once again, I'm not about to go out and read the books. However, I will say this... from what I've heard, they sound worse than the ones I've already listed.

8. The Obsession:
Well, this gets its own category, mostly because I just don't understand what all the obsession is over... it's a book, and a poorly written one at that. I run across girls all the time arguing over who Edward ""belongs"" to... it's pathetic and kind of scary. He's a book character... he doesn't belong to anyone, but Meyer, since she's the one who created him.

I also hate the fact that I can't go into the book store now without being bombarded with a huge display dedicated to this crappy series... makes me sick to see such praise and popularity for a mediocre book series when there are so much better authors out there that are virtually ignored since they write real fiction and none of this poorly written wish fulfillment fantasy crap.

This was obviously a fulfillment story that I would expect a preteen to write on her livejournal. This is not a book I would expect a thirty something year old woman with a college education to write and actually attempt and then succeed in getting published. And, it was a degree in English... seriously, I would have expected much better from someone who had that degree... since she spent college studying books and analyzing them etc. you would think that she would know how to write one the proper way...

Meyer could have made this book great, but no... instead she took the easy way out: a cliched, simple, overused plot and added vampires to it(as if that made it any different).

Honestly, I've read better over on fictionpress.com... and that's really sad, because most of the authors over there are between the ages of 14 and 26 and are amateurs in the field. Maybe, if Meyer had posted this up there first, it would have been a much better story because the good writers over there would have set her straight. Maybe then, I would have been able to get through the novel, because it might have actually been good!

And, oh just for the record... Twilight is NOT the next Harry Potter, nor is it better than Harry Potter... I say that not only because JK Rowling actually has talent, but also because they are in completely different genres and can't really be compared.

Though, it does make me sick to see Harry Potter even mentioned in the same sentence as this piece of crap... (unfortunately, that couldn't be avoided in this review) and it's an insult to JK Rowling to have her amazing writing compared to the horrible writing of Stephenie Meyer.

EDIT: I found this site, and thought I should share with everyone: http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.c...
The creator of the above site has scanned copies of the Twilight books on to her computer and has taken it upon herself to point out the many issues that the books have (these are mostly grammatical in nature). If you are a fangirl who believes that Twilight is perfect and has no flaws then you should really take a look at this."
351,S.A. Parham,Dracula,"Aug 13, 2007",1,"I was rather disappointed by this classic. It started out with promise, especially the Jonathan Harker bits. Then all the male characters descended into blubbering worshippers of the two female characters, and by the end of the novel, I was wishing Dracula could snack on all of them and be done with it. I kept having to put it aside and read chapters in between other books, but I managed to finish it at last."
352,Steph Sinclair,Twilight ,"Mar 10, 2011",1,"Actual rating: 1.5 stars. Believe it or not, there are actually a few books that are worse than Twilight.

Ok, funny story. I was sitting on my couch with my husband last night finishing up Twilight. I slammed the book shut and began rubbing my temples. Then, my husband goes, ""So you finally finished, huh?"" ""Yes. I can't believe I used to like this book,"" I said. ""Hahaha! Yeah, I remember you were on Twilight's balls hard."" Yeah, yeah, yeah...

There isn't a single book on my shelf that has fluctuated between all ratings besides Twilight. No, your eyes do not deceive you. I actually have read Twilight 4 times. I used to hail from Shelfari.com and the first rating I ever gave Twilight was 5 stars. After I made the switch to GoodReads, I decided to give it 4 stars instead. So, recently I was browsing my GoodReads shelf (I often do that to clean up ratings), I noticed Twilight was sitting pretty at 4 stars and was on my ""favorites"" shelf. At the time I thought, ""Wow, that's not accurate at all. Maybe it deserves 3 stars?"" But I quickly decided, no, no, no...I'll just do a fun little project and re-read the series and give them all better ratings. If your curious about the details of the project, stop on over here: Project: Hindsight. And hey, if you like what you see, won't you subscribe? Yes? /end shameless self promotion. 

The coolest thing about re-reading Twilight is that it has caused me to create really cool new shelves such as:

""Kill me now""




""Idiot heroine""




""This is *not* literature""




And my personal favorite: ""Where's my chocolate?""





One of the first things I noticed during this re-read was how incredibly boring it was. Bella is dull as a doorknob. And the first few chapters of the book are essentially a 'Bitch, Moan, Complain' session. So, we have Bella moving to Forks, WA because she wants her mother to be happy (more on that later). And she's all like, ""Ohhhh, I hate this place. It's green. Ewww, it's wet. Fuck my life."" And what's one of the first things Bella does when she arrives in Forks? She cooks Charlie dinner. 





No, I don't have an issue with a female character enjoying cooking, but it is practically thrown in my face that Charlie can't fend for himself; Bella has to cook. Well, what the hell was he doing before she arrived?! Oh, ya, did anyone else realize that despite the fact that she says she is not allowed to call Charlie by his first name; she almost always calls him Charlie? WTF. 

Bella goes to school and during lunch she first cast her eyes on the Cullen family. (view spoiler)[
  


(hide spoiler)] Her next period happens to be Biology (because that's where you'd meet a vampire, right?) and as she walks past the fan Edward goes: 



And she's like, ""WTF. Do I smell?"" Little does she know that Eddie just wants to devourer her little, ivory skinned ass. His reaction is so off-putting that she cries when she gets back to her truck. All because Eddie doesn't like her. Who the hell cares, Bella? Conceded much? Get over yourself. But no, she just obsesses with it. 
""Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. Everyday, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens had entered the cafeteria without him.""
 Meanwhile, poor Mike is trying to put the moves on Bella and invites her to a beach trip. Speaking of the beach trip, here is something the editors should have picked up on. When the beach trip is first brought up it's supposed to be happening in two weeks. But, as Bella goes on and on about nothing in particular, a few pages later she mentions 
""...just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks.""
 Wait, what? Anyone notice something? Six weeks have passed and the beach trip is where? Not only that, but the girl's choice dance was also two weeks away and here six weeks have passed...
""I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, almost two months ago.""
 Anyway, moving on. Some random shit happens causing Edward to swoop in and save danger prone Bella. The worst thing about Twilight is how incredibly dependent Bella is on Edward. When she's not with him, she is always thinking about him. And that doesn‚Äôt make any sense. She barely knows him. They've had like two or three conversations and she has thoughts like: 
""And what was my other choice--to cut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him.""
""It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now.""
""You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose.""
 And then, because Edward must always prove to Bella that he loves her more than she loves him, he pulls this line: 
""Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most because if I can do it---if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.""
 Are you kidding me? This is not love. But how could it be, with Edward torn between eating her and making out with her? Edward is a controlling creepy creeper. He had been watching her sleep for weeks before they started talking! Meyer are you condoning stalkish behavior?! 

Not.Fucking.Cool. 

I once read that Stephenie Meyer had a dream and that is how Twilight was born. She says she actually started writing from chapter 13 (The Meadow) to the ending. (view spoiler)[Oh, ya, that's where we find out Edward sparkles in the sun!  (hide spoiler)] Then, she went back and wrote the first half. It totally shows. While it's true the entire book is a shit storm in action, the second half is noticeably worse. The first half can easily be summed up as ""Bella's Bitch Fest meets Creep-ward"" and believe me when I say, it's really not as bad as the second half. How is that even possible? I have no idea, but Meyer pulls that shit off flawlessly. And ya know? I have a theory on that. Because Meyer had a dream about Bella and Edward and their 'true love' and she went to work on the second half before the first, there is all this raw emotions, strange pet names, and banter that's supposed to be romantic but fails miserably. I just felt terribly uncomfortable reading it. And to top it all off, it was so bad, like, eye bleeding bad! It made me so angry I actually pulled out a pen and started marking this damn book up. Don't believe me? LMAO, seriously folks, I took notes. Feast your eyes on my personal copy of Toilette Twilight (view spoiler)[That's French for toilet, stolen from Haleema. But I think the French word works pretty well. Hey, if you say it fast enough it sounds dangerously like Twilight. Just saying. (hide spoiler)].




I've also noticed a trend with Meyer. She doesn't write fight scenes. There was a huge build up for a fight with James and we see nothing of the fight. Bella is informed of what happened after the fact. Good job, Stephenie. You totally ripped off your readers there. So, Carlisle is sitting there fixing up Bella on the ground (and he randomly has Morphine, by the way -_-) and Bella is in the process of passing out. But first, Carlisle has a little conversation about Bella's mom and she somehow finds the will to mention to Alice what she knows about James. Like, really? Go to sleep Bella. You talk too much. 

I won't bore you with the details of the ending. I'm sure you already know. But I do want to say that Bella's mother is the most selfish character (next to Bella, of course). First she ships her off to Forks so she could be with her new husband. And no, do not tell me Bella chose to do that. Renee is the parent and it's *her* job to make sacrifices. Then, when Bella is in the hospital after the fight with James, she acts like she can't be bothered to stay with Bella. 
Then she sighed and glaced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall.
""Do you need to go?""
She bit her lip. ""Phil's supposed to call in a little while...I didn't know you were going to wake up...""
 Really?? Really, Renee?! Your daughter almost died and you are seriously acting like this? Un-fucking-believable. Oh, but this shit gets better: 
""I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,"" she announced, proud of herself.
 Huh? Do you want a cookie for that? It's your job! 
""I can stay if you need me.""
""No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me.""
She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay.
""I'll be back tonight."" Its sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it.
 And what does she think Edward and Bella are going to do? She has a broken leg, broken ribs, and cracks in her skull. C'mon now!

Then Edward takes Bella to prom, he kisses her neck. The fucking end.
Would I recommend this? Bahahahahahah! You're shitting me, right? I'm about to go do this to my bookshelf:




But I'll tell you what I recommend. I recommend we all do this to our copies of Toilette. 



Amen.

I asked a question in a spoiler, ""How come Valjean never recognised Th√©nardier no matter how many times he met him?"" And just now I had an ah-ha moment and realised it was because Victor Hugo himself might well have had prosopagnosia.

How did I get to this? I reviewed Oliver Sacks' On the Move and made a point about his prosopagnosia, face blindness, I have it too. It just struck me that although it is very odd for the hero never to recognise his enemy, if the author had prosopagnosia he wouldn't think it at all strange that Valjean might have people he never recognised (as well as those he always did and those he sometimes did) because that's how it is with face blindness. Of course, I will never know for sure, but it makes more sense to me to think of it this way.
______

I loved this book. I was expecting something somewhere between Trollope's extraordinary writing and Zola's wonderful stories - and I got it! Great literature indeed, and what a character Jean Valjean is. 

His story is almost biblical, one of redemption. One who travels the path from evil to good with scarcely a stumble but many an obstruction along the way. Hugo uses the book, much as Tolstoy liked to do, to expound his personal philosophy and also the condition of the peasants, les miserables.

(view spoiler)[Good, excellent, as the book was, I am left with one question, how come Valjean never recognised Th√©nardier no matter how many times he met him? (hide spoiler)]

If you like classics and sagas, its a good holiday book. Start before you go, read it on the plane, a little by the pool and when lying on the beach, and then when you get home, there will still be more to read about these people who are your friends and family now."

357,Ms. Smartarse,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass ,"May 18, 2022",4,"Between its many animated and live action movie adaptations over the years, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland turned into this weird psychedelic drug-induced hallucination, rather than the original irony-filled charming children's story in my mind. 
So it was high-time for a reread.

I wouldn't call myself a particularly perceptive person, having focused more on the many absurd adventures rather than the irony, as a child. So the constant barrage of ""a-HA"" moments that I now found myself experiencing, came as very welcome surprise. I love a book that ages well, especially when it reads like a completely different story at varying times in life.



The contrast between Alice's educated demeanor, and its (lack of) use in real life situation was fun to follow. Alice's fumbling attempts at making use of the French lessons, while unintentionally insulting the mouse, hit quite close to home.

Nevertheless, I have mixed feelings about the protagonist's curiosity/bravery, which would often come across as rather thoughtless and/or selfish. Take for instance that Mad Hatter's tea party, which she joins uninvited, only to then feel offended by the participants' (lack of) manners and amenities.





 Alice's Adventures Through The Looking Glass features a much more intriguing premise, but is also much more boring to get through. Admittedly, I know precisely nothing about chess, so the many clever game references would've gone right over my head without the footnotes. The overall effect seemed much closer to an ambitious endeavour, than a story with a natural flow.

If the prequel gave us a story featuring several comedic episodes, this one seemed a series of funny banters, that so happened to have a story linking them together. It was still good, but the overall narration didn't flow quite as naturally as before.

Score: 3.5/5 stars

4 rounded-up stars for nostalgia and writing style
I would advise skipping the footnotes; while the poem references were useful, the emphasis put on the inspiration behind one or more of the events got tiring after a while. Like in the episode from  Alice's Adventures Through The Looking Glass where Alice forgets her name, and only remembers it's something with ""L"". The footnotes insist this is a reference to ""Liddel"", while I found it more likely to be a pun on how ""Al"" from ""Alice"" has the same pronunciation as the letter ""L"".



... plus the creepy revelation, that Charles Dodgson used to intentionally ""cultivate friendships"" with young girls, rather put me off any subsequent rereads. I probably shouldn't have googled documentaries on the subject."
358,Kinga,Fahrenheit 451,"Dec 05, 2012",2,"It‚Äôs easy to see why ‚ÄòFarenheit 451‚Äô is a cult classic, beloved by the majority of bookworms. Oh, it validates us, doesn‚Äôt it? Here is a future world where books are banned, and look at this; it has gone to the dogs. The saddest of all post-apocalyptic worlds, the bleakest dystopia, what a nightmare ‚Äì NO BOOKS!

The good are those who read, the bad are those who watch the TV. Yes, this is what we like to read to make us feel all warm inside. And because of that we are seemingly willing to forgive Bradbury for a lot of things: really poor world-building skills, lacklustre characterisation, inconsistencies. 

Oh, and sexism. The women in the books are generally brainwashed bimbos, except of course for the wonder-child Clarisse from the beginning of the book, who is a representation of a very annoying archetype as well. 

And you would think that, since the book is mostly an endless roll call of all the authors and books that need to be salvaged from the fire, at least ONE female author would get a mention. Nope. Zero. They can all burn for all that Bradbury cares. After all, the secret gang dedicated to preserving the world literary heritage is made up entirely of men. Now, this to me does look like a very sad world indeed.

Go and read Farenheit 451. It‚Äôs not a novel in its fully developed sense, more of an allegory, a hyperbole and Bradbury occasionally produces sentences of startling beauty. The problem with this book is the same problem there is with a world without books ‚Äì it‚Äôs somewhat flat, somewhat numb."
359,Danielle The Book Huntress *Pluto is a Planet!*,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Jan 16, 2009",5,"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a hard book to review. After reading such eloquent, beautiful, and rich writing, I am at a loss for how to command my comparatively paltry ability to use words to express how I felt about this book.

Forgive me as I go back to AP English for a few moments. I asked myself what were the themes of this novel. Here is my list:

Identity
Experience 
Beauty
The triumph on senses over reason
Accountability

I will attempt to build my review, in part, around the discussion of these themes.

Identity
Dorian Gray was a flawed man who was essentially empty inside. He was very young when this story began, seemingly full of potential. Sadly, he invested all his sense of worth in his external beauty, doing little to grow the inner man; unless you consider his descent into depravity, discovering more and more excesses for the meaningless value of those experiences (since his mentor Lord Henry taught him that experience has no value), yet he was strangely curious as to how they would affect the portrait of his soul. He was not quite a tragic figure, because I could not feel sorry for him. He had made this horrible decision (and I believe he had opportunities to repent of it, which he didn't take), but he chose never to take responsibility for himself. Which leads to the next theme.

Accountability
As I said above, I could feel no sympathy for Dorian Gray. Why? Because he never took responsibility for his actions. Being accountable for one's own actions is a crucial aspect of self-development, at least in my humble opinion. If a person cannot do that, they are doomed to eternal immaturity. This was Dorian's fate. It was Basil's fault for painting the picture. It was Sybil's fault for being a bad actress, and making him fall out of love with her. All the people he ruined in his relentless pursuit of pleasure and debauchery ruined themselves. He took no part in their ruination. Ultimately, he even blamed the picture, and sought to destroy it as the only true evidence of his black soul. I feel like this: If you're going to be a bad, selfish person, own up to it. Don't try to act like your sins should be laid at other people's feet. That was the route the Mr. Dorian Gray took.

Experience
Lord Henry was the man who opens Dorian's eyes to the fact that the only thing he has to his advantage is the beauty of his youth, that he should enjoy life while he is young enough to experience it fully. He states that experience is not a teacher, and that men don't learn from the mistakes they make as they live. Your experiences don't count for anything. It seemed to be a self-fulfilling prophecy for Dorian Gray. Instead of realizing how his selfish, shallow actions could hurt and destroy others, he never did do that. He merely went from one fixation to the other, marking the effects on the portrait that he guarded jealously. In the end, there was no value to what he experienced. He was just wasting time (in my opinion).

The triumph of sensation over reason
Dorian Gray became a voluptuary, lost in sensations. He didn't focus on becoming a learned person, only experiencing what he encountered in his pursuits, wallowing in those sensations; until he grew bored, and moved onto the next one. Lord Henry seemed like a good mentor. A man who appeared so intelligent, with a saying for everything. A witty, entertaining man, who had a reputation for saying utterly wicked things. But he wasn't a deep man. He didn't believe what he said. It was an image that he projected for lack of anything else to do as an aristocrat who had no need to work for a living. Dorian Gray took this as gospel, and took it to the next level. As a result, it made his life utterly meaningless. Sadly, his friend Basil, who was a fairly wise person, was dismissed, and made fun of by Lord Henry. I almost felt like Basil and Lord Henry were the warring aspects of Dorian's conscience, at times.

Beauty
What is beauty? I tend to think it's a double-edged sword. We are all attracted to things that are beautiful, that have a physical appeal. But, should we be content with merely a comely appearance, while the inside is rotted? Dorian Gray was a man of such unearthly beauty that people could not believe he was capable of the debauchery he had committed. Those who didn't heed the warnings given to them, came to rue it. Basil, who painted the young Dorian's fateful picture, couldn't accept that Dorian had become such a horrible person. What a sad fate that was for Basil.


I felt several things as I read this book: interest, curiosity, disgust, sadness, and ultimately, a sense that justice had been done, in a very strange, but fitting way.

One thing that became very apparent to me as I read this novel, was Oscar Wilde's considerable wit. I imagine he was quite entertaining to be around. 

In the preface, Oscar Wilde says that all art is meaningless. What was he trying to say with this story? Nothing? 

 I have trouble believing that. This was a novel I couldn't dismiss and treat as mere brain candy. There was some message there that hammered away at my brain. I do believe that Mr. Wilde hints at the subjective nature of art (which includes literature). I think that we could all read the same story and take away different things from it. Our brains are so very different, and the pathways are nurtured and developed by our various experiences, and our own values. So, that we will all come away from viewing a picture or reading a story with a hand-tailored message. Maybe that's what he means by saying that an artist strives not to be present in his work. Instead, it is a mirror reflecting the viewer. That makes sense to me, actually.

What message did I come away with?

At the end of the day, I believe that Dorian Gray led a worthless life. His eternal youth counted for nothing. He never grew as a person, and he used the bounteous gifts he'd been given selfishly. He did horrible things that made it even worse. He was lucky in that he didn't live long enough to count the full cost of those actions. He allowed the portrait to take the weight of those sins intead of letting them rest where they belonged. If anything really bothers me as a person, it's the thought of my time on this earth being wasted. Never having accomplished anything of value. For that reason, I found Dorian Gray to be a very sad man, but I could not feel sorry for him.

So, is this a horror novel, you might ask? 

I think this is a thinking person's horror novel. It is a study of how the sins we commit cannot be hidden, even if we lie to ourselves about that. Interestingly enough, Mr. Wilde does not elaborate on what vile acts Dorian committed. We are left to our own expansive imaginations to surmise the bulk of what he'd done. Some people don't believe in such a thing as sin. If you don't believe in sin, how could it have a cost? It didn't matter that Dorian Gray didn't acknowledge his sins. They caught up with him in the end. The horror is how he confronted the consequences of his sins, yet turned away from them, locking that manifestation away in the attic to view with a detached sort of curiosity. The horror is the lives he destroyed, but never felt more than a moment's remorse. Fundamentally, Dorian Gray was an angelically beautiful monster. The horror is that we can look upon beauty, and we can be fooled into never asking what lies beneath it."
360,Reader-ramble,Divergent ,"Mar 19, 2013",1,"Okay, so the movie came out on disk, and I was surfing one of my favorite channels on YouTube, when I found this video by CinemaSins. It's a fun and irreverent bit of criticism. Enjoy!

Since I managed to get 100 likes before the movie came out, I will be reviewing Insurgent and Allegiant in the future. It may be a while though. Life is a bit in the way.

Okay, time to get serious. I wish I could be funny like my Mortal Instrument reviews, but my intellectual has kicked in because this book manages to be defined as part of a genre that I have always adored, especially in short stories.

Before I begin, my usual disclaimer that this review will contain logic, griping, complaining, spoilers, and the general deconstruction of everything that the fans hold dear. If you wish to berate me for this, don't waste your time. Nothing you say will convince me. This book is just that bad.

So, my initial reaction was thus:



Dramatic, I know. But not as dramatic as wanting to take a shot gun or lighter to a library book. I'm at least glad I didn't pay for it.

To get into the mood, some foreplay.

Beatrice - the main character - lives in a Chicago where everyone is divided up into six groups. The Abnegation (selfless people), Dauntless (brave people), Erudite (intelligent people), Amity (friendly people), Candor (honest people), and the Factionless. When a child reaches sixteen, they must take a test that will tell them what faction they belong into, but then they still get to pick the faction. Now, each faction has a specific lot in life.

Let's break it down, shall we?

Abnegation: (Noun) The act of instance of abnegating, or denying oneself some rights, conveniences, etc. This is Beatrice's faction. They are supposed to be entirely selfless. They wear all gray, eat insipid food, and everything is considered self-indulgent to them. You could say they are beyond Amish. Oh, and every member of the government is Abnegation. Every member. Yeah. They're referred to as ""selfless leaders in government"" at one point, but when is it ever smart to have one faction in control? Here is the kicker, they aren't the bad guys. They actually don't do anything wrong that an oppressive regime would do, like make the rest of the factions give up ""indulgences"" or go to mass every day. They are doormats.

Dauntless: (Adjective) Not to be intimidated; fearless; intrepid; bold. This is the faction Beatrice joins. They are defined as ""protection from threats both within and without."" They are the security forces of Roth Chicago. The truth is that the Dauntless are reckless idiots. Their transportation is a train that never stops, so they must jump from it. They dye their hair, get piercings and tattoos, and wear tight clothes. They are more like rebellious high schoolers than a militant force. I'll write more about them later since the reader spends the most time with this faction. I'll at least add that they are proof of Roth's lazy writing.

Erudite: (Adjective) Characterized by great knowledge; learned or scholarly. The faction Beatrice's brother, Caleb, joins. The book defines them as ""intelligent teachers and researchers."" If a society could have and R&D department, this would be it. I'm sad to say that smart people are not depicted well in this story. They are shown to be smug, mean, and power hungry. There are no scientists who understand that scientific break-throughs are a double edged blade; one side will do good and another evil. This faction is the bad guy because they believe the Abnegation are holding back prosperity and progress. That would make sense if their way of going about it wasn't so stupid. Slander and brainwashing never works in the end.

Amity: (Noun) (1) Friendship; peaceful harmony. (2) Mutual understanding and a peaceful relationship, especially between nations; peace, accord. Book defines as ""understanding counselors and caretakers."" They do the farming and smile a lot. That's the extent of it.

Candor: (Noun) (1) The state or quality of being frank, open, and sincere in speech or expression; candidness. (2) Freedom from bias; fairness; impartiality. Most of Beatrice's fellow Dauntless initiates are from Candor. The book defines them as ""trustworthy and sound leaders in law."" Yes. They are all lawyers that we know of. They're supposed to be honest people, but they're honest to the point of being rude and come across as being quite judgmental. They also dress like Mormon missionaries because they believe the truth is black and white. How has a faction full of completely honest people not killed each other already? It would be like living with a bunch of Sherlocks in a John Grisham novel.

The Factionless: Those that did not pass the initiation for their chosen factions or dropped out. They are essentially homeless day laborers who are paid in food and clothes. They live in old subway tunnels. No body loves them or wants to be them. The only thing people fear more than being factionless is the prospect of war. No executions or murders or anything like that. Just being factionless and an abstract idea of war. I have a headache now.

Okay, now that we have the basics, what is the economy like? Oh, Roth doesn't tell us. Then what world shattering event led to the formation of the factions? It says they were formed by different people who believed those were the most important traits, but not why? No bad weather. No nuclear war. No civil war. No raising tides. Nothing. Nada. Then why is Lake Michigan an effing marsh? Not only that, but do you know how many cities there are on the edges of Lake Michigan? How are they not fighting Chicago over water if it's scarce?



Okay. Okay. Maybe I'm over-thinking her TOTAL LACK OF WORLD BUILDING. I mean, I've seen more world building in short stories, and the short story format isn't even set up for world building. Despite the little bit of information on the factions, the reader knows almost nothing about this society Roth has set up. None of it makes a lick of sense. If I sat down and mapped out how the different functions interacted and what held them together, there would be squat. It's more entirely dysfunctional than a dystopia. And what makes a dystopia exactly?

I believe this paragraph from John Joseph Adam's Introduction from his anthology of dystopian short stories, Brave New Worlds, sums it up the best:


The roots of the word dystopia, dys- and -topia, are from the Ancient Greek for ""bad"" and ""place,"" and so we use the term to describe and unfavorable society in which we live. ""Dystopia"" is not a synonym of ""post-apocalyptic""; it also is not a synonym for a bleak, or darkly imagined future. In a dystopian feature, society itself is typically the antagonist; it is society that is actively working against the protagonist's aims and desires. This oppression frequently is enacted by a totalitarian of authoritarian government, resulting in the loss of civil liberties and untenable living conditions, caused by any number of circumstances, such as world overpopulation, law's controlling a person's sexual or reproductive freedom, and living under constant surveillance.

Now, I would love to put almost the entirety of Adam's tiny essay here, but there isn't enough room for it with this stinking word count limit. My point is, Divergence isn't a dystopia.

""But what about Tris being a Divergent, and not being able to see her brother, and being torn from her family? How is that not a dystopia? It's bad!""

Not necessarily. You see, because the Abnegation run the government, technically they can control the other factions, but they don't. They're inept. They actually have no way to enforce the rules that everyone follows. They have no security force of their own, or punishments. This society could not exist because it could not function.

""But the Erudite were in charge! And the brainwashing!""

The Erudite weren't in charge at first, and even then, not everyone would have been behind it. Also, the Abnegation's viewpoint on the world doesn't give them the back bone to push against at least three factions of obnoxious individuals. They should have toppled from power generations ago, but since Roth never gives us an idea about how long her Chicago has been around, the reader doesn't know. This society is not plausible. At. All.

Watch. Get five friends together and each have them represent a faction. Then have Selfless tell Intelligence, Honesty, and Muscle what to do. Think about it. Even the US Armed Forces push back against Congress. 

""But she explains all your gripes in Insurgent.""

Then let me talk about Tris, the main character.



She is the daughter of an Abnegation government official. She is small for her size and built like a boy. She wishes she was more selfless like her family, but instead lies and wishes vengeance on just about everyone that hurts her. She is a giant hypocrite.

Take her fight with Molly after she's ""pantsed"" in the dorm. Tris keep's kicking her while she's down out of vengeance. That is just petty and mean. If she keeps wishing she's selfless, that would be a moment where she could demonstrate it. And Al after he apologizes for trying to hurt her, she doesn't forgive him. Tris is a horrible, horrible person. She isn't Divergent. She's Dauntless through and through. She is not selfless, honest, smart, or friendly. She's suspicious, spiteful, and dense. 

If she was the least bit pretty, I'd get why Four was into her. But she isn't, so I don't.

And that brings me straight to our hunky hero who is oh, so dreamy. He's a virgin, hot, wounded, and mysterious. He only has four fears. That is why he has a nickname reserved for science experiments. Isn't he the best!



Four has about as much life as a Ken doll. Probably the genitals of one too. His real importance is that he's also a Divergent.

Now I will talk about Divergents and the nuances of Dauntless now that I've brought up Tris and bitched about how this is not a dystopia.

I've already said that Dauntless were crazy people that do stupid stuff to seem brave. Roth tries to make the initiates go through a difficult training regimen, but they only beat on each other. There is no learning of throws, holds, or grabs. No learning of efficient ways to take down enemies without killing them or brutally beating them. Roth doesn't even know that most fights are won in the grapple. It's like she did no research about how to train security based forces what so ever.

It's even more apparent when she brings in guns. Yes, guns. To Roth, they are never rifles or pistols. They are never semi-auto or bolt action. She doesn't even know what a magazine is. Need an example?

""She pushes the bullet chamber open and peers inside. Seeing how many bullets she has left. Then takes a few out of her pocket and reloads.""


Unless the gun is a revolver, which is unspecified, the magazine would have to be removed to see how much ammo is left and to reload it. And if I'm running around with a semi-auto pistol, I would try to carry loaded magazines with me instead of individual bullets if possible. Seriously, just the technical knowledge alone was torture to get through. I don't need to know how to field strip a P-90, but at least the basics is needed when you are writing about a militant faction.

And the Divergent thing. Basically, they can't be brainwashed. Roth tries to justify it wish an explanation given by Tris' mom:

""But our minds move in a dozen different directions. We can't be confined to one way of thinking, and that terrifies our leaders. It means we can't be controlled. And it means that no matter what they do, we will always cause trouble for them.""
Do you see the problem with that one? Do you?

First off, they are Abnegation. THEY ARE THE LEADERS.

Second, I don't think Roth has ever read 1984, Brave New World, or Fahrenheit 451 where a bulk of the population's way of thinking was quite successfully controlled through fear or bliss. Sure, there were a few outliers, but in two of the three, they were dealt with through discreet means. And the sad thing, all three of those futures have come true in some sense or another. We will never come anywhere close to the world depicted in Divergence.

So, to sum it all up because I don't have enough words to keep going into the massive problems this book has, don't bother. Read The Hunger Games if you haven't yet (even though I thought Collins kind of dropped the ball in Mockingjay). Or you could pick up the anthology I mentioned earlier since it has awesome dystopia shorts written by women like Shirley Jackson, Usula K. Le Guin, and Carrie Vaughn. Or read anything else really.

And if anyone wants me to do Insurgent, I would have to get 100 likes on this review. Even if I do, I can't guarantee this wouldn't happen after I read it.



So it's been fun. I'm going to go bleach my brain now.


Edit 8/16/2013: There is this thing I've been thinking of for some time now. The Dauntless are always trying to have these kids get rid of fears. There is this saying that I think people should keep in mind, ""Those without fear are missing a good friend.""

If you don't quite understand it, it means that those who are fearless don't have an important survival mechanism. Fear is what stimulates the ""fight or flight"" response that sends adrenaline coursing through our veins. Bravery is controlling your fear, utilizing it, not getting rid of it. It really bothered me that this book interpreted bravery as the absence of fear. Bravery, courage, is taking a step forward and facing the thing that makes you want to piss yourself and dive for cover.

But fear should also be listened to. If someone says you have to jump off a building to prove yourself, and you know you could die, true bravery would be to look them in the eye and tell them it's stupid and pointless. It's to stand up for yourself.

Take the fact that Four turns down the position that Shower Curtain (Eric) takes over. That was cowardly. It would have been braver for him to take the position so he could protect the students from the corruption. He could also try to dismantle the corrupt from the inside out. Yeah, it's more dangerous, but if this book is supposed to be about utilizing your fear for change, then that would have been a perfect little parallel sub-plot. It's a shame Roth isn't a more talented writer."
361,"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies",Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Jun 10, 2012",5,"Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read.

Once upon a time, there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn't get along with people very well. She wasn't an outcast in school, and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school, but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts.



Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating, but to sitting in the library, browsing through books.

(Not to worry, she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M&M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and/or a package of Reese's Pieces. Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)

One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's ""New Releases"" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.

At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel. She had read the Outlander series earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.

And that did not include Harry Potter. Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14. There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was a teenager, dammit.

But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader. And Khanh was tempted.

She picked up the first book in the series: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

The end.

Or rather, the beginning."
362,Matthew,The Great Gatsby,"Jan 08, 2013",5,"Re-read update August 2020

My history with Gatsby

First read in high school: 1 star
Rethinking my rating a few years ago after watching movie and discussing book with my wife (see original review below) : 3 stars
Re-read rating in 2020: 5 stars

Interesting anecdote to accompany my re-read. I did it on audio this time, headed out to listen to it (double time) on a walk yesterday, and 8.6 miles later I had listened to the whole thing straight through!

So glad I gave this one another shot. It's pretty good - definitely worthy of 5 stars. If you remember it poorly because of a required reading experience, I think it is worth revisiting.

Here is my original review from January 8th, 2013:

When I first reviewed this on Goodreads, I gave it 1 star. I just did not remember enjoying it as required reading in High School.

Then I went through a phase a couple of years ago where I read a lot of Hemingway and about Hemingway (The Paris Wife), and with Hemingway you get a lot of Fitzgerald.

Shortly after that, the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio came out and my wife's book club read the book. We ended up discussing the book for hours and watched the movie. After that I had to change my rating.

I only brought it up to 3 because it is still not one of my favorites, but I get it more now (update August 2020 - now 5 stars!). There is a whole lot of interesting content packed into an under 200 page book (how they made a 2 1/2 hour movie, I'll never know - but they kept it pretty close to the source material). I also think this book is very representative of the time period and the type of writing you were seeing in the ""Jazz Age"". Because of this, it is an important piece of literature."
363,Paul Bryant,Of Mice and Men,"Sep 25, 2007",3,"The title of this novel is only 50% accurate, a very poor effort. Yes, it‚Äôs about men, but there‚Äôs little or nothing about mice in these pages. Mice enthusiasts will come away disappointed. This got me thinking about other novel titles. You would have to say that such books as The Slap, The Help, The Great Gatsby, Gangsta Granny, Mrs Dalloway and Hamlet have very good titles because they are all about a slap, some help, a Gatsby who was really great, a no good granny, a woman who was married to a guy called Dalloway and a Hamlet. I have no problem with those titles. But you may be poring over the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird for a long fruitless evening to find any mockingbirds coming to any harm at all. Indeed, to coin a phrase, no mockingbirds were harmed during the making of that book. So I rate that title only 5% accurate. And some titles seem to have a word missing, such as Conan Doyle‚Äôs The Sign of Four. Four what? It doesn‚Äôt say. Perhaps he completed the book and left the title to the very last minute and died as he was writing it down. Same thing with The Crimson Petal and the White.  White what? Wallpaper? Hat? Cat? Mouse? Mockingbird? Could be The Crimson Petal and the White Gangsta Granny for all we know. A poor title. And what about The Dharma Bums? I think a Cigarette or You Out is clearly missing from that title. Another grossly misleading title is Women in Love . I can‚Äôt be the only reader who was expecting some strong girl on girl action from DH Lawrence but I would have been better off fast-forwarding to the middle part of Mulholland Drive.  Now that‚Äôs what I call Women in Love.  DH, take note. Another badly chosen title is Hitler‚Äôs Niece - yes, it is 100% accurate, but at first glance it can look like Hitler‚Äôs Nice, and surely that is going to put off a lot of potential readers (except for the readers you really don‚Äôt want). 

And what about Call it Sleep? ‚Äì call what sleep? 

The Catcher in the Rye, The Postman Always Rings Twice, Flaubert‚Äôs Parrot, The Camomile Lawn ‚Äì sometimes obscure titles can be solved if you understand that the author is referring to Death, so, the Catcher is Death, the Postman is Death, the lawn is Death and the Parrot is Death. Of course, I may have got that wrong. It‚Äôs something I read somewhere and it just stuck in my mind. 


Some other titles I would give low ratings to :
 
The Turn of the Screw  completely baffled me ‚Äì I know that ‚Äúscrew‚Äù is what inmates call prison officers, so I was expecting a story about a concert put on by the staff of a large correctional institution. It was nothing like that. 

The Little Prince according to my system does rate 100% but I still think The Little Faux-naif Idiot would have been better.

The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay ‚Äì actually, I rate this as 90% accurate ‚Äì there are two guys who are named Kavalier and Clay, and they do have adventures, but they aren‚Äôt amazing. 

A Clockwork Orange ‚Äì this must be a metaphor for ‚ÄúI have given up thinking of a title for my novel‚Äù

No Name ‚Äì like A Clockwork Orange this must be where the author couldn‚Äôt think of any title so in this case he left it without one, like the Byrds‚Äô album Untitled, or  () by Sigur Ros, or several paintings by De Kooning and those other abstract expressionist types; but to call a novel No Name is self-defeating, because No Name then becomes its name ‚Äì epic fail, Mr Collins.

The Violent Bear it Away - this is another example of a word missing - possibly ""took"" or ""dragged"", I expect that's the sort of thing a violent bear would do I‚Äôm surprised the publisher did not catch this error."
364,Anna,Animal Farm,"Nov 10, 2018",5,"ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS !
In the start, I thought this book would be from the view point of animals; about how they are treated, how they expect to be treated and how man is cruel towards them.
But but but;
I am amazed at how Orwell criticizes the political maneuvers and totalitarian rule, using animals to explain what humans do. The author beautifully portrays the way a revolution is started to stop what is happening and going full circle comes to the same point it started from. Just the face of power is changed. 
This book tells how the ruling class makes fool of the working class, uses their energies and resources for their own pleasure. What happens behind the closed doors of power. 
How the working class is being brain washed that they are happy and satisfied and free despite of the obvious slavery they have been undergoing. 
My favorite character was Benjamin (yes, a donkey) , who remains a neutral throughout and says nothing despite understanding everything.
A huge applause to Orwell for being able to explain human psyche, political and social dilemma wrapped in the form of this story."

No es la historia de amor convencional y color rosa que uno pudiera pensar, todo lo contrario, sin embargo, me deja el coraz√≥n hecho pedacitos con ese final."
366,Erin,Brave New World,"Feb 29, 2008",0,"remember that last semester of english class, senior year, where every class seemed painfully long and excrutiatingly pointless? when everybody sat around secretly thinking of cute and witty things to put in other people's yearbooks? when the teachers realized we were already braindead from filling out three dozen student loan applications and college housing forms? that's when honors english started getting a little lazy. 

not that i minded. everybody got a book list. then everybody got split up into groups. you were responsible for reading all the books on your own, but one in particular was chosen for your group to present at the end of the semester. you know--- as a refresher for the rest of the class. because of course EVERYONE was gonna read EVERY book.

i can't remember what i did instead of reading ""brave new world"", but it was probably fun and involved copious amounts of sweet tea and a gigantic paper mache cow. fortunately it didn't matter because the only group to take their presentation seriously was the ""brave new world"" group, and the way they presented stuck with me long enough to compel me to read the book later.

maybe it was the weird music they had playing during their presentation, maybe it was the fact that super hot chris mayns had to sit in my group (the alphas) but i was seriously attracted to the world this group created in our classroom. we drew cards randomly to determine our class, then sat accordingly and wore cute little colored wristbands. everybody got pez (soma!) and *gasp* a birth control belt. throughout the presentation people were moved next to someone and lost a packet on their belt (listen, this is scandalous for a bible belt high school, ok? by the way, i did NOT get to sit next to chris, which is probably good because i would have been mortified and choked on a pez) 

anyway, the presentation was fun, but i didn't get around to reading my (now ex) boyfriends copy until a year ago. and i started getting a small, evil thought exactly the same as i had in class so many years ago... maybe some people would actually like this system. maybe some people would actually BENEFIT from this system. people don't have to think? they aren't expected to do much, go to college, become something bigger than what they actually are? they're rewarded with good feeling drugs? they are proud to have accomplished what they have? and they... DON'T HAVE TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES!?

I know i'm going to get slammed for saying this later, especially because i never do actual reviews or completely delve into what i'm thinking (so shoot me) but haven't you ever been roaming the world wide inter-web and found a little troller you thought ""well, this person is a poor use of a human brain?"" yes, you have. admit it.

just think, a little test tube tweaking and that person wouldn't mind manning the cash register at piggly wiggly for the rest of his life, saving the rest of humanity from noxious online rants about the hotness of avril lavinge and the brilliance of starcraft (apparently its a video game thats KOOLER THAN U!!!!1#)

you're tempted, i can tell..."
367,Shannon,The Book Thief,"Dec 25, 2007",5,"This is a book to treasure, a new classic. I absolutely loved it.

Set in Germany in the years 1939-1943, The Book Thief tells the story of Liesel, narrated by Death who has in his possession the book she wrote about these years. So, in a way, they are both book thieves. Liesel steals randomly at first, and later more methodically, but she's never greedy. Death pockets Liesel's notebook after she leaves it, forgotten in her grief, amongst the destruction that was once her street, her home, and carries it with him.

Liesel is effectively an orphan. She never knew her father, her mother disappears after delivering her to her new foster parents, and her younger brother died on the train to Molching where the foster parents live. Death first encounters nine-year-old Liesel when her brother dies, and hangs around long enough to watch her steal her first book, The Gravedigger's Handbook, left lying in the snow by her brother's grave.

Her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Herbermann, are poor Germans given a small allowance to take her in. Hans, a tall, quiet man with silver eyes, is a painter (of houses etc.) and plays the accordian. He teaches Liesel how to read and write. Rosa is gruff and swears a lot but has a big heart, and does laundry for rich people in the town. Liesel becomes best friends with her neighbour Rudy, a boy with ""hair the colour of lemons"" who idolises the black Olympic champion sprinter Jesse Owens. 

One night a Jew turns up in their home. He's the son of a friend of Hans from the first world war, the man who taught him the accordian, whose widowed wife Hans promised to help if she ever needed it. Hans is a German who does not hate Jews, though he knows the risk he and his family are taking, letting Max live in the basement. Max and Liesel become close friends, and he writes an absolutely beautiful story for her, called The Standover Man, which damn near broke my heart. It's the story of Max, growing up and coming to Liesel's home, and it's painted over white-painted pages of Mein Kampf, which you can see through the paint.

Whenever I read a book, I cannot help but read it in two ways: the story itself, and how it's written. They're not quite inseparable, but they definitely support each other. With The Book Thief, Markus Zusak has shown he's a writer of genius, an artist of words, a poet, a literary marvel. His writing is lyrical, haunting, poetic, profound. Death is rendered vividly, a lonely, haunted being who is drawn to children, who has had a lot of time to contemplate human nature and wonder at it. Liesel is very real, a child living a child's life of soccer in the street, stolen pleasures, sudden passions and a full heart while around her bombs drop, maimed veterans hang themselves, bereaved parents move like ghosts, Gestapo take children away and the dirty skeletons of Jews are paraded through the town.

Many things save this book from being all-out depressing. It's never morbid, for a start. A lively humour dances through the pages, and the richness of the descriptions as well as the richness of the characters' hearts cannot fail to lift you up. Also, it's great to read such a balanced story, where ordinary Germans - even those who are blond and blue-eyed - are as much at risk of losing their lives, of being persecuted, as the Jews themselves.

I can't go any further without talking about the writing itself. From the very first title page, you know you're in for something very special indeed. The only way to really show you what I mean is to select a few quotes (and I wish I was better at keeping track of lines I love).

""As he looked uncomfortably at the human shape before him, the young man's voice was scraped out and handed across the dark like it was all that remained of him."" (p187) 

""Imagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day. That was the business of hiding a Jew."" (p.239)

""The book was released gloriously from his hand. It opened and flapped, the pages rattling as it covered ground in the air. More abruptly than expected, it stopped and appeared to be sucked towards the water. It clapped when it hit the surface and began to float downstream."" (p.325)

""So many humans. So many colours. They keep triggering inside me. They harass my memory. I see them tall in their heaps, all mounted on top of each other. There is air like plastic, a horizon like setting glue. There are skies manufactured by people, punctured and leaking, and there are soft, coal-coloured clouds, beating, like black hearts. And then. There is death. Making his way through all of it. On the surface: unflappable, unwavering. Below: unnerved, untied, and undone."" (p.331)

""After ten minutes or so, what was most prominent in the cellar was a kind of non-movement. Their bodies were welded together and only their feet changed position or pressure. Stillness was shackled to their faces. They watched each other and waited."" (p.402)

""People and Jews and clouds all stopped. They watched. As he stood, Max looked first at the girl and then stared directly into the sky who was wide and blue and magnificent. There were heavy beams - planks of sun - falling randomly, wonderfully, onto the road. Clouds arched their backs to look behind as they started again to move on. ""It's such a beautiful day,"" he said, and his voice was in many pieces. A great day to die. A great day to die, like this."" (pp.543-4)
Writing like this is not something just anyone can do: it's true art. Only a writer of Zusak's talent could make this story work, and coud get away with such a proliferation of adjectives and adverbs, to write in such a way as to revitalise the language and use words to paint emotion and a vivid visual landscape in a way you'd never before encountered. This is a book about the power of words and language, and it is fitting that it is written in just such this way. 

The way this book was written also makes me think of a musical, or an elaborate, flamboyant stage-play. It's in the title pages for each part, in Death's asides and manner of emphasing little details or even speech, in the way Death narrates, giving us the ending at the beginning, giving little melodrammatic pronouncements that make you shiver. It's probably the first book I've read that makes me feel how I feel watching The Phantom of the Opera, if that helps explain it.

And it made me cry."
368,Lisa of Troy,Memoirs of a Geisha,"May 31, 2022",2,"Arthur Golden‚Äôs Memoirs of a Geisha is set in Japan from The Great Depression through just after World War II. A young girl named Chiyo moves from her small town in Yoroido to the big city to become a geisha. However, Chiyo misses her family, and an older geisha is determined to destroy her. One day, a man notices Chiyo crying in the streets, inspiring Chiyo to become Sayuri, a remarkable geisha. Will Sayuri have a happy ending?

Memoirs of a Geisha is this month‚Äôs May Readalong, and I have mixed feelings about this book. First, the pace is really slow. Usually, this is a detriment, but it is perfect for reading this over a month and having in-depth discussions. 

The most enjoyable part of the book is the gamesmanship between the warring geisha, Mameha and Sayuri against Hatsumomo. Mameha knows how to perfectly extract herself from situations gracefully, and she is a true chess player, always thinking a few steps ahead.

I also enjoyed learning more about geisha. The women are entertainers, skilled in conversation, singing, dancing, and playing a musical instrument called the samisen. There are also certain hairstyles and clothing indicating different stages in the life of a geisha. 

Now for the bad‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Memoirs of a Geisha has one of the most disappointing endings. It doesn‚Äôt even make sense, and for dragging on for ages, the ending is extremely rushed. 

At the end of the book, I have more questions than when I started. Each of the geisha could have had their own book, and I felt that some of the characters were left a bit unfinished such as Sayuri‚Äôs sister. 

And for the really bad‚Ä¶.

I wanted to know if Memoirs of a Geisha was based on a true story. In the acknowledgements, Arthur Golden thanks Mineko Iwasaki, who is a real geisha. However, Iwasaki spoke to Golden on the condition of anonymity. She alleges that the book is her life‚Äôs story except that Golden falsely sexualized the book. Two years later, an out-of-court settlement was reached.

Overall, this book is great for discussion, but it made me feel sick. Thank to everyone who participated in the Readalong! See you in June for Little Women!

369,Margaret M - (Working Away - limited time with lots to catch up already,Wuthering Heights,"Nov 09, 2022",5,"5 tormenting and passionate stars for a reading experience like no other, because never have I read a book that altered my emotions so many times in one book. My feelings moved in waves between compassion and despair, admiration and loathing, pity but always regret. Victims or tormentors ‚Äì that‚Äôs for you to decide.

For me, Wuthering Heights is an epic and timeless classic that has everything; obsession, greed, revenge, grief, emotional abuse, inequality, and even light horror. Everything except the thing most associated with this story. In my opinion, this is not a love story ‚Äì it is the most beautiful love story that never happened, and in that lies the tragedy and the power of this book.

It is a sobering waste of life and love, as the cruelty and selfishness of the characters shape their own story against the rigidity of an intolerant class system that pretty much predestined their fate anyway. Yet the unbreakable bond that existed between the two main characters sees them pursue each other ‚Äì but always when it was too late, with the haunting realisation that this self-destruction is set to continue into the next generation as the sins of the parents threaten to live on through the children with the same cruelty and brutality they heaped on each other.

A brutal yet passionate story. A story about love, desire, and obsession but with ugly consequences, made all the more intense for its Victorian England setting. 

In fact, Victorian realism at its best. Raw, rigid, unforgiving, and profoundly devastating. 

The plot

Heathcliff becomes part of the family as Thrushcross Grange, when Mr Earnshaw takes the orphaned boy home to be part of the family. Accepted by Cathy, but bullied by Hindley, Heathcliff‚Äôs early start in life is sad and pitiful. Contrast that to the man who becomes obsessed with Cathy, and whose life is turned upside down when the teenage Cathy ultimately chooses wealth over love and marries Linton.

Overhearing a conversation where Cathy admits that Heathcliff will never be a man of means, he flees the Grange and only returning when he has acquired a fortune. What he didn‚Äôt hear from the last part of the conversation was Cathy professing her unwavering love for Heathcliff with the iconic words ‚ÄòI am Heathcliff‚Äô, and later ‚ÄòI cannot live without my life. I cannot love without my soul‚Äô, despite now being married to someone else. A haunting tale as the flawed decisions and their self-destructive nature dam the lives and outcomes of these soulmates.

However, in an act of revenge Heathcliff marries Cathy‚Äôs sister-in-law, Isabella, and fathers the son who is then to meet Cathy‚Äôs daughter in the second half of the book. Hope or hopelessness?

Review and Comments

Not all stories have to be cheerful with happy endings ‚Äì after all that‚Äôs life, but it is how we respond to those that defines us. This brings me straight to the characterisation in the book, which is absolutely superb. Whether you like or loathe these characters, there is no doubt they were brilliantly cast. In fact, as a character study not one of the characters can elicit a single ounce of admiration from its readers, with the exception of the young Cathy and Hareton. Yet they all make tremendous book characters. 

The writing style is perfect for the storyline and even the dull palette colours depicting the moors and weather reflects the mood of the book and sense of forlorn and hopelessness, as does Wuthering Heights itself. A place naked to the elements, with surroundings that are untamed and raw that mirror the characters central to the story. 

A Love story? ‚Äì Although romantism has a powerful influence on the story, this is not a love story. Instead, it is a powerful story of love and unity of two souls, in life and in death. The iconic words will resonate with many, ""I am Heathcliff"", as Cathy explains .. ""because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same"". Those words get me in the feelers every time. Powerful and heartbreaking.

From the outset and throughout, I was invested in this story, the writing and particularly with the characters as you feel this connected sense of cruelty, self-destruction, and mourning for the countless memories and happiness for the life and love that could have been - but never was. Yet as a reader we are left with guarded optimism for the future of the young Cathy and Heathcliff, or are they too caught in this perpetual cycle of self-destruction, like their parents.

The writing in these classics is not for everyone, and I confess to struggling with it at school. If you can embrace this writing style, then you will love it. In fact, I just finished a mainstream thriller and I turned to my husband and said 'now I really do need a fix from the classics'. If I had one niggle, I don‚Äôt like authors writing in local dialect that is too cryptic. For example ‚Äúaut ne‚Äôink‚Äù meaning ‚Äúought not think‚Äù. For me personally it disrupts the flow of the story, spoils the beautiful writing in these classics but brings little to it. Back to the book.

A painful drama and an unapologetic portrayal of the flawed and imperfect human mind and heart. Dark, chilling and so vividly depicted. Beautifully written but not a beautiful story. A book where love, grief, and betrayal fuel cruelty and revenge. 

Heart-breaking, savage, and self-destructive. Nevertheless, a masterpiece, particularly in its characterisation and the character development."
370,s.penkevich,Pride and Prejudice ,"Sep 24, 2011",4,"‚ÄòIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife,‚Äô begins Jane Austen‚Äôs Pride and Prejudice, an opening sentence nearly as famous as the novel itself. Austen‚Äôs comedy of manners has taken on an immortality, being a title frequently represented in art, knick knacks or decor for book lovers. I mean, this is a book that has tshirts for it as recognizable as a Pink Floyd shirt and if there were a Mt. Rushmore for white people popular classics this would be one of the first to be carved into the rock. Luckily for readers everywhere, it is a book that truly deserves such status and is eminently readable and enjoyable to this day. Pride and Prejudice is sharp, humorous and picturesquely romantic with a cast of characters that practically walk off the page, shake your hand and intermingle in your life as Austen dives into criticisms of class and conventions.

‚ÄòI could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.‚Äô

Of the many reasons Pride and Prejudice has captured hearts for generations, Austen‚Äôs heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, is the most endearing of them. A woman with a great wit and cutting dialogue, she is not without her flaws and hubris which makes her feel so authentic and approachable. The dynamic between Elizabeth and Darcy is a perfectly balanced power struggle of personal judgements as they attempt to maintain individuality under social pressures and obdurate conventions, each stradling a position of both protagonist and antagonist. And antagonize each other they do! Though in the end they come to each other with equal scars and blame. Elizabeth‚Äôs belief in her ability to judge others leads her to misjudge‚Äîa trait not unlike Emma Woodhouse of Emma who‚Äôs pride in her own wit obscured what was right before her‚Äîoverlooking the blatant flaws of Wickham simply over his adversarial role towards Darcy, and coming too harshly to conclusions on Darcy before knowing him better. It should be with no surprise to learn that Austen originally intended to title the novel ‚ÄòFirst Impressions‚Äô.
 ‚ÄòFrom the very beginning‚Äî from the first moment, I may almost say‚Äî of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.‚Äô
We see Elizabeth working on herself internally while also working on the external social factors. ‚ÄòThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others,‚Äô Elizabeth confesses, ‚Äòmy courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.‚Äô Her pride makes her malign others, assuming Miss darcy, for instance, to be a ‚Äòproud, reserved, disagreeable girl‚Äô only to find she is ‚Äòamiable and unpretending.‚Äô It is her intelligence I find most charming, and while she may misjudge, she has the emotional intelligence to self-diagnose and course correct. 

Darcy, on the other hand, must overcome his own pride and snobbery. His disdain for those who work a trade, for instance, is part of a larger depiction of those held in high esteem of class being crude and cruel and a predominant theme in the novel. Caroline, Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine are among those who operate like an extension of class hierarchy, allowing their ideas of social position to guide their thoughts and actions and making them feel immune to criticism. Darcy and Elizabeth lowering their guard, looking at the individual instead of at their social circle/status, and coming to a mutual understanding gives the novel a tender nature, one that asks for empathy and understanding in the world and warns against holding on to judgements too tightly. 

‚ÄòVanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.‚Äô

Another aspect of the novel that really resonates is just how visual it is. Austen has a gift for description and this quality has lent itself to many visually stunning film adaptations. Austen excels at embedding much of her social commentary into her depictions of settings and characters, such as Elizabeth‚Äôs first visit to Darcy‚Äôs house, with ‚Äòhigh woody hills‚Äô and a large, tall garden surrounding a the house, ‚Äòa stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.‚Äô This is a major insight into Darcy as a character: a man without artifice and full of ‚Äònatural beauty‚Äô that he keeps hidden from view. His arrogance is merely his grandiose garden that obscures the him beneath the exterior. Similarly, judgements on character are often made in dialogue that focuses on aspects of dress or decor. ‚ÄòBy describing a material object,‚Äô Roland Barthes writes in The Language of Fashion, ‚Äòif it is not to construct it or to use it, we are led to link the qualities of its matter to a second meaning.‚Äô The criticisms of taste are, in this regard, a criticism of character, so when Caroline and Louisa talk at length about the mud on Elizabeth‚Äôs petticoat, we can infer they are telling us they find her herself to be wild, unkempt and unruly. It is in ways such as these that Austen can make such keen observations that don't announce themselves yet amalgamate to portray a life-like impression of a society that thrives on gossip and social interactions that are plotted like chess pieces moving across the board.

‚ÄòI must learn to be content with being happier than I deserve.‚Äô

Austen‚Äôs Pride and Prejudice drifts at the pace of life, enrapturing you in its lush language, vibrant landscapes, dancing with you through the great halls of ornate homes and giving you an introduction to the high society of the times. This is an eternally charming novel that bites with sharp satire and humor while letting deep lessons and emotional bubble up from tender moments and brilliant insights. It is quite funny at times as well. Jane Austen is remembered for a reason, and while I still favor Emma to be my favorite, this comedy of manners is certainly a Must Read.

4.5/5

‚ÄòWhat do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.‚Äô"
371,Piyangie,Les Mis√©rables,"Nov 30, 2019",5,"This is one of the most beautiful and best books that is ever written about human suffering; a true masterpiece. It is no exaggeration on my part to say so, and those who have read and liked it would agree with me. I have seen the musical and a miniseries, but the book surpasses them all. In my opinion, nothing can be compared with the book. Reading this was such a rewarding experience.
 
While many areas including politics, progress, religion, morals are discussed in this lengthy work, the story as we all know is the story of Jean Val Jean, a victim of human injustice. Val Jean is an unorthodox hero ‚Äì a social outcast. Through his story, Hugo brings to life the immense suffering the underprivileged class goes through. This is the central theme of the story. The physical suffering, the mental agonies, the moral dilemmas the people of this class go through are heartbreaking. Poverty, lack of education, ignorance, and negligence of the rulers have heavily contributed to the dreary lives and living conditions of this deprived class. Hugo penetrates deep into their lives and captures their misery sincerely and sympathetically. His compassion for them flows through his heart-touching writing. 

The background to the story runs from the eve of the battle of Waterloo to the Paris insurgency of June 1833. Hugo presents an account of these turning points of French history to the readers while entwining his story well with it. The chosen background in which the story is set gives Hugo the freedom to freely express his political and social perspective. 

Jean Val Jean, Fantine, and Cosette are the main characters Hugo creates to portray human suffering. Hugo covers all classes with them. There are other minor characters too, but these three characters stand out in the story for the unaccountable miseries they go through. Jean Val Jean, as was said above, is the hero. He is constantly persecuted by society and by the law. The early encounter with the bishop Bienvenu helps him to replace his hatred with love; love for the god and mankind. He starts a new life and becomes successful, and remembering the kindness and guidance of the Bishop, he becomes generous and benevolent. Society reaps all the benefits and law respects him, only till his identity is revealed. When his identity is exposed, both law and society become his pursuers, feigning a blind eye to his virtues. This cruelty is shocking and heartbreaking. The despair he goes through of being a social outcast all his life no matter how reformed and close to god he has become is strongly portrayed. Hugo accuses the society of its cruelty, condemns their actions, and shows that despite the stones cast at Val Jean, his faith in God and his righteousness are never impaired. He suffers, yet forgives and loves. Hugo brings out a Christ-like hero in him. 

One shouldn‚Äôt, however, think that  Les Mis√©rables  is only about misery and suffering. There is also love and happiness. There is fatherly love between Val Jean and Cosette, and love and perfect bliss between Cosette and Marius. These happy relations pour sunshine to the story amidst the heavy, dark clouds. 

Hugo‚Äôs writing is beautifully descriptive, poetic, passionate, dramatic and emotion arousing. I cannot recall a book that broke my heart as much as this book did. There were many moments that I truly cried. And there were certain parts which were too painful to read. These include two heart-stricken moments, one concerning Val Jean when he revealed his true identity at Champmathieu's case and to Marius, and the other is when the insurgency is described where many innocent and youthful lives were lost fighting for an idealogy. 

The book has been criticized for its too detailed historical accounts. Perhaps they are too detailed, but for my part, I found them informative and helpful to fully understand the backdrop in which the story is written. 

The story, apart from the historical details, was emotionally exhausting, but at the same time rewarding. I loved the read, although it mercilessly broke my heart. Thank you, Hugo, for leaving with us such a remarkable and unique literary treasure."
372,Heather,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,"Feb 28, 2009",2,"This is a weird one. The more I read the more I'm okay with the weirdness. Does that say something about me? I thought at first I wouldn't read it to my kids because it's too strange, but I'm thinking now I might. They just might like it. We'll see how it ends. Am I lame that I've never read this before? 

Okay, done with them both. Alice in Wonderland was okay. Still weird. Weird and I didn't understand it. Through the Looking Glass took weird to a whole new level. A bad level. The whole time I was reading it I was thinking, ""Is Carroll on crack? This makes no sense."" And then I thought maybe I needed to be on crack to understand it. I've had crazy dreams sort of like this, all disjointed and random and all, but that doesn't mean I want to read a book about psycho dreams. And what's up with shaking the poor kitten all the time? 

I might read Wonderland to the kids. I won't read Through the Looking Glass.

And does anyone really know what this all means? Because if it's ""just for fun"", it wasn't."

-p.155

The Help spins the tales of women of color who worked as housekeepers in Louisiana in the early 1960‚Äôs, as told to Skeeter who will chronicle their stories and publish them anonymously in one volume. Her naivet√© is shattered when she realizes the back-breaking labor these women do and some of the conditions with which they must endure to make ends meet. The way she looks at her family and friends will forever be changed as she embarks on this project.


I shake my head at my friend. ‚ÄúNot only is they lines, but you know good as I do where them lines be drawn.‚Äù
Aibileen shakes her head. ‚ÄúI used to believe in em. I don‚Äôt anymore. They in our heads. People like Miss Hilly is always trying to make us believe they there. But they ain‚Äôt.‚Äù
-p.312

The audience perspective is not limited to the outsider looking in with Skeeter; Aibileen and Minny provide much needed commentary on what their lives and jobs are like. It‚Äôs an important bit of storytelling to show their sides and tell their stories. Though, as a reader, I would have loved to see Constantine‚Äôs version of the events as well.

The main antagonist, Hilly, is bored and power-hungry. She is a sweetly manipulative queen bee whose peers are outgrowing their need to be cajoled into doing her bidding. That time of her life is well behind her so she decides to use pseudo science and arm-twisting to retain her delusion of social status by trying to convince everyone that they need a separate bathroom for their colored help. She ends up talking so much shit that she ends up having to eat her words‚Ä¶

The Help is entertaining if not languidly paced. I was left wanting more‚Äîmore of the story, more of these women‚Äôs lives, and more of Minny‚Äôs tale of revenge upon a certain housewife."

This was a short book that carried a big punch. Although it is often labeled as a children‚Äôs story, it is so full of beautiful symbolism. The Little Prince is worth reading once a year.

My favorite tale from The Little Prince‚Äôs travel is the story of the businessman. The businessman is busy counting the stars, claiming to own them because he first discovered them. The Little Prince asks him what he does with the stars, and the businessman says nothing. 

‚ÄúI own a flower myself,‚Äù he (The Little Prince) continued, ‚Äúwhich I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I rake out every week. I even rake out the extinct one. You never know. So it‚Äôs of some use to my volcanoes, and it‚Äôs useful to my flower, that I own them. But you‚Äôre not useful to the stars.‚Äù 

There was another quote that I just loved: ‚ÄúI need to put up with two or three caterpillars if I want to get to know the butterflies.‚Äù

376,Nandakishore Mridula,The Chronicles of Narnia,"Mar 17, 2016",3,"Quick review


Terrific fantasy setting and storyline spoilt by extremely unsubtle allegory and (as the story progresses) excessive Christian preachiness. Warning: Racial stereotypes abound and may offend.

Recommended for adults who thrive in a Christian religious environment or those who can overlook these aspects totally and enjoy the story. Not for gullible children, unless accompanied by a discerning adult.


Detailed review


I won't insult the intelligence of respected GoodReaders by giving a synopsis of the Narnia stories - I don't think there will be many here who do not know this story, even if you have not actually read the books. The stories of the four Pevensie children who discover the magical land of Narnia through the back of a wardrobe is the stuff of legend in literary circles - a land which they rule over as kings and queens after freeing it from the enchantment of the White Witch, under the benign yet firm supervision of Aslan the lion.

As fantasies for children go, this is a terrific universe filled with possibilities. There are talking animals, magical creatures from Greek mythology and English fairy-lore, and suitably satisfying and mysterious landscape worthy of exploration again and again. So one feels that if only the author in C. S. Lewis had let himself go he could have produced something similar to the The Lord of the Rings. 

Unfortunately, he does not do that. The author sublimates himself to the Christian, so that the story becomes allegory - and mostly allegory. The spirit of gung-ho adventure is coated over with sickly-sweet preachiness which becomes so cloying towards the end that one almost feels like throwing up.

***

This book contains the novels in the chronological order as regards the story:

1. The Magician's Nephew
2. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
3. The Horse and His Boy
4. Prince Caspian
5. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
6. The Silver Chair
7. The Last Battle

However, the actual order in which the books were published is:

1. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
2. Prince Caspian
3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
4. The Silver Chair
5. The Magician's Nephew
6. The Horse and His Boy
7. The Last Battle

It seems that there is a hot dispute going on about the order in which the books should be read. After reading them in the chronological sequence, I would advise reading them in the sequence of publication. IMO, the last two - The Horse and His Boy, and The Last Battle - are better left unread, especially the last one. More about that later.

Aslan the Lion is Christ - this becomes evident in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe itself (view spoiler)[(he sacrifices himself to save Edmund Pevensie, and is immediately resurrected) (hide spoiler)]. The White Witch (and later, the Queen of the Underworld) are embodiments of Evil with a capital E. 

(I was a bit surprised that there was no sign of the gentleman with the horns and the forked tail. Evil is entirely feminine - that too, with a perverse sort of sexual attractiveness. It seems Lewis was genuinely frightened of woman's sexuality: Susan becomes a ""non-friend of Narnia"" the moment she becomes a nubile young woman. Lewis's protagonists, like that of Lewis Carroll, are prepubescent girls.)

The Christian world view is evident from the word go - for example, the animals and birds can all be killed and eaten, provided that they are not ""talking animals""! (They have been specially blessed as such by Aslan, we are told, in the story of the creation of Narnia in The Magician's Nephew.) This evidently comes from the Bible where Man is given dominion over every living thing on earth. In case we don't get it, Aslan continuously addresses the boys as ""Sons of Adam"" and the girls as ""Daughters of Eve"" and says that only they can rule over Narnia. As the story progresses, it becomes more prevalent - and now racism and intolerance of the heathens also come into play.

The Calormenes - dark-skinned foreigners who worship a savage god Tash, wear turbans and carry scimitar-like swords - are an Englishman's fantasy of the bloodthirsty and lecherous Turk. In their country, young girls are routinely married off to old codgers, and they wage war on the free countries like Narnia to rape and pillage. Their God Tash, however, is a pagan deity who is loosely associated with the gentleman I mentioned earlier - the guy with horns.

The unlikeable brat Eustace Scrubb is the son of liberal parents who are pacifists and vegetarians. He studies in a school which does not have corporal punishment and which does not teach the Bible - and is therefore full of bullies who are encouraged by the Principal! However, Eustace reforms after a visit to Narnia, and returns back to the school and hammers the living daylights out of the bullies. The Principal is removed from the school and ultimately becomes a Member of Parliament, where she lives happily ever after (note the point: M. P. 's are failed schoolteachers who fail to put the fear of God into children).

It is in the last book that Lewis outdoes himself. There is an ape who presents a donkey as Aslan. The ape is part of a conspiracy with the Caloremenes who present their God Tash and Aslan as the same, but don't believe in either. (view spoiler)[In an Armageddon of sorts, Narnia is destroyed, Tash eats up his worshippers, and the dwarves who believe in neither are confined in a dark stable of their own creation (the fate of atheists?) (hide spoiler)]. Also, the ending is patently silly (view spoiler)[(all the friends of Narnia being killed in a train accident so that they can inhabit Aslan's timeless paradise) (hide spoiler)] and for me, it was disgusting.

Then why the three stars?

Well, if you can ignore the allegory and the preachiness, there are some pretty interesting adventures here. The first three books are rather well-written (although a bit simplistic) and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is your classic sea adventure. The Magician's Nephew is extremely funny in parts. One advise to prospective readers though - please give the last book a miss."
377,Marquise,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Jul 07, 2023",5,"Me: ""What impacted you the most when you read To Kill a Mockingbird?""
Sis: ""Let me think... Probably Atticus, he was a great father to Scout.""
Me: ""Is it just me or does he remind you of our dad too?""
Sis: ""Mmm... oh, yes, definitely.""
Me: ""Do you remember that anecdote of me coming back crying from school because the boys had bullied me for not looking like them, and he sat me down to explain all about that? Atticus explaining race to Scout is so like what he told me.""
Sis: ""Haha, yeah, he did things like that with me too. I was so nosy and asked him so many questions!""
Me: ""Do you think he would've seen himself in Atticus Finch if he had read this book?""
Sis: nostalgic sigh ""Yeah... But he'd say he would've been stricter with us girls. Not with you, he only threatened you with dire punishment!""

The above is part of a long conversation I had yesterday with one of my sisters, fourteen years my senior and with more memories of our father than I, because I needed to make sure I wasn't imagining things and it wasn't the rosy glasses of nostalgia what was making me see my father in Atticus Finch. She confirmed that, yes, he had been with me like Mr Finch was with Scout, and he had been like Mr Finch with her as well as to the next youngest sister, to all three amongst his daughters who were the closest to him. My father was like Atticus Finch, and taught me all about treating people, not getting into fights with schoolmates, not sneaking into the neighbours' orchards, to be nice to the old ladies, to understand race and never allow others make me feel uncomfortable about mine, to not spy on the ""village idiot,"" to love books, to not touch guns I didn't know how to fire, to fish, swim, care for my little animals and my personal patch at the orchard . . . He was my hero, and the only person that could manage an active, inquisitive, scrapes-prone tomboy with too many questions and opinions for her own good.

I'm not used to seeing anything from my life in a book, I don't think I've ever found anything this relatable in any book, so To Kill a Mockingbird is extremely exceptional in this regard. They say that when you don't know how to review a book, go for what impacted you personally and unroll from there, and this is it for me. My father is no longer alive, but if anyone were to ask me what it was like for me with him, I'd have said it was like the father/daughter relationship in this book.

I could also say that the story itself is beautiful if bittersweet and tragic at times, that the characters are so well-done, that I liked the POV structure of telling the story through a child's eyes, with a child's voice and child's understanding of the world, but with enough mature evocative power that you understand far more than Scout does through the words she repeats without fully grasping the meanings. For example, in the courtroom scene, you are told just enough to understand what Scout doesn't about Mayella Ewell, the white girl who accuses Tom Robinson. It's this kind of understated horror barely buried under the surface that makes the narrative so much more powerful, in my opinion. Scout is so innocent because she's young and has been raised to expect the best from people, but you know there's rotten things in Maycomb. She expects justice with a child's faith, but you know this can't end but in tragedy.

And speaking of tragedy, the only complaint I have is that I believe the fate of Tom Robinson could've been different. The miscarriage of justice should've run its course and ended in the penalty he was sentenced to, to underscore just how deeply flawed and racist the trial had been, instead of having Tom (view spoiler)[die from being shot by guards whilst trying to escape (hide spoiler)], because that somehow makes it look like the ending is Tom's fault. A completely innocent man should've had a completely innocent end instead of giving them an ""excuse,"" so that didn't sit well with me. Although, when I think on it some more, I can see how that ending also does highlight how tremendously unfair the whole case was, just not powerfully enough for me.

In any case, it's the Atticus/Scout dynamics what will always live in my memory from this book. Wish I could talk to my father once again and ask, ""What does Appomattox mean?"" and get a lecture on not reading books for adults without his permission right before I fell asleep on his lap thirty seconds into his long tale about the America in his Westerns."
378,Rhi,The Fault in Our Stars,"Oct 23, 2011",2,"I must be clear from the beginning. This is perhaps the most personal review I have written. My choice of stars was difficult for this. I am a self confessed John Green fan, I believe he is amongst the best of, not only YA, but fiction writers out there in general. 
This is a beautifully written book. There is very little to complain about in terms of style, plot, character, etc. However I couldn't, in all good conscience, give this any higher because it sits so badly with me. I have let this novel marinate for a couple of days now before writing this, and I just keep coming back to the same issues. Namely:

Was this John Green's story to tell?

It is the human condition to attempt to find hope in hopeless situations. But let me attempt to explain how watching a 17 year old fade away truly feels. Because when the wit and words are stripped away I am not sure John did that.

It is endless. It is an unavoidable and uncontrollable and an all encompassing darkness where no hope or life or explanations exist.

There are absolutely no life lessons to be gained from watching a 17 year old cease to exist. There is no comfort. The lessons that some may claim you can achieve through the darkest night of the soul reveal most of humanity for the selfish, narcissistic beings we are.

I have come to believe there is a special kind of cruelty behind the perfectly cross stitched 'encouragement'. Those things are for the ones left over trying to make sense of the senseless.

Whilst I believe this novel acknowledges that. It tries not to, as the main protagonists claimed theirselves, set the victims of disease up as typical heroic, worldly wise characters, it still reads like a novel attempting to bring equilibrium out of disaster. The victims ultimately still are wise beyond their years. This, it seems, is an assumed side effect of a teenager coming to terms with their mortality. They use metaphors and pretentious poetry and a sharp wit and are wholly unbelievable as real life teenagers. They are constructs of an ideal. They are the literary version of Dawson's Creek, using SAT vocabulary and existential navel gazing, whilst simultaneously slamming the typical genre for using its characters to do the same.

Having lived this first hand; once with a brother who ceases to exist at 17 and a second time with a brother who is currently 2 years NEC. I am all too familiar with the need for light hearted humour at what may feel like the most inappropriate of times. But what differs from that and attempting to write a disease ridden novel that attempts to make you laugh, is apparently personal experience. 

I have the right to sit around a Christmas table laughing somewhat hysterically at nothing. My living brother has the right to crack UNO-ball jokes whenever the opportunity arises. But none of the readers of this novel who have not experienced the kind of loss depicted here have a right to laugh at any of it. You can not claim it as your own unless it is yours, and in my mind that is what humour does. It is not appropriate for me to laugh along with eye jokes and blind jokes, because they are not my jokes. I am merely a voyeur in another persons tragedy, I lay no claim to having the understanding of the experience necessary to allow for laughter.

Again, let me make clear. I can not approach this book outside of my personal experience. Of course in reality I do not believe you have to have experienced everything to laugh at a joke. But in terms of purposefully trying to create humour in a novel that is fundamentally tragic, for an audience that is mostly YA, I struggle with. I struggle with it because the empty platitudes that are trying so hard to be subverted in this novel, are still being created. It is still suggesting there can be lightness and humour within the terminally dark - and it is suggesting it to people who have never experienced the terminally dark.

This read like a novel where the author has truly witnessed the emptiness of teenage terminal illness, and thankfully appears to have become more considerate and thoughtful for it. As opposed to erring on the side of platitudes.
But it still read as a novel attempting to explain where the hope in hopeless situations are.

Perhaps because it is too raw a subject for me, or perhaps because the novel really is sentimental and gratuitous (granted in a different way from the norm of this genre) but this is not a book I would recommend.
For sufferers, for family members of sufferers, or for well meaning people seeking to understand the hopelessness of some situations. I would recommend it for none."
379,Geoff,Crime and Punishment,"Feb 21, 2008",5,I basically had to stop drinking for a month in order to read it; my friends no longer call. But it's great.
380,K.,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Jan 25, 2009",5,"Dec 2013: Rereading with my 2 oldest kids after seeing ""Desolation of Smaug"" (they wanted to read it, the 2nd hasn't read beyond ""Hobbit"" yet, and I wanted to check my memory since I didn't remember things the same way the directors of the movie seemed to ;) Also gave a challenge to them, as in, ""I'll read these with you if you'll read through DICKENS with me, ha ha ha ha""...diabolical but they both accepted...we'll see how it goes. How about it you two??)

Enjoyed ""The Hobbit"" tremendously again. It's amazing, stories, that is. Again and again and again some of them can go round and still delight and enchant. 

I appreciated the little beauties in the writing this time, things like ""like a patch of midnight that had never been cleared up."" And little thoughts like:

""Going on from there was the bravest thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterward were as nothing compared to it. He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait.""

And ""Surely you don't disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself? You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures, and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole benefit?""

On to ""Fellowship."" 

I love these words from Tolkien's introduction: ""Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it boring, absurd, or contemptible, and I have no cause to complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer."" Guffaw. Well said. 

---
(The following review was from my last reading, Jan 2009)

Tolkien did not like religious allegory, (reportedly including his good friend C.S. Lewis's Narnia series) and says in the introduction to ""The Fellowship of the Ring:"" ""I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other to the purposed domination of the author.""

Two of my bookgroup friends chose to co-host these books, with an effort to find the ""applicability."" How fun! 

I have read and absolutely relished these books a number of times, but haven't really put any effort behind understanding rather than just enjoyment. Because I'm a nerd, I found about 20 articles on religious themes, symbolism, applicability etc. by various people on the internet and read those with the books. To say there is more to these books than I previously imagined is a bit of an understatement. 

Studying up a bit on other people's theories on Tolkien's writings was fun, but even more was what could be discerned about Tolkien himself from his letters and writings to friends about his books. I love getting to know an author that way and being able to see little bits of their personality come out in their works (like the fact that Tolkien loved smoking a pipe--does all the pipe smoking in the book make more sense now?)

Tolkien was a man very faithful to his religion and his God. I loved picking out the manifestations in that. Although LoftR is a ""pagan"" story (no religion) it is filled with Christian themes of mercy, free will, divine mission, and hope, individual worth, and salvation.

Our brands of Christianity differ a bit, Tolkien's and mine, and I also found it a good study to see the sameness and differences. Tolkien wrote to a friend once that he saw history as one long disaster and it seemed to me that his faith was more dominated by the idea--you know, ""life is pain, highness,--anyone who says differently is selling something."" Perhaps that comes from the belief in original sin? 

At any rate, I come from a background in which I have come to believe that ""man is that he might have joy."" Pain and suffering are inevitable, but can successfully exist side by side with hope, joy, and even earthly happiness. We aren't called upon to endure anything we can't handle--with God's help. Frodo's end is a bit sad in that light, I believe we can fulfill our missions and yet still enjoy the fruits. 

Anyway, some poet wrote that we are more the same than different, but let's still enjoy our differences. Pure truth. 

I'll sign off with a couple of quotations from the articles I read about how Tolkien came to write these books in case anyone has been ever too turned off from either the movies or the genre to want to read the books. 

---
""Professor J. R. R. Tolkien was grading papers on a summer day in 1928 when he came upon a blank page in an exam book. Something inspired him to scribble a few words: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.' The whole thing might have ended there, but it was only a beginning. 'Names always generate a story in my mind,' he explained later. 'Eventually I thought I'd better find out what hobbits were like.'"" From ""The Truth Beyond Memory, What lies behind the Fellowship"" By John J. Miller 

--
""When The Lord of the Rings first appeared in the 1950s, one of Tolkien's greatest disappointments was that Christian periodicals ignored it. He feared they missed the point that the 500,000-word story was to its very core Catholic. To a Jesuit friend he wrote: 'The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously at first, but consciously in the revision.' When Tolkien began writing it in 1937, he merely wanted it to be a sequel to his clever children's story, The Hobbit. God shocked him, as he later believed, when a dark figure, one of the nine Ringwraiths, suddenly appeared in the story. Tolkien was as surprised at the arrival of a servant of the devil as were his fictional, frightened Hobbits. While meditating on this unexpected arrival, Tolkien seems to have focused upon the Lord's Prayer. 'I think rather of the mysterious last petitions of the Lord's Prayer: Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,' Tolkien wrote in 1956. 'A petition against something that cannot happen is unmeaning. There exists the possibility of being placed in position beyond one's power. In which case (as I believe) salvation from ruin will depend on something apparently unconnected: the general sanctity (and humility and mercy) of the sacrificial person.' Tolkien firmly believed that his characters had existed long before he had, that God had given him the story. He believed he merely recorded it. Ultimately, Tolkien claimed, God was the true author of the Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings."" From ""NOT A HIPPIE CULT FIGURE: The Christian Gifts of J.R.R. Tolkien"" by Bradley J. Birzer"
381,Tom,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"May 12, 2012",5,"My third time to read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I read all the poetry and verse this time. I loved these books. They are so different from the typical fiction of this genre. These were so well written, so well thought through. I love how they teach loyalty, fidelity, duty, and love of things more than self. They connect back to the greatness of the past. One other thing, we see that evil gets nervous also and that it will eventually collapse in on itself. In many pieces that show good and evil, good win almost by luck and by ""tricking"" evil in some way. Good will always win as long as there are good men and women willing to give of self for the better good."
382,emma,Jane Eyre ,"Apr 30, 2015",5,"I am a very pretentious person.

https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...

I try to seem ‚Äúhip‚Äù and ‚Äúcool‚Äù and ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù and ‚Äúdown with the teens‚Äù - and of course I totally am all of those things - but also I have my tendencies toward pretension. It‚Äôs who I am. Just last night I shuddered at the idea of popular music, like some kind of eight-hundred-year-old gremlin.

I am not proud of this side of me, but it‚Äôs who I am. And also it is important background information for you, dear Reader, going into this review. (That direct address to you as an audience member was me emulating this book, not an example of my pretension. Or was it???)

Anyway. It‚Äôs important that you know my capacity to be pretentious so that I can make this statement:

I don‚Äôt get how any reader can say they don‚Äôt like classics.

Oof. A doozy, right? Aren‚Äôt you glad I warned you? Now you know that that wasn‚Äôt just a one-off of self-serious condescension but rather a pattern of my personality and oh sh*t actually my explanation probably made the whole thing a million times worse. Now I‚Äôve painted my insufferability as consistent.

Come back, everyone!!!! Let me explain!

What I need to explain is that this book is excellent, and also a classic. It is very very old but sometimes old stuff is still worth it! (I should know. I have the mannerisms of the type of grumpy old man that gets endearingly profiled in Scandinavian bestsellers.)

This is not the classic I would recommend that someone start with if they‚Äôre looking to get into the genre. It is very, very slow, and very wordy, and the language takes some settling in. But also this book is a literal gem.

It was published in 19th century England, which is no one‚Äôs idea of Progressive Central. But this book is jarringly feminist when the constraints it (and Jane) were working in are taken into account. Jane is an independent woman, and this book from eighteen freakin‚Äô forty-seven tells her story.

Now, I love Jane Austen books as much as the next girl (if the next girl is pretty damn obsessed with Jane Austen), but that‚Äôs something not even all her books can say.

Here‚Äôs the thing about this book: I love nineteenth century fiction (or what I‚Äôve read of it), but even if you didn‚Äôt you‚Äôd probably love this book. So much of this is unique, by the standards of then but also even the standards of today. It‚Äôs a romance, yes, which: extremely normal. But it‚Äôs a romance between two characters who are not conventionally beautiful, which is unbelievably rare. 

It‚Äôs also not a romance that acts as basically the sole option for its female character. I love Pride & Prejudice, and I of course think Lizzie Bennet is a feminist (and awesome) character, but there‚Äôs no way for that book to end, really, that doesn‚Äôt include marriage for her. Three of the five Bennet sisters get married over the course of that book. It‚Äôs either that or old maid status, baby.

But not lil Jane Eyre. She does not allow marriage to be the only prospect for her!! She goes away and makes a life for herself and then decides whether she wants to follow that path. We don‚Äôt even see that in every 21st century romance.

Plus, Jane is an excellent character, and of a type we RARELY see. She‚Äôs serious and upstanding and smart and moral. She has a strong mind and she doesn‚Äôt shy away from that. She lacks the requisite features of today‚Äôs female subjects of romance: the quirkiness or the humor or the adorkable way she trips and falls/spills coffee/etc. She also lacks the nineteenth-century version of a lot of those traits. And it is so goddamn refreshing I can‚Äôt even tell you.

And on top of all that, the language in this book is so gorgeous I want the whole manuscript tattooed on me.

Which would be wild, because this is about a million pages long. And speaking of, yes, it is very slow and hard to get into and basically you have to adjust to a whole new reading experience. So I wouldn‚Äôt recommend starting off your nineteenth century fiction binge with this book.

But I would recommend getting into nineteenth century fiction solely for the purpose of reading this book.

Bottom line: IT‚ÄôS JUST SO DAMN GOOD, YOU GUYS.

hey um...i love this book so stupid much???

if you've got a free few hours over the course of the next few months i HIGHLY recommend rereading this book at a snail's pace. worked out for me very well.

384,Nataliya,Brave New World,"Mar 02, 2012",3,"Brave New World is a classic written to make its readers uncomfortable. It accomplishes its point well. Still, it is only getting 3 stars from me, as I rate books based on my personal level of enjoyment rather than literary value. 

The characters of this book were not meant to be likeable - I am fine with that concept. The first few chapters made me want to curl up in the corner and cry - that's how repulsive the design of this universe was (mission accomplished, Mr. Huxley). But as we plunge into the depths of the neverending moral message of the story (basically the entire last third of the book), I felt my patience stretching thin. I get the message, no need to beat me over the head with it.

I did chuckle at the ridiculous consumerism of this world (inspired by America of the turn of the century) in which, unexpectedly, most characters have distinct socialist names - Lenina, Trotsky, Marx, Bernard (as in G.B.Shaw). I just think it's funny how both of the enemies of Huxley's ideal world - the competing ideologies of socialism and rampant consumerism - were dealt with in one blow. Good try - but come on!

I liked the description of the effects of soma drug on the mind. No wonder, as this was written by the author of The Doors of Perception about mescaline effects on the mind - an interesting read, by the way.

Of the classic trio of dystopian books (this one, Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Zamyatin's We) this one is my least favorite (We is the best, in my opinion, and may have actually inspired this one). Brave New World succeeds at portraying dystopia at its worst and making the reader think, but stilted language and moral heavy-handedness take away from the enjoyment. Yet it's a classic, and should be read, even if not for fun. 3 stars."
385,Chris,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Feb 08, 2008",3,"Revised 28 March 2012

Huh? Oh. Oh, man. Wow.

I just had the  weirdest dream.

There was this little town, right? And everybody had, like, the same two names. And there was this guy who lived under a tree and a lady who ate dirt and some other guy who just made little gold fishes all the time. And sometimes it rained and sometimes it didn‚Äôt, and‚Ä¶ and there were fire ants everywhere, and some girl got carried off into the sky by her laundry‚Ä¶

Wow. That was messed up.

I need some coffee.

The was roughly how I felt after reading this book. This is really the only time I‚Äôve ever read a book and thought, ‚ÄúYou know, this book would be awesome if I were stoned.‚Äù And I don‚Äôt even know if being stoned works on books that way.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez (which is such a fun name to say) is one of those Writers You Should Read. You know the type ‚Äì they‚Äôre the ones that everyone claims to have read, but no one really has. The ones you put in your online dating profile so that people will think you‚Äôre smarter than you really are. You get some kind of intellectual bonus points or something, the kind of highbrow cachet that you just don‚Äôt get from reading someone like Stephen King or Clive Barker.

Marquez was one of the first writers to use ‚Äúmagical realism,‚Äù a style of fantasy wherein the fantastic and the unbelievable are treated as everyday occurrences. While I‚Äôm sure it contributed to the modern genre of urban fantasy ‚Äì which also mixes the fantastic with the real ‚Äì magical realism doesn‚Äôt really go out of its way to point out the weirdness and the bizarrity. These things just happen. A girl floats off into the sky, a man lives far longer than he should, and these things are mentioned in passing as though they were perfectly normal.

In this case, Colonel Aureliano Buendia has seventeen illegitimate sons, all named Aureliano, by seventeen different women, and they all come to his house on the same day. Remedios the Beauty is a girl so beautiful that men just waste away in front of her, but she doesn‚Äôt even notice. The twins Aureliano Segundo and Jose Arcadio Segundo may have, in fact, switched identities when they were children, but no one knows for sure ‚Äì not even them. In the small town of Macondo, weird things happen all the time, and nobody really notices. Or if they do notice that, for example, the town‚Äôs patriarch has been living for the last twenty years tied to a chestnut tree, nobody thinks anything is at all unusual about it.

This, of course, is a great example of Dream Logic ‚Äì the weird seems normal to a dreamer, and you have no reason to question anything that‚Äôs happening around you. Or if you do notice that something is wrong, but no one else seems to be worried about it, then you try to pretend like coming to work dressed only in a pair of spangly stripper briefs and a cowboy hat is perfectly normal.

Another element of dreaminess that pervades this book is that there‚Äôs really no story here, at least not in the way that we have come to expect. Reading this book is kind of like a really weird game of The Sims - it‚Äôs about a family that keeps getting bigger and bigger, and something happens to everybody. So, the narrator moves around from one character to another, giving them their moment for a little while, and then it moves on to someone else, very smoothly and without much fanfare. There‚Äôs very little dialogue, so the story can shift very easily, and it often does.

Each character has their story to tell, but you‚Äôre not allowed to linger for very long on any one of them before Garcia shows you what‚Äôs happening to someone else. The result is one long, continuous narrative about this large and ultimately doomed family, wherein the Buendia family itself is the main character, and the actual family members are secondary to that.

It was certainly an interesting reading experience, but it took a while to get through. I actually kept falling asleep as I read it, which is unusual for me. But perhaps that‚Äôs what Garcia would have wanted to happen. By reading his book, I slipped off into that non-world of dreams and illusions, where the fantastic is commonplace and ice is something your father takes you to discover.

------
‚Äú[Arcadio] imposed obligatory military service for men over eighteen, declared to be public property any animals walking the streets after six in the evening, and made men who were overage wear red armbands. He sequestered Father Nicanor in the parish house under pain of execution and prohibited him from saying mass or ringing the bells unless it was for a Liberal victory. In order that no one would doubt the severity of his aims, he ordered a firing squad organized in the square and had it shoot a scarecrow. At first no one took him seriously.‚Äù"
386,Mer,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Apr 18, 2007",3,"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi...

(Click the above link to read professor Carol Zaleski's interesting take of the seething religious/political furor surrounding these classics.)

I pined for Narnia in the most broken, sad way when I was a little girl. 

Obviously, I had no knowledge of any Christian subtext when I first read ""Da Chroni *WHUT* cles"". I remember devouring them in much the same way that children are now tearing through the Harry Potter series. Lewis's lavish descriptions of fauns and dragons and giants have burned themselves permanently into my memory.

Ten year old Mer's desire to live in that world and shoot arrows and eat Turkish Delight and befriend those magical talking beasts was all-consuming. Most of all, I wanted to know Aslan. To be cuddled and loved by that big, fierce, lovable lion. But in the end, I had to let go of him and his realm. (I remember being so disconsolate, in fact, that my parents let me stay home from school for a day! And they NEVER let me play hookey! So weird, remembering that.)

There were just so many aspects of that world that made me feel, well, BAD, somehow. Guilty, or ashamed, or just plain uncomfortable. 

Remember when Susan didn't come back, basically because she discovered her sexuality?

Remember the Calormenes? Those dark-skinned people with really intense garlic breath who wore turbans and worshiped a Satanic ""false god"" who demanded blood sacrifices from his followers?

There was SO much blame being laid out in that world. A lot of finger-pointing and shaming going on, a lot of damning and excluding. It was all very black and white, us or them, good or evil.

In the end, I rejected the Narnia books for that reason. Later, finding out Lewis was a devout Christian and Aslan was basically supposed to be Jebus in a lion suit, I wasn't at all surprised.

Nowadays, I recommend Miyazaki movies (especially Kiki) to every tween girl I meet to cleanse their palate of some of the more despicable Disney depictions of femininity, and I happily gift kids (and adults!) with the Dark Materials trilogy to counteract their exposure to the Narnia dogma.

All that being said, these books are a memorable part of my childhood, and I still recall parts of them with fondness and longing."

389,Nilufer Ozmekik,The Catcher in the Rye,"Feb 06, 2018",4,"‚ÄúCatcher in the rye‚Äù is one of most debatable, argumentative, complex novels of the century. 

Some people think it‚Äôs a masterpiece: great approach of corruption, phoniness of people‚Äôs characteristics which is reflected by the perspective of Holden Caulfield who feels and sees so much for his young age. 

And some of the other reviewers think this book is incredibly boring and Holden is such a sassy, arrogant, pretentious little bastard who has no idea about real life, its challenges, struggles without any proper experiences you may only have when you get aged and connect with people without thinking their phony, fake or artificial. 

In my opinion, if you read this book at several different time lines of your lives, you get different impressions, taste and your undeniably hate to the character may turn into empathy or understanding because I can honestly say every person in his/ her own life has a Holden phase: you start criticizing the people who lost their innocence long time ago by building mandatory, insincere relationships. 

You feel like you‚Äôre alone in the crowd, walking alone in the dark, keep screaming but no sound comes out. This book is not only about a teenage, know it all, irritating boy‚Äôs silent scream, it‚Äôs our own challenge to face how to be grown up, how to wear our new aged characteristics like wearing a two sized bigger human coat. 

As soon as you catch your inner Holden during your read, his words will start to talk directly to your soul and heart at the same time. 

I personally read this book four times. At first time it was for my school work and as you may imagine I hate the guts of the character but second reading of mine was completely different. I felt like I was the one talking through character‚Äôs mouth. 

I read it for third time for few years back for my book club ( they threw me out because I started to read 6 books instead of 1 weekly and gave so much spoiler!) and today I chose it as my flashback Saturday read for fourth time reading! 

It‚Äôs still quite remarkable coming of age novel about teenage angst, innocence, loneliness, growing pains. It always awaken different feelings you have no idea they exist. But as I say before, don‚Äôt read this book only one time. Just give it a chance, try several times at different phases of your life. And don‚Äôt you dare to kill your inner Holden! Sometimes being rebellious is better than being obedient without questioning anything further.

Here are my favorite quotes of the book: 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a sad good-bye or a bad good-bye, but when I leave a place I like to know I‚Äôm leaving it. If you don‚Äôt, you feel even worse.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. Nobody‚Äôd move. You could go there a hundred thousand times, and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish, the birds would still be on their way south, the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole‚Ä¶ Nobody‚Äôd be different‚Ä¶ The only thing that would be different would be you.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople always clap for the wrong reasons.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy.‚Äù"

392,C.,Twilight ,"Nov 21, 2007",3,"I actually had to give this book three separate reviews by three sides of my personality. My three-star rating is the median of the three:

Review 1, by My Inner Fifteen Year Old Girl (5 stars):
Bella is smart, funny, well-read, pretty and yet misunderstood by most of her peers (just like me). Then she meets a cool, hot guy who turns out to be a good vampire, and he can do really cool things, like run fast and stop cars with his hands, but he's still sweet and wonderful. It's ultimate wish-fulfillment fantasy -- what's not to like? Meyers can make your heart speed up with some of the tense, tortured ""we must be together/no, what if i hurt you"" pg-13 erotica.

Review 2, by My Fan of YA Lit (3 Stars):
Meyers can tell a pretty good story, when she lets herself actually tell it -- the book starts out well, and would have been a bit more interesting if I hadn't known he was a vampire all along. Then it slows down during the long ""getting to know you"" dialogue exchanges between Edward and Bella -- there's no plot, just back-story and exposition disguised as conversations, and far too many ""I can't be with you, I don't want to hurt you!"" ""But I love you, I don't care about danger!"" back-and-forths. When the evil vamps show up, however, the story kicks back in and the end is quite exciting. When Meyers isn't dwelling on how perfectly angelic Edward is (again!) she can get the pages turning. Since there are A LOT of pages to turn, I wish she would have infused that urgency into the story more often. While abandoning most of the conventional cliches of vampire-lore (stakes, sunlight, garlic, coffins) she keeps all the modern-vamp-romance cliches (alabaster skin, good hair, expensive taste in clothes, tragically distant), and adds a few of her own unfortunate twists (vampires avoid the sun because it makes them sparkle, the good-vamp clan play some extreme version of baseball in a scene that was far too Quidich-y for my taste). Too many cliches or trying to hard to be original -- somehow both criticisms are accurate.

Review 3, by My Inner Feminist (1 Star):
Meyers describes Bella as being strong, brave, and independent, but then shows her as a spineless, cowering victim who needs to be saved by her violently jealous and over-protective boyfriend. She constantly goes on and on about how Edward is perfect at everything and how he's so gorgeous and she is so unworthy of him, how he's so strong and he protects her. In fact, she never gives any reason for liking him other than how hot he is, but that's fair because Edward never gives a reason for liking her other than she smells good. He is frustrated that Bella is the only person whose thoughts he can't read, so he eavesdrops on her friends minds to find out what they talk about, he follows her whenever she leaves her house, and he secretly camps outside her room when she sleeps - that doesn't sound sweet, it sounds creepy. If girls want a romantic, conflicted vampire/human romance, they should go watch the firs three seasons of Buffy -- not only is there the dark, mysterious, conflicted vampire, but the girl he's in love with can kick some serious ass all on her own."

*swoons*



First, we need to clear something up. Colin Firth is the only Mr. Darcy.
That other Mr. Darcy was horrible! No, no, no, no, nooooo!
Make it stop. Make. It. Stop. 
 


So, quite obviously, the BBC miniseries (in all its 327 minute glory) is the only version that is acceptable. The other movie was such a travesty to this book, that I wept big, fat, angry tears...like the spoiled brat that I am. 
Or maybe I'm exaggerating slightly. 
What were they thinking?! You don't mess with perfection!
What did you think, Elizabeth?



Exactly.

I'm kidding. Sort of.

Anyway, instead of reading it this time around, I listened to an audiobook version. Apparently, which audio version you listen to makes a difference.
My real-life BFF said her version had an American 
doing British accents
 and she found it terribly annoying. I, however, had a version with an actual lady from the land of tea 'n crumpets, and she did a fine job. Well, she did have this lounge singerish voice, so instead of sounding like a fresh-faced 20 year old, Elizabeth sounded like she had been smoking 3 packs a day for about 40 years.
Eh, I was ok with it. I kept imagining Lizzie with a cigarette dangling from her lips like a truck stop hooker, and it gave the story a fresh perspective.



I've read this so many times over the years that I've lost count, but I still wish I could go back and read it for the first time all over again. 
I hated that stupid, arrogant, arse-faced Mr. Darcy when he first showed up at the ball. Ugh. What a prick!
So, just like Lizzie, I remember being shocked at his proposal. And just like Lizzie, I was horrified by the way he dissed her family while he did it!
And how could he think she would ever agree to marry him after the way he convinced Bingley that Jane didn't love him?! 
And the way he treated poor Wickham!
Just who did this guy think he was! 



But then...The Letter!
Oh, my! Well, that certainly put a different spin on things didn't it?!
Elizabeth & I were so ashamed that we had judged him so harshly.
*hangs head*
And the way he acted toward us when we met near the lake!
So kind...such a gentleman!

 

Ok, I've probably read that particular scene (at Pemberley) a million times. Sometimes, I would just pick up and start the book from there. 
Total comfort food.
It's just...ahhhhhhhhhhh.

Of course, Lydia has to go and ruin everything! How could she be such a stupid, selfish, uncaring twat!? Grrrrrrr!
*strangle, strangle, strangle*



How will Darcy and I...I mean, Darcy and Elizabeth...manage to get their Happily Ever After?
Feelings! Oh, the feelings!

 

So. Yes, I'm unashamed to admit that I am that clich√© of a woman who loves Pride and Prejudice. Unashamed! 
I just...{insert fangirl screaming and crying}

395,Todd,The Secret Garden,"Aug 22, 2007",5,"I know this book seems out of place among the fare I usually read, but hey, all I can say is that I like what I like. There is some intangible quality to this book that really strikes a chord in me. The whole idea of that sickly child being healed with love, attention, and (forgive me an LDS joke) wholesome recreational activities, just somehow speaks Truth to me. I think this book has strong application to today's problems with the rising generation. I really believe that kids these days are getting fatter, less healthy, and less disciplined. I think that a good romp on the heather and a breath of fresh air would do kids a lot of good.

On another level, I really believe that some people are only as sick as they think they are. Working in the healthcare field, it's obvious to me that some people find it quite easy to take the role of a victim. Again, this book speaks Truth concerning the value of attitude and perspective in overcoming perceived problems and finding out that they weren't as bad as you thought they were."

 - Cherokee legend
 
I have to start by saying Holy cats! That was not what I was expecting. 
 
This fabulous tale begins with bumbling Mr. Lockwood, who wishes to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and looks forward to the beautiful country life. He‚Äôs on a mission to rent Thrushcross Grange from its owner, who also owns Wuthering Heights Manor. He‚Äôs welcomed as much as anyone would welcome the plague and is met with harsh treatment, as well as pack of ill-tempered dogs who violently maul him. Add to that a snowstorm that puts him in his sickbed, this rural getaway is beginning to seem like a capital idea! 
 
As Mr. Lockwood convalesces at Thrushcross Grange, he becomes acquainted with the keeper of the house, Ellen Dean. Treading lightly after his previous encounters with these inhospitable people he approaches Miss Dean with caution and inquires after the intriguing inhabitants of Wuthering Heights. Ellen - or Nelly, as she‚Äôs known- is of a kinder disposition. She rushes off to get her knitting and settles in to tell the tale of all of the broken souls who haunt the halls of these once-grand homes.

I‚Äôm snuggled in with my new friends engrossed in the saga of Heathcliff, the foundling gipsy child and Catherine, the daughter of his benefactor (and their magnetic attraction), eagerly listening to Nelly regale the history of the Earnshaws and the Lintons, her knitting needles clicking away, when she tells of Heathcliff's hasty departure! By now, I am completely captivated, and that‚Äôs when Nelly ceases the recounting, stating that Mr. Lockwood needs his sleep. Never mind his sleep! I grumbled. Lockwood and I don't need any sleep, woman! Get on with it!

I wanted to reach into the pages and shake her! Where has Heathcliff gone? And what is going to happen to Cathy? Those two are the Richard Burton and Liz Taylor of their day! Tell! Tell! And be quick about it!
 
Thankfully, Nelly returned to the story after some urging from my good man Lockwood, and we find that Cathy has married Edgar Linton! She‚Äôs living at Thrushcross Grange with Edgar and his sister Isabella, and they are as happy as clams.

Then the poo hits the proverbial fan back at Wuthering Heights. 

Mr. Heathcliff comes strolling back into the picture, slick as you please, after three years away. He's looking all Rico Suave as he pops over to Cathy‚Äôs new digs, intending to stir the fire in her loins. And here she is married to another. Oh my! Next, the wilting flower, Isabella, upon laying her baby blues on ol' Heathcliff has a mighty yearning for the brooding bad boy, and all the while the devilish rogue is licking his chops at the thought of her juicy money. Cathy turns lime green with jealousy and Nelly is about to have a breakdown over the whole hot mess. It's code red over there!
 
The outcome for these dismally unhappy folks could hardly be a 'happily ever after' one ... Or could it? I won‚Äôt spoil Wuthering Heights for anyone who is yet to read this engrossing melodrama. The story is wild, dark and stormy, and I devoured it as if I was starving. The prose is so evocative as to create a movie in my mind that culminates in a spectacular finish. A story of vengeance, love, greed and the cost of evil deeds; but could there also be redemption? 
 
One of my favorite lines; Cathy says of Heathcliff:
""He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.""
 
I would urge anyone who hasn‚Äôt read this dazzling novel, to please give it a try. I‚Äôm still reeling!"
397,Annalisa,Gone with the Wind,"Dec 31, 2008",5,"It takes guts to make your main character spoiled, selfish, and stupid, someone without any redeeming qualities, and write an epic novel about her. But it works for two reasons. First of all you wait for justice to fall its merciless blow with one of the most recognized lines in cinema (""frankly my dear, I don't give a damn""), but you end with a broken and somewhat repentant character and you can't be pitiless. Secondly, if you were going to parallel the beautiful, affluent, lazy, spirited South being conquered by the intellectual, industrious North, what better way to do that than with characters who embody those characteristics? You come to feel a level of sadness that the South and Scarlett lost their war and hope that they will rebuild.

I enjoyed the picture of pre-war South outside of what you learn in history class approved by the nation that won the war. If the South had won, we would have an entirely different picture painted. A story of lush lands and prosperity abounding with chivalry and gentility by a (too) passionate people. If you visit the South today, you can see that all these generations later the wounds of the war and the regret at losing the way of life are still fresh. But if it had not been the civil war, it would have been by other means that the lazy sprawled out way of life would have been conquered by our efficient, compact, modern lives. 

I enjoyed the picture of plantations that did not abuse slaves to the extent that you read about in many memoirs. There was still a disrespect in that they viewed ""darkies"" as ignorant and childish and worthy of being owned, but there were those who cared for those in their trust. And the North who came down riling up the lowest of the slaves to flip the oppression did not want any contact with a race they feared. Prejudice takes many faces. Slavery is such an important part of American history, but I don't know that I agree with the format in which it is taught (at least the way it was taught to me). We take young, tolerant children and feed them stories of racism and abuse and then tell them the world is naturally prejudice (that they are prejudice) so don't be. White children start feeling awkward and aware and black children start feeling mistreated and aware. We manage to teach children about Indian and Holocaust history without the same enthusiasm to end racism by breeding racism. There has to be a better way. But I digress.

I also enjoyed Mitchell showing the volatile formula in which the KKK was aroused, that it wasn't just a disdain for free darkies but a need to protect their women and children from the rash anger now imposed on them through this new regime. Not that there are any redeeming qualities in the KKK, or even the Southern rash justice by pistol shot to curb wounded pride, but it was interesting to learn the wider circumstances in which it arose. The entire picture of the Southern perspective from the hierarchy of slaves to the disdain of the reconstruction was enlightening. The post-war difficulties, that sometimes it's harder to survive than die, were some of my favorite epiphanies of the story. What everyone in the South went through, both white and black, after everything was deconstructed and they didn't know how to rebuild. It wasn't just about freeing slaves but about rebuilding an entire way of life and sometimes change, even good change, can be this scary and destructive.

My one complaint about the book was at times the description was lengthy. I'd get a grasp for the emotions of Scarlett that are supposed to describe the emotions of all Southerners or the description of the land at Tara as a representation of the rich red soil all Southerners love and then Mitchell would go on for paragraphs or pages rehashing that feeling to pull the most emotion out of you. It worked, but sometimes I think she could have done so in fewer words. 

I view Scarlett as a representation of the South in which she loved. She did not care from whence the wealth came or believed that it would ever end. Because she was rich and important, she would conquer. As the Yankees attempted to rebuild the South, fresh in their embitterment at a war they did not want to fight, you can both see their reasoning and feel for the Southerners who were licked and then stomped on in their attempts to gain back of their life. You see that in Scarlett. On one hand you don't pity her and think she needs a lesson in poverty and on the other hand you want her to survive. Either she can lie down and cling to her old ways or she can debase herself and rebuild. Survival, not morality, is her strongest drive.

Oh Scarlett. We all know people like her. People who unscrupulously use their womanly charms to get ahead and carry a deep disdain for those bound by concepts of kindness, morals, or intelligence and most especially for those who see them for what they are instead of being manipulated. People who care for nobody but themselves and who find enjoyment in life not in what they have, but in conquering the unattainable that is only desirable because it is out of reach. I loved how Mitchell showed Scarlett's decline from a religious albeit not believing girl who allowed her rationalization and avoidance to carry her from one sin to the next of intensifying degree. An excellent portrait of the degradation of character. 

Initially I thought she was the only character who wasn't growing, actually digressing. But by the end she does grow up. In no regard is this greater than in her eventual desire to be a mother. Turning from her ravenous post-war desire to survive to her acceptance of life and the people around her as the way they are, eventually Scarlett grows into the person she was meant to be. As did the South. Prideful and resentful, eventually they had to accept that they lost the war and take what was given them and try to make it work.

Scarlett realizes that Melanie is not the weak, cowardly girl she always assumed but the most courageous character in the book and one who gets her means by influence and persuasion instead of Scarlett's uncivil ways. It is Melly, not Scarlett, who could get anything she desires and her heart is not her weakness but her greatest strength. Finally Scarlett values the importance of love and sees that it does not make one weak but deep to possess it. OK, I won't go that far. She's not intelligent enough to analyze love, but she grows up enough to fall for it anyway, to realize she needs people. 

She sees Ashley not as the strong, honorable character she had always esteemed but the weakest and least honorable character in the book. Anyone who would tease another woman with confessions of love just so he could keep her heart and devotion at arm's length is not truly honoring his marriage vows. The greatest gift he could give his wife was the knowledge that he loved her. And we all know that like any pretty toy, once Scarlett had taken him, she would have discarded him. The debasing knowledge that he is not fit for a rougher way of life doesn't endear him. For all his intelligence, he could have picked himself up by the bootstraps and made something of himself if he wanted to survive. He is a representation of the Old South that had to die but many couldn't let go of, even today. That's the sadness of the loss of the Southern way, still longing for the past instead of moving forward.

Then we come to Rhett, the only character with the ability to conquer Scarlett, who was quite the devil. Just like the ladies in old Atlanta I found myself at times entranced by his charms, but often I did not like or trust him. I was often torn about the way he constantly encouraged Scarlett to fall another wrung on her morality ladder and mocked her emotions, mocked all of Southern civility. What annoyed me most about him was that he showed love by coddling his wife and child until they were spoiled, dependent, but not grateful, and this was his idea of being a good father and husband. And yet I sympathized with him and was often amused by him. More than anything I enjoyed his intelligence as a way for Mitchell to introduce the Yankee viewpoint, using his sarcasm as satire. I loved the whole discussion of his not being a gentleman and her no lady.

More than anything I saw his slow conquering of Scarlett's heart as a parallel to the slow enveloping of the South by the North until they realized they were dependent on their conquerors but could still maintain their fierce spirit, a marriage of North and South. The fact that she could never fully understand him shows the divide between to two philosophies. But does the South lose in this blending? Can't they adopt the intellectual ways of the North and still maintain their civility? Just like Ashley, they would rather have dreamt and remembered than changed.

The characters in the book are so vivid that like or dislike you cannot get them out of your head. There are no more vibrant characters in the history of literature that Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. There is a reason this book is a classic. Everyone should read it at least once in their life to appreciate the civil war and understand the sadness and loss that enveloped the country."

399,Kimber Silver,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Jul 08, 2020",5,"""Then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affection had rotted away, and he could not find it.""

‚Äï Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude

This dazzling tale of the Buend√≠a family spans generations. It is a rich account of people carving out a life for themselves in Macondo, a town founded by the patriarch, Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a.

""At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.""

Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a is a corker! He is so hell-bent on making a wondrous discovery that he fritters away the family money on inventions purchased from a wandering troop of gypsies who miraculously show up in Macondo on occasion. Thankfully, his levelheaded wife (and first cousin), √örsula Iguar√°n, works herself to the bone to make sure the family won‚Äôt starve to death. During this fantastical journey, wars were fought, fortunes won and lost, and hearts wholly decimated, leaving the jilted lovers dead in a flower bed. It must be said that the Buendia family‚Äôs foolish choices are an endless source of drama and entertainment.

""Look at the mess we've got ourselves into,"" Colonel Aureliano Buendia said at that time, ""just because we invited a gringo to eat some bananas.""

I‚Äôve read M√°rquez before and loved his work, but this was a whole other animal! He expertly blurs the line between magic and realism so smoothly that it feels as if he was creating cinematic electricity! The horror is tempered by a big dose of whimsy that had me laughing through my tears. The writing is agonizingly beautiful, and each character exquisitely drawn.

In a lifetime of reading, there are only a few extraordinary novels that touch the very fabric of a person‚Äôs being‚ÄîFor me, One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of those. I was transported into M√°rquez‚Äôs dreamlike creation, and for the past few days had forgotten the real world and lived entirely in his. My only regret is that it all had to come to an end.

So, if you are looking for an epic novel to steal your breath away, look no further!

Thank you, Kevin Ansbro. Your outstanding review pointed the way to this magnificent read!"

401,Brett C,The Outsiders,"Apr 02, 2020",5,"This book has stood the test of time. The author has the ability to speak to everyone and anyone because of the emotional connectedness it exudes. The story is about youths, you could even say troubled youths. There is a coming-of-age presence in the book with all the characters, not just Ponyboy Curtis. There was a redeeming quality I found in the story because underlying we all have within ourselves something good. I also found that life is and can be difficult, but family can keep anyone grounded. I felt the author also hints at fate and one's perceptions of fate, such as Dally's and Johnny's sad background stories. You could say ""oh, they did it to themselves"" but there are outweighing external factors that left these two characters in pretty crappy situations. 

I found myself completely engaged during the church fire part and the consequent ambulance ride. The dialogue between Ponyboy and Mr. Jerry seemed so real and natural: ""Mrs. O'Briant and I think you were sent straight from heaven. Or are you just professional heroes or something?"", pg. 95

I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. The story, the dialogue, and the emotions are very real. 

Stay Gold, everybody! Thanks!"

‚§ê Overall.
Admittedly, this was not one of my favourite reads, not by a long shot. If it weren't for the giddy excitement of finally discovering the literary roots of one of my favourite film-trilogies, I wouldn't have ever made it through these. The writing style was magnificent, but the story-telling so lengthy at times I didn't know where to put my brainpower.

I was also very unsatisfied that John chose to stell the stories of the individual character(groups) in sets and not according to the timeline, alternating between the different POVs. It made me very impatient, and not in a good way.


The Two Towers
 was definitely my favourite in the series, it was the most exciting one and also allowed for much needed get-to-know-the-characters-time. You cannot help but really love the bromance between Gimli and Legolas (and Aragorn, to an extent). The introduction of the one and only Shadowfax was another highlight for me, the main reason I was attracted to the films as a kid. The horses in general are a particular beautiful part of the films, except that tons of them died during the making of the movies of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings."

The Written Review
:

To summarize: Mister. Darcy. 

*cue the long, sustained high-pitched squealing *

This was truly as glorious as I remember. Every time I reread this novel, I love it more.   The 
romance
, the 
high society
, the 
witty banter.
 Gah. I just adore it all. 
""And your defect is to hate everybody.""

""And yours,"" he replied with a smile, ""is willfully to misunderstand them.""
 Elizabeth Bennet  (second eldest of the five Bennet sisters) is the one with a  clear, level head.  Jane is the beautiful one, Mary is the look-at-me-I'm-so-pious one, Lydia is the I'm-so-dumb-that-I'm-probably-going-to-get-murdered one and Kitty is the well-she's-just-kinda-there one. 

Now, back in the day...there was one, singular goal for all women above the age of 16. GET YOURSELF A MAN  before you reach 25 and become a 
SPINSTER
 *cue high-society ladies fainting*. 
  Mrs. Bennet (their mother) has taken this so completely to heart that she thinks of nothing else. After all, 
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
 Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy moved into town and immediately Mrs. Bennett set her dasterdly plans in motion (on behalf of her mortified children). She will do whatever necessary to get a rich man to put a ring on it (oh Beyonce, your words are applicable in any century).
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.
 Only, there is a snag in her otherwise flawless plans. Elizabeth is not going to roll over to whatever man is thrust her way. To her mother's ever-living-disappointment, Elizabeth has all the spunk and backbone of a truly glorious woman: 
I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.
 Truly a great read, no matter the century.

Plus Jane Austen is totally my soul sister.
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.









Audiobook Comments
As with most old-timey books, It is far easier for me to listen to them than to read them. I like hearing the odd phrases and ancient unused words much more than struggling through the hard copy. I really enjoyed this audiobook and the narrator did a fab job of characterization.

404,karen,The Help,"Apr 08, 2010",5,"enthusiasm!!! 

this book and i almost never met. and that would have been tragic. the fault is mostly mine - i mean, the book made no secret of its existence - a billion weeks on the best seller list, every third customer asking for it at work, displays and reviews and people on here praising it to the heavens. it practically spread its legs for me, but i just kept walking. i figured it was something for the ladies, like sex and the city, which i don't have to have ever seen an episode of to know that it's not something i would enjoy. i figured that this book was on the ladder one rung above chick lit. so i am to blame for my snobbish dismissiveness, but have you seen this cover?? what is with that sickroom color scheme? and i hate those stupid little birds. what is chip kidd so busy doing that he can't just pop over here and lend a hand?? it is not my fault for thinking it was a crappy book when that cover wanted me to think it is a crappy book.

but this book is good. really, really good. again, i thank you, readers' advisory class, for fixing me up with this book. it has been a long time since i have read such a frankly entertaining book. (if a book about the emotionally-charged early days of the civil rights movement can be called entertaining.) this is just an effortlessly told story, split between three different women, whose voices and perspectives never run together - the secondary characters are also completely believable and are all different brands of repellent, with some token sympathetic characters tossed in for the halibut. i don't even know what to say, i just feel all ""aw, shucks, i loved this book"" about it - there were several times i would catch myself grinning at a turn of phrase or a situation, and every time i would start to doubt myself, that maybe i would like sex and the city. or buffy the vampire slayer  or all these things i have formerly judged without having read/seen/eaten. maybe i am like these white women in the book, taking their help for granted and assuming they have nothing to say to each other because of their unwillingness to talk to them and know them as human beings. maybe buffy and i have so much to learn from one another...

then i would snap out of it and remember that my gut opinions are 99.99% foolproof. 

so for you other people, who need to be swayed by hype - i give you hype. this book's hype is merited - it would be a perfect book to read this summer when you are melting from the sun and need a good story.. this is a very tender and loving book, about hope and sisterhood and opportunity, but also about beatings and terror and shame.

still hate those birds, though.

405,Baba,Wuthering Heights,"May 03, 2020",4,"A new tenant visits his lessee's grand home, the Wuthering Heights, only to find the most dysfunctional house he could imagine, from Master Heathcliff, down to the servants! On (finally) getting back to his lodgings he gets to hear the very dark history (recounted back to him over a number weeks) of the families that lived at Wuthering Heights and at his lodgings, The Grange. This book tells that story, a story of human savagery, artfully penned, taking on themes of gender equality, class, hypocrisy, selfishness, envy, and let's not forget, the frailty of the male ego. Emily Bront√´'s only finished novel caused a bit of a sensation when it was first published, and even today verges on being a tale of horror! I loved every single page of it, and spent an entire day wolfing it down. I had no idea that this work would be so readable and addictive. 9 out of 12, flaming Four Star read.

408,Henry Avila,The Great Gatsby,"Jun 30, 2011",5,"Jay Gatsby, is a mysterious young man, who gives extravagant parties on Long Island, New York, outside his palatial mansion , in the warm, lazy, summer nights. That he doesn't know the people he invites, not to mention the numerous gatecrashers, might make it a little strange, but this being the roaring 20's, anything goes, rumors abound about Gatsby, bootlegger ? Who cares, as long as the free liquor flows, the great food served, and the beautiful music, continues playing. Finally attending one of his own gatherings, we discover that he's after Daisy, a lost love, she's married, which complicates the delicate situation. Nick, Daisy's cousin, arrives in town and through him, reunites Gatsby with his former girlfriend, she enjoys luxury, which is why Daisy married rich Tom and not poor Jay. A catastrophic car accident kills Tom's girlfriend, yes, he's a creep but a wealthy one, it's vague who's responsible, but her husband thinks he knows. Death in a swimming pool, ends this tragedy and symbolizes the Jazz Age ... Thoughts: Gatsby was a tortured, lonely man, even shy, who tried to become a member of the establishment. He, with all his riches, needed to enter it, to become part of it, to feel alive but could never remove the dirt and his lowly, and embarrassing origins. They (the upper class), used him and laughed at the stranger behind his back, and the illusions about Daisy , a woman who never really existed, except in his distorted mind. The truth shocked Gatsby, the pretend gentleman but he could never let go of the mirage, if he did, there would be nothing left of his soul."
409,jessica,The Fault in Our Stars,"Aug 09, 2012",5,"i think most people will remember the first book that made them cry. 

TFIOS was mine.

this was a story of love, and loss, of grief, and hope, and all the infinities in between. words are incapable of expressing how tender and open my heart felt after reading this. it taught me what it meant to truly empathise with others. it taught me what it means to live. it taught me how to find the positive in the most hopeless of situations. and because of that, i know am a better person after closing this book than i was when i first opened it. 

and to john green, i cannot tell you how thankful i am for this little infinity. you gave me forever within the numbered pages, and im grateful.

410,Rachelfm,Jane Eyre,"Feb 11, 2013",1,"Reader, gaze upon my tortured physiognomy and answer me one question that I shall pose to thee in the languid torpor of the drooping, sinister twilight of my soul, one which surely reveals more of my own humble, Quakerish origins, unappealing countenance and begs you as my interlocutrice to satisfy my curiosity: why?

I can understand intellectually why this book would have been important when it was written and how its pivotal place in the history of the novel has shaped modern literature &c. but holy GOD it is like reading 507 pages of needlepoint. In which precious little happens except that you start to realize that editing must be a fairly young profession and that perhaps if you really hated your English students you could pick out one of the sentences that is roughly the same length as the Gettysburg Address and make them diagram it? For reals, you'd get these honking paragraphs that would start, ""There was..."" and then if you were diagramming you'd have a frightfully kudzu-covered six-story scaffold of indirect objects and modifiers trailing behind it.

What is it about Jane Eyre that seems to be an educated female rite of passage? I was somewhat looking forward to this book as it's an example of a strong woman who knows herself, but no. She's basically being ping-ponged between a couple of over-verbose dweebs who both have frightfully controlling tendencies and her only hope of independence is getting a windfall through the mother of all deus ex machina. 

Ladies: Jane is holding you back. 

Protip: if a guy twice your age who freely admits his proclivity for continental floozies, gruffly dismisses his own possible child except to underpay staff to deal with her, is intense and flies into passions, makes you mop up after and keep silent about assaults in your home and then fails to mention until you're at the altar that oh, he's married and the psycho who tried to kill you in your bed is actually his WIFE, you get gone and stay gone. 

Seriously, if I wanted to read about a teenager who spent half her time complaining about her looks and then dithering around about whether to go with the dark brooding intense hottie or the fair,marble-faced Greek god, I would go read Twilight."
411,Matthew,Of Mice and Men,"Jun 30, 2020",5,"I know that this is a reread for me, but I never had Of Mice and Men marked as read in Goodreads. I am pretty sure it was required reading in high school and I know I enjoyed it the first time around. And, as luck would have it, I enjoyed it this time as well.

I can sum it up by saying that Steinbeck can write (and that is an understatement)! I have loved every book I have read by him. The descriptions are vivid, the characters are richly developed, and stories are powerful. Of Mice and Men is no exception. In fact, if you have been wanting to try Steinbeck but find the size of Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden daunting, this is a great place to start.

Even if you have never read this book, you have probably seen many tributes/homages to its main characters George and Lenny; cartoons, movies, tv shows, etc. George is the gruff and scrappy brains of the operation while Lenny is a mentally challenged giant who does not know or understand his own strength. Their relationship is an odd one but kind of beautiful. Without it, this story would just not be the same.

Also, this book has one of the most (view spoiler)[tragic and gut-wrenching finales in literature (hide spoiler)]

This is a classic that I feel everyone should read. And, I feel like Steinbeck is an author that everyone should read at least once. The writing is just too amazing to miss out on and it is so awesome how consistently amazing Steinbeck was."
412,James,The Giving Tree,"Sep 05, 2016",4,"Book Review


I first read The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein when I was twelve-years old, but then I read it again in college as part of a course called ""Reading in the Elementary School."" My opinion didn't necessarily change between the two reads, but my eyes were opened a little wider. I never realized it was such a controversial book, nor that the author was sometimes considered not ideal for children, despite writing picture books for them.



The basic gist of the book revolves around friendship/love and abusing/using someone for what they can offer versus just enjoying the time with them. At first glance, it's a beautiful story about a little boy who loves his tree so very much... playing, swinging, climbing... But as he grows older, he no longer wants those things because he needs the very basic things in life we all need: food, shelter, warmth, water, etc. And he asks the tree for more and more until she is left a small and lonely tree stump. She's given away her apples and branches, been left alone for years at a time...

For young children, it's a lesson in how not to be selfish. How to learn the concept of give and take. How to be a friend and not abuse that relationship. Many argue it's a dark tale about a boy who never really learns his lesson, even in the end when goes back one final time to ask for one more thing -- a place to sit before he dies.

Yes, that's an over-exaggeration of the story, but depending on how/when you read the book, your perception of it could change. I think it comes down to Silverstein choosing not to ""sugar-coat"" the story... and show everything is all lovey-dovey in the end. He's essentially saying ""People will hurt you. Be careful."" And that is a lesson to teach children. 

I'm not a parent, and I didn't end up becoming a teacher; however, I am a firm believer in free speech and not keeping books away from people. Rather than banning a book, determine the age it should be read. There's nothing wrong with reading this book at a young age, as long as you're talking about it with a child. Ask them what they learned. Ensure they see both sides of the story. But don't let them do it all on their own so they take the wrong message from the picture or the words.

Yes, the boy was an a$$. True, the tree needed to learn earlier when to say ""no."" But we all want to feel loved. The book covers so many lessons in life, it's hard to keep track. For me, in the end, it's a solid book worth sharing with your kids. Perhaps not in school, as it is a lesson between parent / child / siblings -- at home -- as a family. All in all, I'm glad I read it a few times, and I hope everyone gives it a chance to think thru everything it's trying to say.

413,Magrat Ajostiernos,Mil soles espl√©ndidos,"Mar 06, 2021",4,"A pesar de las altas expectativas... ¬°¬°¬°Me ha encantado!!! 
Es cierto, hay momentos que te ves venir de lejos o tiene alguna l√≠nea argumental algo manida, pero son detalles muy peque√±os teniendo en cuenta lo que disfrut√© de esta novela que nos narra la historia reciente de Afganist√°n desde los a√±os 70 hasta los 2000.
Una historia que vamos a conocer a trav√©s de dos mujeres; Mariam (una campesina, pobre e hija ileg√≠tima de un hombre rico) y de Laila (la hija de un profesor universitario progresista, que aspira a que su hija estudie y sea alguien en la vida). Dos mujeres muy diferentes que terminan siendo el pilar de la otra.
Su vida se va a ver truncada por m√∫ltiples guerras y dictaduras, y a veces es tan duro lo que el autor narra que piensas que es una novela dist√≥pica lo que est√°s leyendo, pero como siempre la realidad supera a la ficci√≥n.
A pesar de la crudeza de algunos momentos (la tercera parte del libro es dur√≠sima), no consigue dejarte esa sensaci√≥n que te dejan otras novelas de completo desamparo... porque Laila y Mariam son adorables y empatizas con ellas demasiado, disfrutas con los breves momentos de felicidad que tienen como si fueran tuyos.
Adem√°s de todo esto es una novela que me tuvo atrapad√≠sima, no pude parar de leer hasta que la termin√©, y lo mejor de todo es que siento que he aprendido mucho con ella.

414,Lisa of Troy,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Dec 02, 2022",3,"Have you ever read a book and felt that you were missing something?

Yep, that‚Äôs me with A Wrinkle in Time.

Confession time: there were many parts of this book that made me giggle. Starting with the first line: It was a dark and stormy night. Then, the mention of stew. One member of my family thinks that stew is ew, and ‚Äústew‚Äù was mentioned six times in this relatively short book. Finally, the mention of IT. Trust me. I hate going to IT.

I was able to follow the plot‚Äîit seems relatively straightforward. However, the symbolism was lost on me (other than I know that there was some religious symbolism). A Wrinkle in Time makes me want to locate someone smarter than myself and ask them to explain it to me. 

At the beginning of A Wrinkle in Time, the author said that children get this book and adults do not. Maybe I am overthinking it? 

A Wrinkle in Time is a fast-paced fantasy novel. In my opinion, it was a little too fast-paced especially in the beginning where we are introduced to a deluge of characters. It was also a bit too focused on world building instead of on plot.

415,Ariel,The Fault in Our Stars,"Jan 10, 2012",4,"Reread #1, April 17th,2013

I'd like to start off by saying that my original review of this, the blurb I wrote when I first read this (which you can find below) is a lie. I never cried while reading this book. I know it's probably ridiculous to point it out, and honestly I could easily just continue with the lie, but it's a lie. When I originally finished this, when I was writing up the little blurb, every one around me was talking about how this book had broken them to pieces, how it had made them cry and cry, tears of sadness and of joy, and I thought the only way to express that I too really loved it was to say that I cried. Which is so ridiculous it saddens me. Because I did love this book. I do love this book. This is one of the best books I've ever read and reread and it's okay that I didn't cry. 

The problem I faced then I still now, however, as I still don't really know how to express myself. It's simple to say ""I cried,"" because people get that. ""Oh wow, it must have really hit her hard if she actually CRIED about it. Wowza pants!"" I don't know how to fully express myself but here's the best I can do for now.

Another truth is that I've never dealt with death, because so far I haven't had too. All of my grandparents have died before my existence, my aunts and uncles and cousins are in perfect health, and my family has never had family friends so I've never had to say good bye to anyone. I've only been to two funerals - one long ago that I barely remember except for the ""creepy old dead lady that looked like wax!"" that I attended when I was extremely young and one for the brother of a school mate. I think a lot of people think this book is about death, and it is. But it's not. It feels as though unless I don't have a sad story to tell my thoughts are not as valid as someone who does, and that might be true but to me my thoughts are valid and they are the only ones I have.

This story hits me hard because of two reasons (especially in regards to this rereading as I know that each time I reread it something new will be important). The first is the concept of who the hell we are and why the hell we're here. Augustus and Hazel face this more immediately then I do, they know their days are soon closed, but I deal with it too. It might seem trivial but I face this issue when I wonder what to study in school, what career to follow, what dreams to chase. Just because death isn't staring me straight in the eye at this moment doesn't mean I don't think about it. It doesn't mean I don't wonder what will become of me. Hazel and Augustus know that they are coming to the end, but I don't and I have a future ahead of me just as scary as the days they had in front of them. Some infinities are bigger than others.

The second is this idea of love. The elusive love. I am not an outwardly affectionate person, it's not really my ""scene"", and so although this book may or may not be primarily a love story it still is one and it aches me so to see two people so perfectly and imperfectly in love. It brings up those thoughts of ""Will someone ever love me like that?"" ""Will I ever find someone that I can love so importantly?"" You can shrug it off, I'm only 18, calm down, it'll happen, but I can admit, and this is a deep thought of mine that I probably shouldn't share with the internet and yet here it is, that I fear never loving someone or being loved by someone (who, of course, is not my family). The relationship between Augustus and Hazel is so god damn idyllic that maybe no one has had it, and yet I know millions have.

These were some random thoughts for you. I should be studying for exams and my mind I'm literally going crazy so maybe this doesn't make any sense to anyone but there you go. On a note, I think I enjoyed this story more the second time through.



First Read January 13th, 2012:
Have you ever cried because of a book?
I now have.

I didn't necessarily cry because of the events in the book, although I will admit they were contributing factors, I cried because the book brought to mind situations and ideas and concepts that I have lived and am living that sometimes feel overwhelming. And this book made them real and made me look at them.

This is the saddest and most depressing book I have ever read.
This is one of the funniest and wittiest books I have ever read."

417,Fabian,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,"Sep 01, 2009",3,"Randomness GALORE...! ...& yet, ISN'T THAT the reason the Disney tale is such a part of my early formative years?

Obviously, the Disney film is a combination of both books. As Alice wakes in the first book from her wacky adventures that all but defies psychoanalysis, her sister dreams about her sister dreaming. The second volume, as Alice is brought back to ""waking life"" from the Looking-glass House, she realizes that one of her feline pals has dreamt HER adventure. This last revelation, of being protagonist in someone's (something's) dream, is the point at which pretzel logicality is masterfully displayed.

David Lynch was undoubtedly inspired by the pseudo-symbolic and semi-metaphoric tales spun by the mad Carroll. There is insanity, & yet is not the rat worse-off than the pied piper?

419,Cindy,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Jan 30, 2020",3,"This book was okay. I didn't hate it or love it either way, though towards the end I realized how lukewarm I felt about the story since I would prefer to read any other book I had on hand. I appreciate the level of novelty in the world-building during the time this was first published. The friendship between the trio is cute. Hermione and Ron are fun characters and I might have enjoyed the book more if they had been the main protagonists. Downsides: I cringed at the excessive fatphobia, anti-semitism, and the turban part. I also didn't like that the final action of the book got skipped over quickly by having a fade-to-black moment and then a lengthy explanation told by one of the side characters. It felt like such an abrupt way to end the story... but TBH, I was glad to be done with it so I could move on to other books lol."

today i am 15 years old. everything is all bullshit, as usual. i can't believe how fucked everything is around me. like i'm surrounded by zombies. i can't talk to any of my so-called friends, i can't talk to jamie, i can't talk to my parents. who would bother listening anyway. i cannot wait to leave orange county! this place makes me fucking sick. everyone is a hypocrite. everything is so goddamn bright and shiny and sunny and meaningless. FUCK, life is so full of crap.

there is one good thing in my life though. just read this book Catcher in the Rye. blown away! i don't know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say. it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book. things i didn't even realize i felt were right there on the page! I LOVED IT. i think this is my favorite novel of all time. which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs. durham will force us to read it all. man i hate that bitch.

today i am 20 years old. life is great as usual. just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake-and-bake session with j-p, the sun is shining, the san diego weather is beautiful, and tonight i'm off to rob & gregg's to destroy them at bullshit. love that game! gregg says that joelle will be there (yes!) but she'll probably bring that prick pete with her. one of these days i'm going to lose it and kick his ass. ""i'm in a band""...fuck you, pete! i will never spin your records.

all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik's american lit class. it is not a bad class, although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam. or davidoff's survey of modern postmodernism last semester. now that was a class! it blew my mind. so many things to think about. the reading in american lit has been okay. but we've been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and it is terrible. can't believe i ever liked this book. caulfield is a whiny little bitch. the book has no depth. there is literally nothing going on with the narrative, style, theme, characterization, it is just one rote clich√© after another. he thinks he is such a rebel-without-a-cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless, stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism. completely inane and without meaning. i think my essay will use some acker-style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite ""classic"" truly is. i'm going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel, baby!

journal entry

today i am 25 years old. another gray, drizzly san francisco morning. i wish christopher would wake up, i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night. notes on my pillow, really?? time to grow up dude, i will never ""complete you"". well actually i'm glad he's still asleep, my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him. plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready. john is probably hard at work already, typical over-achieving behavior. i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor. it's time for them to leave! they've seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road. or learn to take a shower. this apartment is not the world's crashpad!

i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye. i remember hating this book in college for some reason. probably wasn't po-mo enough for me. or ""challenging"". feh. what a pretentious idiot i was. this is a beautiful book. it changed my life as a kid, i'm not sure how i would have survived orange county without it. just re-reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked-up shit in the world that kids have to deal with. i'm not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful. or funny! that part with the clipping-of-the-toenails is hilarious. ackley is such a douche. this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved. a perfect novel. it is so....""human"", i guess.

journal entry

today i am 30 years old. man my head hurts...so hungover! my birthday party last night was awesome. even got to spend some time on the turntables (thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once). i must have made out with a half-dozen people. sadly, no real action. i think last night's party will be the last big party i will ever throw. things have got to change. no more partying like the world is about to end, i still have my entire life ahead of me! tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice. i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter, that is not me. fuck them. if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House, than i am set. although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun. i'm 30 years old now for chrissakes! still, i've got to do something meaningful with my life. it cannot all be about booze, drugs, hooking up, and paying everyone's rent when they're broke. things have got to change.

i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts. what an inspiration! seriously, that is a classic novel. it is packed with meaning. i'm twice caulfield's age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way. my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change. i love you, holden caulfied. it's not too late for me to learn from you, to find some meaning in life.

journal entry

today i am 35 years old. another intense, sad, but deeply fulfilling week has passed. every day something meaningful happens, something so emotional and real. sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i've seen. working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY. but it is also beautiful. it's hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too. thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things. anyway. so now marcy wants to have a kid. i just don't know how i feel about that. this is such a fucked up world, do we really want to bring new life into it? i dunno. it seems....selfish, somehow. she should just quit her job with the d.a.'s office and get back to her roots in the public defender's office instead. does she think that having a child with me will bring more meaning into her life? my life has meaning enough already. and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else.

i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday, after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby. it was not an inspiring read. caulfield is so full of misplaced angst! i'm not sure i even understand him anymore. why is he so pissed off? he's seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people. i want to like him, i want to re-capture that feeling of affection i had for him, but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless, so naive. he really does not have it so bad. there is so much worse out there. i don't know how i would handle a kid like that. i hate to say it, but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it. oh the emotional self-absorption of youth! just you wait, caulfield. it sure gets a hell of a lot more complicated once you grow up.

journal entry

today i am 40 years old. when did i become a boss? it is like i woke up one day, mysteriously transformed into an old man. am i really a ""leader""? what does that even mean? sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me. last week i made a huge play on the Council, i had all my ducks in a row, and all the votes came in just as i had planned. everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact. some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in, even council members who voted against my motion - feh, phonies. the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd, almost disconnected from myself. is this who i am now, a public policy figure, a community advocate, a mayoral appointee? ugh, i can't stand the mayor. i don't feel like me. there is accomplishment there, and some satisfaction... but i am missing something, something visceral, something real. sweet Jesus, is this what a mid-life crisis feels like? it is a weird feeling, like i know everything that i need to know about the world, about the people around me, how everything connects, but yet i still feel like i know so little about life. oh, such angst, mark. surely you've outgrown this?

i've started re-reading A Catcher in the Rye. it's so strange, during different parts, i felt like crying. a wonderful and moving novel. i feel like i really understand holden, like he is my guide, my son, my brother, my friend... myself. i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen. it just has to happen. that's life after all, right?"

DNF @ p.18



So I'm probably going to book hell for not liking this book but I didn't really like PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, either, and those are sacred from what I'm told.



I read this as a teen and I remember thinking it was kind of boring then, although all the fights and relationship drama sort of interested me. The names were weird and kind of dumb, though. Now, as an adult, it all just feels so very Rebel Without a Cause-y.



Pass.

424,Tyler,Fahrenheit 451,"Dec 28, 2007",1,"Few appreciate irony as much as I do, so understand that I understand this review. The message of this book is decent: knowledge should not be censored. However, the rest of the book is utter shit. I found myself actually screaming at several points as Bradbury spent minutes and dozens of metaphors and allusions referring to one insignificant detail of the plot. It is too damn flowery to be understandable by anyone! In other words, an English teacher's dream. In addition, the story was about the message not the story in and of itself. Those of you who know me understand that this is that I detest most about classics, tied with how everyone reveres them without reading them.

The Coda and Afterword just add to the confuse making me confused on whether Bradbury is a very hateful man or just a hypocrite. The main plot of the novel itself is that the majority rule canceled out intellectualism while in the Coda (maybe Afterword, I don't remember which was which) Bradbury blasts minorities (all, including racial, religious, etc.) for creating an overly sensitive society. Oddly enough, his heroes are the minority. Ha. Furthermore, the Coda is a hefty ""Fuck you"" to anyone that wants to critique his work in any way not positive. Therefore, I feel obliged to respond in turn: ""Fuck you, Ray Bradbury. Your writing style is shit and I won't force it on my worst enemy."" Harsh, I know, but true. If you do need to read this book, I suggest a Cliff Notes version as long as you can appreciate that irony."

426,Ruby Granger,Jane Eyre,"Jan 16, 2021",5,Certainly one of the best novels ever written.
427,Steven Medina,Un mundo feliz,"Mar 16, 2021",5,"Libros as√≠ valen la pena leerlos mil veces. La mejor distop√≠a de todas. 

¬°Magn√≠fico libro, ha sido una gran sorpresa! Personalmente, pienso que Un mundo feliz es un libro que supera en todos los aspectos posibles a cualquier distop√≠a publicada hasta el d√≠a de hoy, incluyendo al famos√≠simo 1984 de George Orwell. S√≠, decir este tipo de declaraciones puede tomarse como una gran imprudencia de mi parte, pero, despu√©s de analizar cada aspecto de este libro he llegado a esa conclusi√≥n y estoy completamente seguro de lo que digo. 

En Un mundo feliz, Aldoux Huxley, nos presenta un hipot√©tico futuro en el que pr√°cticamente todo lo que conocemos ha sido alterado de una forma muy radical. No hay religiones, familias, nacimientos, emociones, amor, silencio, soledad, se desconoce el pasado, la ciencia ha sido eliminada, el conocimiento ya no es importante, etc.; pero tambi√©n es un mundo donde no existe el sufrimiento, ni la pobreza, ni el hambre, ni las guerras, y en el cual las personas tienen mejor salud ‚Äîincluso viven muchos a√±os m√°s‚Äî, no le temen a la muerte, etc. Esas caracter√≠sticas convierten este libro en una distop√≠a y utop√≠a a la vez, por lo que por momentos sentiremos que es un futuro horrible el que nos presenta Aldoux, pero tambi√©n observaremos que vivir en un mundo en el que no existe la miseria tampoco es tan malo como parece. Por lo tanto, la premisa que nos ofrece el autor es muy interesante porque nos hace preguntarnos: ¬øPreferir√≠as vivir en un mundo con ciencia y conocimiento pero atiborrado de guerras, muerte y tragedia, o preferir√≠as vivir en un mundo pac√≠fico y estable, pero totalitario y lleno de ignorancia? Como pueden notar, elegir cualquier opci√≥n nos brindar√≠a muy buenos privilegios pero asimismo grandes desventajas. Y no, no se puede erradicar todo lo negativo de un futuro porque se necesita un equilibrio, por lo que por ejemplo para que existan los milagros se necesita que exista el sufrimiento, o la presencia de la ciencia llevar√≠a irremediablemente a la desconfianza, miedo, guerras y autodestrucci√≥n: Es algo inevitable.

En cuanto a los personajes, son seres que est√°n completamente trastornados pero que viven pl√°cidamente en esa √©poca. Esto ocurre porque todos sus pensamientos y comportamientos son manipulados desde antes de ser creados, por lo que son como un estilo de ¬´m√°quinas programadas¬ª que fueron hechas para pensar y actuar de una manera espec√≠fica: Son personajes muy bien dise√±ados a pesar de su excentricidad y anormalidad. Naturalmente no me encari√±√© con ninguno pero tampoco los aborrec√≠ porque es comprensible su forma de vivir. Puede que para nosotros ese estilo de vida pueda ser contraproducente, pero cada generaci√≥n de seres humanos ha crecido bajo un entorno, vocabulario, cultura, profesiones y sue√±os diferentes, por lo que es natural ese rechazo hacia un estilo de vida contrario al que llevamos. Es por esta raz√≥n por la que nuestros abuelos se quejan de nuestro mundo actual, pero a la vez subrayan las virtudes de la √©poca en que nacieron, y de esa misma forma nosotros actuaremos en el futuro cuando tengamos m√°s de cincuenta a√±os. La humanidad nunca dejar√° de cambiar por lo que seguramente para cada generaci√≥n Un mundo feliz ser√° diferente. Los personajes de este libro viven en Un mundo feliz, los piratas vivieron felices en el mar, quienes creen en Dios viven felices orando, los reyes vivieron felices con sus comodidades y su poder, los campesinos no cambiar√≠an el campo por nada del mundo, los guerreros sin una espada ser√≠an desdichados, etc. Por ello, el nombre del libro me parece s√∫per correcto porque presenta justamente lo que anuncia: Un mundo feliz.

Algo curioso de este libro es que la trama principal pasa a un segundo plano. Es tan atrapante conocer m√°s y m√°s detalles sobre el lugar donde viven los personajes, que en realidad el destino de ellos importa muy poco. El argumento es simple y predecible, y quiz√°s podr√≠a ser el punto m√°s bajo de esta n√≥vela, pero en una distop√≠a/utop√≠a eso es algo normal porque en este tipo de libros lo verdaderamente interesante es la visi√≥n futurista que nos presenta el autor. En este caso, esa visi√≥n futurista el autor la realiza de manera magistral, y lo mejor, es que el autor no escribe con odio. ¬°Eso me encant√≥! Recuerdo que cuando le√≠ 1984 el libro me pareci√≥ muy interesante, pero el autor escribi√≥ con tanto odio hacia la sociedad, que irremediablemente asocie esas similitudes con tantas protestas e inconformidad que se vive actualmente en la mayor parte del planeta; pero aqu√≠, Aldoux presenta un libro sin una pizca de rencor u odio, a pesar de reconocer en el pr√≥logo que est√° completamente en contra del totalitarismo. Y ya que menciono el pr√≥logo, tengo que reconocer que esa parte del libro es excelente. En esa secci√≥n el autor realiza una gran explicaci√≥n sobre la creaci√≥n de su historia, errores, personajes, etc., pero contiene spoilers por lo que recomiendo que lo lean al finalizar el libro y no antes.

La prosa tambi√©n ha sido adecuada lo que permite que esta novela se lea rapid√≠simo; aunque, el inicio fue un poco lento y confuso debido a la terminolog√≠a relacionada a los genes que personalmente me pareci√≥ muy dif√≠cil de asimilar: La gen√©tica no es mi especialidad. Aun as√≠, Aldoux ha sabido jugar muy bien con el estilo de la obra y me ha gustado mucho la forma como lo ha hecho. Mi parte favorita de la prosa fue una secci√≥n donde se presentan tres conversaciones simult√°neas y tan solo separ√°ndolas por p√°rrafos, logra un efecto de adrenalina y un ritmo fren√©tico que puede dar a entender que efectivamente si nos repiten excesivamente una informaci√≥n, puede que empecemos a usar esas ideas como si fueran nuestras, a pesar de que solo las han implantado en nuestra mente. Asimismo, la parte final ha sido espectacular porque nos da una c√°tedra sobre la sociedad impresionante. Pr√°cticamente cada una de las frases usadas all√≠ son dignas de destacar porque son muy profundas, sencillas de entender y pueden convertirse en una informaci√≥n muy importante para cada uno de los individuos de una sociedad, es decir, para todos nosotros. Entre esa informaci√≥n, se destaca la necesidad de que exista en una sociedad las clases sociales, ya que sin ellas lo √∫nico que ocurrir√≠a ser√≠a un caos total. Hay much√≠simas frases para destacar, pero solo har√© menci√≥n de dos porque descubrir esas frases hace parte del premio de quien se anima a leer esta obra:


¬´Bueno, si usted quiere, puede llamarlo un experimento de reenvasado. Se inici√≥ en el a√±o 73 d.F. Los Interventores limpiaron la isla de Chipre de todos sus habitantes anteriores y la colonizaron de nuevo con una hornada especialmente preparada de veintid√≥s mil Alfas. Se les otorg√≥ toda clase de utillaje agr√≠cola e industrial y se les dej√≥ que se las arreglaran por s√≠ mismo. El resultado cumpli√≥ exactamente todas las previsiones te√≥ricas. La tierra no fue trabajada como se deb√≠a; hab√≠a huelgas en las f√°bricas, las leyes no se cumpl√≠an, las √≥rdenes no se obedec√≠an; las personas destinadas a trabajos inferiores intrigaban constantemente por conseguir altos empleos, y las que ocupaban estos cargos intrigaban a su vez para mantenerse en ellos a toda costa. Al cabo de seis a√±os se enzarzaron en una aut√©ntica guerra civil. Cuando ya hab√≠an muerto diecinueve mil de los veintid√≥s mil habitantes, los supervivientes, un√°nimemente, pidieron a los Interventores Mundiales que volvieran a asumir el gobierno de la isla, cosa que √©stos hicieron. Y as√≠ acab√≥ la √∫nica sociedad de Alfas que ha existido en el mundo.¬ª

El p√°rrafo anterior no hace referencia a conformarnos con la vida que nos toc√≥, sino hace referencia a que cada individuo en una sociedad es igual de importante, y todos seremos felices cuando encontremos nuestro verdadero lugar en ella. Los seres humanos somos sociables por naturaleza, y aunque nos duela aceptarlo, somos m√°s felices cuando encontramos personas con quien hablar sobre nuestros gustos, sue√±os, etc. De la misma forma como una construcci√≥n necesita de buenas columnas, bases y muros estables, una sociedad necesita de todas las clases sociales para que exista un equilibrio, pero para que exista ese equilibrio se necesita que el pueblo se sienta satisfecho constantemente para que no afecte la estabilidad de la naci√≥n. No es bueno tener muchos l√≠deres, pero tampoco es positivo no tenerlos. 


¬´Actualmente el mundo es estable. La gente es feliz; tiene lo que desea, y nunca desea lo que no puede obtener. Est√° a gusto; est√° a salvo; nunca est√° enferma; no teme a la muerte; ignora la pasi√≥n y la vejez; no hay padres ni madres que estorben; no hay esposas, ni hijos, ni amores excesivamente fuertes.

Al iniciar el libro cre√≠ que ser√≠a una obra recomendada para que los adictos a las drogas dejaran de consumir esas porquer√≠as, pero despu√©s de avanzar entend√≠ que ser√≠a mal√≠simo que una persona adicta leyera este libro porque justamente se sentir√≠a orgulloso de su proceder. Por lo tanto, si tienen un familiar o amigo que en este momento tiene problemas de ese tipo, por nada del mundo les mencionen este libro porque podr√≠an terminar de corromperse. 

En resumen, un libro corto pero muy profundo e interesante sobre el comportamiento humano, la sociedad, las clases sociales y la religi√≥n, que seguramente no olvidar√°n nunca y querr√°n repetir varias veces porque sinceramente es una obra maestra en todo el sentido de la palabra. Es una novela que me ha encantado en todo momento, la volver√© a leer en el futuro, quiero seguir analiz√°ndola, e incluso siento el deseo de realizar un podcast sobre este libro ‚Äîa pesar de que nunca he hecho uno‚Äî para seguir profundizando y hablando sobre esta obra, que me ha parecido bastante, pero bastante interesante. Libro s√∫per recomendado, excepto si tienes una adicci√≥n y quieres superarla, en ese caso, l√©elo en otro momento."
428,Elizabeth,Pride and Prejudice,"Nov 30, 2008",1,"NOTE: The review you are about to read was written in 2009. 2009! That's over 10 years ago! I was 17 and thought I was the smartest person ever! In all honesty, I barely remember this book. So, negative comments regarding my intelligence are no longer necessary. They will be ignored. As they have been for probably 7 years now. CARRY ON!

P.S. Can we all just LOL at my use of the words ""mind-numbing balls""?? HA. 

This book is quite possibly the most insipid novel I have ever read in my life. Why this book is so highly treasured by society is beyond me. It is 345 pages of nothing. The characters are like wispy shadows of something that could be interesting, the language that could be beautiful ends up becoming difficult to decipher and lead me more than once to skip over entire paragraphs because I became tired of having to stumble through them only to emerge unsatisfied, and the plot is non-existent, as though Austen one day decided she wanted to write a novel and began without having any idea what would happen except that there would be a boy and a girl who seemingly didn‚Äôt like each other but in the end got married. The story really probably could have been told in about 8 pages, but Austen makes us slog through 345 pages of mind-numbing balls and dinner-parties. I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, this is not great literature. This is a snore.

Read my review of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."
429,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Jul 20, 2022",5,"Oscar Wilde tells us the story of Dorian Gray, who was obsessed with beauty and youth. His narcissistic obsession with beauty made him trade his soul for eternal youth. 

I think this is one of those few novels that was the topic of many Psychological studies. The morality aspect of this novel has been a topic of discussion for more than a century now. This is a book that the celebrities of our generation should undeniably read. It shows the plight of unnecessary obsession that will destroy our soul and conscience. 

The philosophy in this novel will make you contemplate for a long time. This is one of those novels that you should never miss.

430,Baba,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Oct 24, 2016",5,"""Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" That was Atticus' advice to Scout and Jim, before the onset of African American Tom Robinson's trial for the alleged rape of a white woman in a town in the Deep South, in the United States in the 1930s. A work of genius, of pure perfection, the best book I have ever read.

On every single level, this book is flawless.

Thank you Harper Lee.

432,Melki,Anne of Green Gables ,"Aug 07, 2015",5,"""Well now, she's a real interesting little thing,"" persisted Matthew.

Truer words were never spoken when the whirlwind known as Anne Shirley comes to live with siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert at Green Gables.

In one terrific example of cosmic trickery, the Cuthberts, who were hoping to adopt a boy to help out around the farm, are sent instead a garrulous and imaginative, red-headed girl. Matthew takes to her immediately. Marilla needs some convincing.

""Matthew Cuthbert, you don't mean to say you think we ought to keep her!""

Marilla's astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had expressed a predilection for standing on his head.

""Well now, no, I suppose not -- not exactly,"" stammered Matthew, uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. ""I suppose -- we could hardly be expected to keep her.""

""I should say not. What good would she be to us?""

""We might be some good to her,"" said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.

Poor Anne, who has spent her brief life in foster homes caring for the children of drunkards, or penned up in an orphan's asylum, is devastated.

""You don't want me!"" she cried. ""You don't want me because I'm not a boy!""

But, of course she gets to stay, and as Matthew predicts, they are indeed good for her. The surprising thing is how good she is for them. Anne's unbounded enthusiasm for the world around her is infectious, and before long, Marilla finds herself reminded of the young girl she once was.

""All sorts of mornings are interesting, don't you think? You don't know what's going to happen through the day, and there's so much scope for imagination.""

 
Imagine Anne's delight at seeing Prince Edward Island for the first time.

If you ever need a reminder of how amazing the world can be, look no further than Montgomery and her plucky, indomitable heroine.

433,J.G. Keely,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"May 28, 2009",5,"The universe is a joke. 

Even before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey. 

Between the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.

For all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.

It is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').

Reading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.

We see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying. By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it, Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state, and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true.

It's all a joke, it's all ridiculous. The absurdists might find this depressing, but they're just a bunch of narcissists, anyhow. Demanding the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis, attractive people in bathing suits, and Euler's Identity. I say let's sit down at the bar with the rabbi, the priest, and the frog and try to get a song going. Or at least recognize that it's okay to laugh at ourselves now and again. It's not the end of the world.

It's just is a joke, but some of us are in on it."
434,Brian Yahn,The Secret Garden,"Sep 30, 2013",2,"The Secret Garden is a ""lovely"" story in every sense of the word. Primarily, it's about three kids: Mistress Mary, Dickon, and Master Colin--and how just thinking a little differently can change a person completely.

There's a lot of subtle things Frances Hodgson Burnett does right: The way she relates the Garden to Colin's mother and how that affects his relationship with his father--and how all of these things have made him a horribly spoiled brat. That thinking a little differently, and getting some fresh air, and fixing up a Secret Garden can simultaneously fix up his life and his relationship with his father.

Even though it packs a nice punch and does a lot of little things right, the story overall is a tough read. And it goes beyond just being dated and having awkwardly constructed sentences. It's more than the dialogue and the Yorkshire accent most of the characters speak with that makes what they're trying to say almost impossible to decipher for a modern English speaker.

The pacing is awful. There really isn't any conflict. So it's REALLY hard to get into. And that's sad, because it really is a lovely tale."
435,Madeleine,A Wrinkle in Time ,"May 14, 2012",5,"I have one general, self-imposed rule about reviewing on this site: I write about the books I've read in the order I've finished them. By that logic, I should be cobbling together my reaction to Hunger right now but I am so taken by this childhood staple that there's no room in my brain for anything other than uncontrollable glee over this book that another Madeleine has given to the world. 

I never read this book as a kid. I didn't read it as a teenager or a college student. I read it for the first time with 30 coming at me like a crazed stalker who won't let a pesky thing like a restraining order stand in the way. And that did concern me, especially after half-heartedly slogging through the first four books comprising the Narnia Chronicles a few years ago before taking an indefinite break from tackling what should have been another enthusiastically remembered staple of a young reader's diet. I was afraid that I'd completely missed out on enjoying A Wrinkle in Time, a novel that I have heard praised up and down by so many people as the prime example of how good children's literature can be. 

So I read it like I read as a wee lass who didn't realize that she was poised at the very beginning of what would become a lifelong pursuit of books fueled by an insatiable need to keep reading. I read well past my bedtime with one tiny light illuminating the path to somewhere magically transportive, knowing full well that the bookworm gratification far outweighed the inevitability of being a zombie all morning. I read it when I should have been doing something else as dictated by responsibility. I read to be told a story and to consider ideas I'd never come across in the world beyond two covers, sure, but mostly I read to give myself up to a writer's lush landscape, to lose myself in someone else's words. I read it to let my imagination run free through a universe I fervently and fruitlessly wished to be a part of. 

And my adult self was just as enchanted as my inner child was. Sure, A Wrinkle in Time has its faults but I honestly couldn't tell you what they are because I was so thoroughly entertained, so taken with these characters I couldn't believe I could relate to in a way that was far less remote and removed than I expected (which is to say, at all) that all the things my nitpicky, pretentious post-English-major self would usually hone in on paled in comparison to the sheer enjoyment of the rush of letting a book completely suck me into its world to the point where the real world could have collapsed around me and I wouldn't've either cared or noticed because I was so wrapped up in this story.

On one hand, yeah, I do feel a little cheated that so much of what I needed to hear as a kid has lived within these pages all this time and I could have had such imperatives by my side to ease the pains of childhood's harsh but necessary learning experiences had I just shown even a fraction of some interest in this book. Among them: One's parents are not infallible. Weaknesses can become strengths -- nay, tools integral to besting some truly harrowing obstacles -- in the right circumstances. That sometimes you have to face down scary or unpleasant truths, and you're not excused from looking away or backing down just because the task ahead is either scary or unpleasant. It's better to embrace your individuality and not compromise yourself, no matter how uncomfortable you are in your own skin, than to mindlessly submit to the herd mentality and easy conformity. Just because something appears strange doesn't make it bad -- or all that strange at its core, after all. What things are is infinitely more important than what they look like. 

But conversely? This book drenched my ordinary existence with fantasy's magic for a few days, and I'm sure it'll stick with me in the days to come. My first encounter with this book wasn't a foggily but fondly recalled childhood memory that's destined to be tarnished by the darkening cynicism of the years upon revisits from my older self. I got to experience the breathless wonder of a kid discovering an instant favorite for that very first time as an oasis of sheer escapist rapture in the face of a few intense work days and the humdrum nature of routine adulthood. And it proved to me that I don't always have to be such a goddamn snob about kid lit because when it's good, it is extraordinary. (And, really, let's be honest: Younger Me wasn't exactly the sharpest crayon in the tool shed, so who's to say I would have picked up on the more subtle elements that made this such a delightful read, anyway?)

Despite my natural inclination toward hyperbole, I am not exaggerating when I say I'm a little better for having read this book, one that I initially arrived at out of dubious curiosity and left in a state of giddy, childlike awe. And maybe a few tears."
436,Vit Babenco,Gone with the Wind,"Apr 10, 2013",1,"Is it the stream of consciousness?
Oh, why was he so handsomely blond, so courteously aloof, so maddeningly boring with his talk about Europe and books and music and poetry and things that interested her not at all ‚Äì and yet so desirable?

She loved him and she wanted him and she did not understand him.

The short but interesting lives, young marriages and early exists, the atmosphere thick with unseen calamities...Romeo , a Montague, loves Juliet, a Capulet...that is a big problem, the two teenagers don't care or understand the long lasting bloody feud, between their families. Hate is not them, passion is...the opposite...a great love consumes the immature couple , after just a few hours of knowing each other they impulsively decide on a secret marriage. Romeo had gone with his friends to a perilous, masquerade party given annually by Juliet's father, at his house, the sumptuous feast is strictly off -limits to their archenemies the Montagues, of course this makes for a rather tantalizing challenge, brave or moronic , the youths want some excitement...The Montague stranger immediately falls in love with this supposedly loathsome girl , of the rival evil clan, the daughter of the leader , the couple are smitten... not knowing their true identities, yet nothing matters to Romeo and Juliet, even after the revelations ... except feelings, too much so it will cause heartache.

Romeo is banished forever from town, the distraught daughter of a Capulet is told to marry Count Paris a relative of the ruler Prince Escalus ...How can a 14- year-old girl, not quite a woman, cope. Her adoring servant, who raised her, yet an uneducated nurse, tells Juliet to marry Paris and forget her first wedding...Will she... Friar Lawrence has a dangerous plan... the only hope for the pair, it could result in a happy solution ....A story that will be read again and again...love is always in fashion , especially the kind that engulfs every walking minute in a young life...they know nothing else."

EVERY STAR THERE IS TO STAR!!!!!!





Yeah, a little bit. It‚Äôs also the best book in the history of ever. 

Sure it has a little kissing





but it also has pirates





and bad guys





and swordsmen





and giants





and R.O.U.S.es





I‚Äôm not writing a synopsis. I‚Äôm not writing a review. I‚Äôm just telling you if you have not already read it, read it now. 

You ask: ‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt like it????‚Äù INCONCEIVABLE!





If you read it, hate it, and have the desire to 1 Star it or say bad things, you should probably unfriend me first. I might be inclined to light your ass up. Just kidding. Maybe.



 ‚ÄúCome my love, I'll tell you a tale
Of a boy and girl and their love story
And how he loved her oh so much
And all the charms she did possess

Now this did happen once upon a time
When things were not so complex
And how he worshipped the ground she walked
And when he looked in her eyes he became obsessed

This love was stronger than the powers so dark
A prince could have within his kingdom
His spells to weak and steal a heart
Within her breast but only sleeping

He said ""Don't you know I love you oh so much
And lay my heart at the foot of your dress?""
She said ""Don't you know that storybook love's
Always have a happy ending?""

Then he swooped her up just like in the books
And on his stallion they rode away
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel""

442,PurplyCookie,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Jan 20, 2011",1,"The story takes about 100 pages of tedious, banal dialogue, to get to the point where you are told that this is a battle against Evil, and all you need is love. But everything is so oversimplified, so sketchy--everything is reduced to big words, like IT, and evil. This IT, also called the Dark Thing, is striving to create a communist-type society where everyone conforms, down to the little children who bounce their balls in uniform rhythms and who live in cutter-box houses. 

I liked Meg in the beginning, she was a believable character, filled with her own problems, and I really wanted for things to work out for her. But when she went on her journey, and especially since she got to that dreadful communist planet, she got hysterical. She did not ‚Äúsay‚Äù anything for half of the book--she yelled, gasped, screamed, cried, etc. She got ticked off at everyone for everything.

Then there might have been an indication that Charles Wallace was going to be a player, but he fizzled. There are constant references to him being special, but we never find out what was so special about him, besides putting a 30 year old into a 4 year old body and calling it ‚Äúgenius‚Äù. There was all this build-up for the confrontation between him and IT, but nothing happened. He looked at the guy, let him in, and became filled with ideas from Lenin himself.

Then there are worlds. These characters traveled to a planet that was described in three lines with beautiful flowers and a tall mountain. Then another planet is not described at all except to say that it was a winter wonderland type of a place. The residence of the Happy Medium was another planet where they were conveniently in a cave, and final stop was in a planet that was probably like Earth, except all we know about it is that it had rows of houses and tall buildings. There you have it--traveled all through the known Universe and have nothing to show for it. No imagination to describe and develop a world.

Then there are bizarre references to god/s that come out of nowhere, or in the oddest places, and disappear into nowhere. Characters are underdeveloped; scenes are not finished; worlds are left to themselves; theme is the fear of religious right of the communist left.

It's a caricature of evil, done perhaps in the belief that kids won't get it otherwise. There's not much in terms of a plot, the worlds described are paper-thin, and it shows no historical understanding, no outside knowledge.

- Frank Sinatra ."
446,Melanie,Jane Eyre ,"Apr 22, 2018",5,"‚ÄúI am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.‚Äù


Okay, so high school Melanie did not appreciate Jane Eyre! But thankfully, many years later, and because of a few friend‚Äôs encouragement, I have seen the light and righted my wrongs, because this reread proved to me how much of a masterpiece Jane Eyre truly is. 

This is a very beloved book, that stars an orphan girl name Jane that is trying to figure out the world around her. She‚Äôs searching for worth, for love, and all the middle area in-between. When she is very young, she is forced to live with her not-so-nice aunt, who is absolutely terrible to her. But soon, her aunt sends her off to an all-girls boarding school, but Jane starts to learn who she is and who she wants to be, and after getting her education, she begins to teach at this school that she now considers her home. 

But at nineteen, she decides that she would like to try to be a governess so that she can travel and see the world that she has learned so much about. Jane gets a job teaching a young girl at Thornfield Hall, but soon meets the master of Thornfield Hall, none other than Mr. Rochester himself. 

Mr. Rochester is distant, and rude, and a bit grumpy, but the more and more time Jane and him spend together, the more and more they realize they have a lot in common. And they develop quite a strange and unconventional relationship, while many spooky and mysterious things are happening at Thornfield Hall.

This book is very protofeminist. Jane has so much rage and anger inside of her, because of the gender roles and expectations that are always set on her. On top of always being sent to places where she is forced to live and be molded into what is expected of her. Jane finally gets to live for herself at Thornfield Hall, and she does so unapologetically. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Jane stands up for herself constantly, and at every age, throughout this story, but seeing her come into her own, and never backing down from her beliefs on what is right, is something so very awe-inspiring.



‚ÄúI care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.‚Äù


And so many important themes are in this book! From classism, to marriage, to gender roles, to witchcraft, to slavery, to abuse, to power dynamics, and to so much more. And the things brought up in this book? That was first published in 1847? And I stan one feminist icon, and it‚Äôs Charlotte Bront√´. I can‚Äôt even image what the world thought of this throughout the ages, because it spoke to my very soul in 2018. Seriously, I will forever be in awe of this book and this author, and I truly mean it when I say that she‚Äôs a new icon for me. 



‚ÄúGentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agised as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.‚Äù


I ended up being a sucker for the romantic subplot in this book, too, even though I can see how many terrible, wrong, bad choices the love interest made. But Jane always puts herself first, and even though she wants to be loved more than anything, she will constantly fight for her own place in the world where she lives on her own terms for her own beliefs. Jane loves herself, and in turn it made me love Jane, and this masterpiece of a story. 

Overall, I fell completely in love with this. This was so intelligently crafted and so expertly woven! And the dark feelings and vibes throughout really makes this such a unique and amazing reading experience. And I think this is a book that I will be able to read and reread over and over for the rest of my life. You also best believe that if I ever have children, this will be required reading once they get a bit older, because this book seriously has an immense amount of power. And I truly believe this is my favorite classic of all-time now. And I never want any woman to feel like a bird trapped in a cage.

447,Debbie W.,Little Women,"Jan 04, 2020",4,"I wanted to reread this story since another movie has been recently released based on this book, and also because I forgot what it was about since I read it in 1972. I began rereading my old copy that I bought when I was in Grade 4, and after comparing it with the ebook version my daughter was reading, I realized that my modern abridged edition, published in 1955, was pretty much cut in half, with only 283 pages. Several phrases, sentences, paragraphs and even whole chapters were omitted! Therefore, I purchased the latest edition (published 2019 with a cover depicting the actresses from the latest movie). Needless to say, a lot of questions were now answered!

Overall, one has to be mindful that this story was first published in 1868 (over 150 years ago), so language, thoughts, mores and behaviors were quite different then than they are today. I suppose readers back then would have found this book to be quite forward-thinking. As for myself, I found this book to be, in a word, charming. Even the ""sex scene"" between Meg and John was alluded to with such delicacy that you could miss it if you weren't paying close attention. And even though I remembered that Beth dies, I still had tears in my eyes while reading the touching prose describing her death. 

If you are interested in reading classic literature, put this book on your ""To Read"" list!"
448,Era ‚û¥,City of Bones ,"Dec 08, 2020",2,"Why is the guy on the cover sparkly, and why does he look like he's been scribbled on by a toddler? This isn't Twilight, is it?
Oh wait. 

Okay, I'll concede this: the plot is a bit different. But the romance and the characters and the quality of the writing were...about on the same level.

Two stars. I did not enjoy this.

Everyone was recommending this book and a lot of my friends loved this series, so I tried out the first book. Again. After DNF‚Äôing it twice. Everyone was like, just make it through the first half and you‚Äôll love it, or, make it through the first book and you‚Äôll need the second one.

I made it through‚Ä¶and I still didn‚Äôt enjoy it.

Where do I start? There is a whole list of things that were just wrong.

The writing. I mean, at least it was comprehensible? I don‚Äôt understand why it was written the way it was. I mean, the narrative itself was okay (except for our whiny, clueless, annoying narrator, also known as Clary Fray), but the dialogue and the descriptions were‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt know a single being (human or otherwise) that would speak like that.

‚ÄúIt's a girl,"" Jace said, recovering his composure. ""Surely you've seen girls before, Alec. Your sister Isabelle is one.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's why when major badasses greet each other in movies, they don't say anything, they just nod. The nod means, 'I am a badass, and I recognize that you, too, are a badass,' but they don't say anything because they're Wolverine and Magneto and it would mess up their vibe to explain.‚Äù

Someone please tell me they know someone who would actually speak like this in normal, everyday conversation. 

‚ÄúI'm not unhappy,"" he said. ""Only people with no purpose are unhappy. I've got a purpose.‚Äù

Oh yes. This is exactly how people speak in normal context. I always talk about my level of happiness and my purpose in life. It‚Äôs normal human interaction. 

(I hope you can detect the level of sarcasm in that statement.)

The characterization. Pretty boring and one-dimensional. The attempts to add layering to a character were usually pretty abrupt and out-of-place because there was no effort to make it gradual or consistent. There was also no character development. I could sum up all the characters in three words.

Clary ‚Äì annoying, clueless, needy

Jace ‚Äì arrogant, jackass, idiot

Isabelle ‚Äì bitchy, angry, inconvenient (although I did like her a bit more than everyone else, mostly because she actually seemed like she had a brain)

Alec ‚Äì rude, anxious, awful

Simon ‚Äì nerdy side character

Need I go on?

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre both famous, ‚ÄúIsabelle said in that same overbright voice (for the record, my computer doesn‚Äôt believe ‚Äúoverbright‚Äù is a word. Seriously what even is this writing) ‚Ä¶ Clary looked at Isabelle curiously. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect you to be this glad to see me, I have to admit.‚Äù

Yeah that‚Äôs because of something called character inconsistency, which took the place of any real character dimension.

Also, what was up with Jace calling Clary ""little girl""? It's a stupid nickname for two reasons: One, because Clary and Jace are the same age, and two, because it's condescending. Why is it condescending? I have no idea. It's not like Jace is good at anything except for stupidity.

The plot. It dragged and really didn‚Äôt go anywhere. There wasn‚Äôt much development. The world-building wasn‚Äôt very nuanced either. Guess what Clary, you can see magic shit now. Everything that you see is magic shit. The weird people you met at a club are magic shit. You are magic shit.

Yeah. That‚Äôs the plot. At least it was explained in a comprehensible way I guess.

‚ÄúEverything you‚Äôve heard, about monsters, about nightmares, legends whispered around campfires‚Ä¶all the stories are true.‚Äù

I basically just had to force myself through this one. It was like practicing a violin run: Just lift your finger. Play the note. Just play the notes. I just had to make myself get through it.

The feeling I had when I finished this book? Relief. Sure, there were some parts of it that I enjoyed. But I couldn‚Äôt get over how literally every aspect of the book was bugging me. I just couldn‚Äôt. The ending was‚Ä¶it left me completely lost. And not in the ‚ÄúI-want-to-read-more‚Äù sense, more like the ‚Äúwhat-am-I-even-reading‚Äù sense. I just wanted it to be over.

So, was it the worst book I‚Äôve ever read? No. (My review sounds pretty salty but the lack of cuss words indicates that I‚Äôm not furious)

Would I read the series? Also no. I was considering it because everyone I know is super obsessed with this book and everyone was hyping the rest of Cassandra Clare‚Äôs writing, but I just could. Not. Read. This. According to my friends, the second book is even slower than this one. And this one dragged. So no, I‚Äôm unlikely to read any more of the Mortal Instruments. And I probably won‚Äôt read the Infernal Devices (is that even the right series?) because I don‚Äôt want to go on to the second series without reading the first."
449,Nandakishore Mridula,The Little Prince,"Sep 14, 2011",5,"I have read only three books which I felt were magical: One Hundred Years of Solitude, To Kill a Mockingbird and this one. However, what separates this from the other two is that this is a book for all ages.

There was a magazine called ""Imprint"" (now defunct) during my childhood, in India. It used to publish literary articles and stories. My father got official copies and he brought them home regularly. One issue contained this story, and he gave it to me for reading. I was maybe 10-12 at that time.

It left an indelible impression on my mind: I was sad for the little prince and his proud rose, and constantly worried whether the goat would eat it. I chuckled at the silly grownups on the various planets, following their inane pursuits. I was sad when the fox and the prince had to separate, after he had tamed it. And I broke down and cried at the end.

I read this book again after a long time... and suddenly realised that I had become one of those adults on the asteroids. I was still sad after reading it-but now the sorrow had a deeper meaning. It was the death of childhood that I was reading about.

This book is an absolute treasure.

Postscript

July 22, 2015 - I gave this book to my son a couple of days back. Hopefully he'll read it - he has yet to fully transform into a silly grown-up."
450,Martine,Dracula,"Aug 05, 2008",3,"'Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely. And leave something of the happiness you bring!'

These are pretty much the first words spoken to Jonathan Harker, one of the heroes of Bram Stoker's Dracula, upon his arrival at Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania, just minutes after a nightmare journey through the landscape of gothic horror: darkness, howling wolves, flames erupting out of the blue, frightened horses. Within a few days of his arrival, Harker will find himself talking of the Count's 'wickedly blazing eyes' and 'new schemes of villainy' and have some hair-raising encounters with the man who is now the world's most famous vampire: 'The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me, with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of.' Several adventures involving sharp teeth, mirrors, garlic, crucifixes, bloody-mouthed corpses and big stakes will ensue. 

The above quotations should make it abundantly clear what kind of book Dracula is. It's sensation fiction, written nearly half a century after the heyday of that genre. It's a cross between an epistolary novel, a detective novel and a save-my-wife story, and it's full of scares, horror and disgust, all described in a lurid tone that befits the subject: the living dead. Or the Un-Dead, as the book's other hero, my countryman Van Helsing, calls them.

Sadly, Van Helsing is one of my main problems with the book. While I love his heroism, his 'Let's-do-it' attitude and his unceasing struggle for Mina's soul, I find him entirely unconvincing as a Dutchman. I wish to God (with a crucifix and everything!) that I could switch off my inner linguist and appreciate the story for its narrative qualities rather than its linguistic aspects, but Stoker has Van Helsing indulge in so many linguistic improbabilities ('Are you of belief now, friend John?') that it quite took me out of the story, again and again and again. I'm aware this is not a problem that will bother many readers, but I for one dearly wish Stoker had listened to some actual Dutchmen before making the hero of his story one. Then perhaps he also would have refrained from making the poor man mutter German whenever he is supposed to speak his mother tongue. ('Mein Gott' is German, Mr Stoker. I mean, really.)

Linguistic inaccuracies aside (there are many in the book), Dracula has a few more problems. For one thing, the bad guy doesn't make enough appearances. Whenever Stoker focuses on Dracula, the story comes alive -- menace drips off the pages, and the reader finds himself alternately shivering with excitement and recoiling in horror. However, when Dracula is not around (which is most of the second half of the book), the story loses power, to the point where the second half of the book is actually quite dull. In addition, the story seems a little random and unfocused. Remember the 1992 film, in which Dracula obsesses about Mina Harker (Jonathan's wife) because she is his long-lost wife reincarnated? That conceit had grandeur, romance, passion, tragedy. And what was more, it made sense. It explained why Dracula comes all the way from Transylvania to England to find Mina, and why he wants to make her his bride despite the fact that she is being protected by people who clearly want him dead. In the book, however, Mina is merely Jonathan's wife (no reincarnation involved), a random lady Dracula has sunk his teeth into, and while this entitles her to some sympathy, it lacks the grand romantic quality the film had. I guess it's unfair to blame an author for not thinking of an improvement film-makers later made to his story, but I think Stoker rather missed an opportunity there.

And then there's the fact that Stoker seems to be an early proponent of the Robert Jordan School of Writing, meaning he takes an awful lot of time setting the scene, only to end the book on a whimper. The ending to Dracula is so anticlimactic it's rather baffling. Did Stoker run out of paper and ink? Did he want to finish the story before Dracula's brides came and got him? I guess we'll never know.

Still, despite its many flaws Dracula is an exciting read (well, the first half is, anyway), and Stoker undeniably left a legacy that will last for centuries to come. In that respect, Dracula deserves all the praise that has been heaped on it. I still think it could have been better, though. Much better."

452,Hannah Greendale,Anne of Green Gables,"May 24, 2017",5,"Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.

Eleven-year-old Anne Shirley is an orphan girl in need of a family. She may be scrawny and freckled with red hair but she‚Äôs also loving and bright with imagination. When she‚Äôs mistakenly sent to Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, elderly siblings who plan to adopt a young boy to help around their farm, Anne faces the prospect of securing a home and a loving family ‚Äì if she can prove she‚Äôs worth keeping. 

First published in 1908, Anne of Green Gables has long enchanted readers, young and old alike. How could it not with such an effervescent heroine at its heart? Anne is a delightful companion with which to explore the splendor of Green Gables and the quaint town of Avonlea (a fictional town modeled after Montgomery‚Äôs hometown of Cavendish in the maritime province of Prince Edward Island, Canada). Montgomery crafts such stunning descriptions of the terrain that her prose risks outshining Anne. With descriptive language that titillates the senses and the imagination, Montgomery brings the rustic setting of Avonlea to life. Gypsy winds, perfumed air, dew-wet ferns, woodland blooms, and trees adorned with glimmering gossamer are just the beginning of the wondrous discoveries made by Anne during her ‚Äúraptured voyages of exploration.‚Äù 

It was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads, with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom. The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple. 

Wild cherry trees and rose bushes grow unfettered, and the birds are always singing, but one gets the sense that Anne Shirley could find happiness and adventure no matter where she goes, whether she be surrounded by beauty or not. Even though Anne‚Äôs story is recounted through an omniscient narrator, readers experience wonder of the world as if through Anne‚Äôs eyes. At every turn, her personality overflows and her indomitable spirit knows no bounds. She‚Äôs an eloquent child with an adoration for big words; ‚Äúif you have big ideas,‚Äù Anne insists, ‚Äúyou have to use big words to express them.‚Äù She speaks in a refined manner that belies her age and can always be counted on to impart wisdom. 

You can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will.  

Anne is a loquacious child with long-winded stints of dialogue. This trait was less noticeable when reading the book as a young girl and proved slightly annoying during this re-read as an adult. It‚Äôs a defining quality of Anne‚Äôs personality, however, something one cannot help but eventually love about her. There‚Äôs a comforting predictability to Anne‚Äôs bubbling personality; readers can always be certain that her uplifting thoughts and sophisticated proclamations will boil over and spill from her mouth with abandon. Matthew Cuthbert, much to his own surprise, finds Anne‚Äôs chatter quite pleasant. 

Like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. Be he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. 

Matthew Cuthbert is described as an ‚Äúodd-looking personage‚Äù with an ‚Äúungainly figure.‚Äù He‚Äôs a shy, quiet man who is made uncomfortable by most women, taking exception only to his sister and their gossipy neighbor who lives a quarter-mile away, Mrs. Rachel Lynde. 

Women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word. 

He‚Äôs quite taken aback to discover a girl in place of the boy he expected to retrieve from the train station, but he‚Äôs too kindhearted (and too cowardly) to leave her behind. He decides to escort her back to Green Gables so that his sister can ‚Äútell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake.‚Äù 

Marilla Cuthbert exudes none of the warmth found in her brother. She‚Äôs a practical woman, tall and thin ‚Äúwith angles and without curves,‚Äù who furrows her brows at wastefulness and excess. 

Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously. 

Marilla insists that Anne be returned to the orphanage. When Anne asks if Marilla would keep her if she were a more attractive child, Marilla replies simply, ‚ÄúNo. We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A girl would be of no use to us.‚Äù Despite her stern countenance, Marilla agrees to accommodate Anne for the night and decides that, rather than sleep on the couch prepared in the kitchen chamber for the anticipated boy, Anne should sleep in the east gable room. 

While Anne sleeps, Matthew and Marilla discuss what to do about the ‚Äúodd little figure‚Äù with the ‚Äúlong braids of red hair and the eager luminous eyes.‚Äù Marilla is quite determined not to keep her, while Matthew reveals he‚Äôs already warming to Anne‚Äôs irresistible charms. 

‚ÄúMatthew Cuthbert, you don‚Äôt mean to say you think we ought to keep her!‚Äù 
Marilla‚Äôs astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had expressed a predilection for standing on his head. 
‚ÄúWell now, no, I suppose not ‚Äì not exactly,‚Äù stammered Matthew, uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. ‚ÄúI suppose ‚Äì we could hardly be expected to keep her.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI should say not. What good would she be to us?‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe might be some good to her,‚Äù said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly. 

And therein lies Anne‚Äôs challenge: She must make herself useful around the farm and prove herself worthy of a home at Green Gables by staying out of trouble. But Anne and trouble go together like spring flowers and honey bees. Be it contending with Marilla‚Äôs practicality, navigating the politics of a new school, solving the mystery of pesky boys, or trying to make new friends as an ungainly orphan girl, trouble is never far behind the efforts of Anne Shirley. 

If Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert can find it in their hearts to cherish this little girl, their lives will be made richer for it. And if Anne can stay out of trouble, she might just find a loving home in a beautiful place. 

With lovely prose and an unforgettable heroine, Anne of Green Gables is an endearing book brimming with scope for the imagination."
453,Grace,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Nov 04, 2009",2,"Again, I can't do epics. I will watch the movie rather than read this again any day of the week. The writing's very dense, and it's clear that Tolkien was a major history buff. He's created a world that is fully, fully fleshed-out. He probably could have written you a tome that details every moment of Middle Earth for 5000 years (which may be ""The Simarillion"", actually -- I don't know, I only made it fifty pages into that one). 

But I just don't have the patience for it. After reading these as a teenager, I've not really been tempted to go back. And each time I try, I'm quickly dissuaded; I'd rather read a new adventure than re-read an adventure I remember quite well. It's different with someone like Philip Pullman, whose writing is some sort of catnip to me. Tolkien just doesn't strike the same chord, so all hail Peter Jackson, and I'm afraid the books have largely been relegated to display-only on my bookshelf."
454,emma,Brave New World,"Dec 19, 2021",3,"I would like to be an intellectual.

In an ideal world, I wear a monocle, and I have a pocket watch on a chain, and all of my sweaters have elbow patches. In this world, I consume exclusively classics at a very slow pace (so as to examine every word), but somehow simultaneously I have read everything that's ever been called worth reading by any person who's ever been called pretentious.

But that is not this world.

To be fair, I AM trying. I read literary fiction the most of any genre. I used to have a quest where I would have to read at least one classic every month, but I retired it because I typically read more than that. (Last year, for example, I read 46. And granted I have a loose definition of ""classic,"" but still.) I tend to rate books from those two categories higher than others.

But still, we find ourselves here.

I didn't like this book. I can say there are a lot of reasons, and I can even tell the truth: I can say that the depiction of women in this was so offensive it turned around and became funny and absurd, or that this dystopian world is not nearly as prescient as 1984's, or the Handmaid's Tale's, or even goddamn The Hunger Games', and both of those would be fairly respectable criticisms that I do have.

But that isn't completely accurate.

I didn't like this because it felt silly and boring.

That's really all.

Bottom line: I'll try to be smart next time.

455,Ellen,Wuthering Heights,"Jul 02, 2008",1,"I never expected this book to be as flagrantly, unforgivably bad as it was.

To start, Bronte's technical choice of narrating the story of the primary characters by having the housekeeper explain everything to a tenant 20 years after it happened completely kills suspense and intimacy. The most I can say is that to some extent this functions as a device to help shroud the story and motives from the reader. But really, at the time literary technique hadn't quite always gotten around to accepting that omnipotent 3rd person narrators are allowed, so you'd have to have a multiperspective story told by an omnipotent 3rd person narrator who was actually a character in the story (e.g. the housekeeper Ellen). The layers of perspective make it annoying and sometimes impossible to figure out who is telling what bit of story; and moreover, because so much is related as two characters explaining things between themselves, the result is that we rarely see any action, and instead have the entire book explained in socratic, pedantic exposition.

The sense of place is poorly rendered and almost entirely missing. Great, the moor is gray.

But ultimately, the most damning thing is that the characters are a bunch of immature, insuffrable, narcissistic assholes with very little self respect. This isn't a story of great love and passion. It's the story of how child abuse perpetuates itself through the generations. The characters are either emotionally abused as children or, as in the case of Cathy I, they're spoiled and overindulged with no discipline and can't muster the restraint and self-respect to ditch abusive relationships. I kept waiting for any of the characters to be remotely worth my time, but I found no respite from the brutish abuse of the horribly twisted Heathcliff or from the simpering idiocy of Cathy I and II. Ugh. Not only are there no transformations or growth, but the characters aren't even that likable to begin with. How this book got to be a classic is beyond me."

457,Lyn,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Dec 30, 2018",3,"A pleasing mix of Great Expectations and Little Orphan Annie but all mixed up in Japanese Geisha society.

Full disclosure: I, like many westerners, believed that geisha were a high end version of prostitutes. Sophisticated, talented and very excessively priced ‚Äì but prostitutes all the same.

Golden‚Äôs book has afforded me some erudition and I now know that is not the full story ‚Ä¶ except, well ‚Ä¶ there are still some elements of prostitution in the story. The fictional geisha first person narrator describes her own role as akin to a mistress rather than a wife, with formal rules that for the most part established that a geisha was connected to her ‚Äúdanna‚Äù or patron. It‚Äôs all very complicated and I never fully understood what was going on. To be fair, looks like the intricate etiquette rules confuse many Japanese as well.

My usual genre is science fiction / fantasy so this was something of a departure for me, but honestly, the description of Japanese culture, particularly Geisha culture, might as well have been something dreamed up by Jack Vance or Robert Silverberg it was so alien to me.

Golden describes the ‚Äúmemoirs‚Äù of a fictional geisha, Sayuri, and her ascent to the role of geisha in a bildungsroman style. We also share in Sayuri‚Äôs animosity with rival geisha Hatsumomo and her complicated relationships with patrons and sponsors.

Entertaining and provocative, this also sheds light on a time and place, Japan before, during and after WWII."
458,Kemper,The Great Gatsby,"Sep 22, 2007",5,"Jay Gatsby, you poor doomed bastard. You were ahead of your time. If you would have pulled your scam after the invention of reality TV, you would have been a huge star on a show like The Bachelor and a dozen shameless Daisy-types would have thrown themselves at you. 

Mass media and modern fame would have embraced the way you tried to push your way into a social circle you didn‚Äôt belong to in an effort to fulfill a fool‚Äôs dream as your entire existence became a lie and you desperately sought to rewrite history to an ending you wanted. You had a talent for it, Jay, but a modern PR expert would have made you bigger than Kate Gosselin. Your knack for self-promotion and over the top displays of wealth to try and buy respectability would have fit right in these days. I can just about see you on a red carpet with Paris Hilton. 

And the ending would have been different. No aftermath for rich folks these days. Lawyers and pay-off money would have quietly settled the matter. No harm, no foul. But then you‚Äôd have realized how worthless Daisy really was at some point. I‚Äôm sure you couldn‚Äôt have dealt with that. So maybe it is better that your story happened in the Jazz Age where you could keep your illusions intact to the bitter end.

The greatest American novel? I don‚Äôt know if there is such an animal. But I think you'd have to include this one in the conversation."
459,Tadiana ‚ú©Night Owl‚òΩ,The Giving Tree,"Mar 08, 2013",2,Here's the book I really want to read:
460,Brina,Romeo and Juliet,"Dec 31, 2017",4,"Happy 2018, everyone! I thought I would get the year off on the right track by reading my first book for classics bingo in the group catching up on classics...and lots more. One of the squares on this year's board is to read a book published before the 18th century, and, because Romeo and Juliet is one of this month's group reads, I decided to mark off this square early. Way back in ninth grade, I read Romeo and Juliet. I happened to have a teacher who assigned us outside of the box assignments such as writing letters between the primary characters or keeping Juliet's diary. Thus, this Shakespearean tragedy remains more memorable to me than some of the other dramas I have read over the years. Yet, the play still warranted a reread through adult eyes so here I am, beginning 2018 by reading Shakespeare.

I will be the first to admit that I although I enjoy reading through modern drama, usually Pulitzer winners, Shakespeare is tough for me. The language I am able to slog through; however, most plots are dull and leave me with much to be the desired. The only dramas I enjoy enough to want to reread is The Merchant of Venice and MacBeth for their strong, female protagonists. Which, brings me back to Romeo and Juliet. Most people know the basis of the story, one that has been retold so many times that it is part of western vernacular. My favorite version of Romeo and Juliet is the musical Westside Story. The song that begins ""when you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way"" sets the tone for the entire musical: the Jets and Sharks just flat out don't like each other but they are loyal to members of their own gang until their last dying day. This plot comes right out of Romeo and Juliet which features the Montagues and Capulets of Verona who have been feuding for time eternal. Like its more modern counterpart, the Montagues and Capulets just flat out don't like one another no matter the circumstances. It has always been thus and no member of the leadership of either family has done anything to lessen the feud.

All these feelings of ill will change on one special night when young Romeo Montague is smitten with Juliet Capulet at a masked ball. The two instantly fall in love and do everything in their power to hide their romance from their feuding family members, parents included. I can understand why this is the play often assigned to fourteen year olds because what young teenager has not been smitten and thinks that he/she is in love. Combine this with the aspect of star crossed lovers who are going against the prevailing trends of society, and there are many directions that a teacher can go in while discussing this with students. Boys will like enjoy the dueling between members of the Montagues and Capulets and perhaps also the innuendo imagery that Romeo uses to describe Juliet whereas, perhaps, girls will swoon over the descriptions of Romeo and how he does everything in his power to marry and be with Juliet for all eternity. Reading through adult eyes and admittedly 21st century eyes, I enjoyed the plot myself as well as descriptions of Juliet. The star-crossed lover unique aspect of this play allowed me to read it quicker than I would with other Shakespearean drama that I find tedious to get through at best.

Despite the imagery and the storyline, Shakespeare's language was still a bore for me to read. The planning and plotting and long soliloquies made for heavy reading. The story of star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet and the consequences of their relationship could be completed in one to two acts. Yet, then the story would not be a Shakespearean five act timeless classic. Perhaps because I am reading this drama during the 21st century where people need information before it happens makes plays with more speaking than action too slow at times for modern readers. Even with modern literature, unless it is quality literary fiction, I find it sluggish to get through slow moving novels with little plot movement, and prefer those novels with shorter chapters. After rereading a number of Shakespearean plays over the past few years I have come to realize that unless there is a lot of plot development-- feuding, fighting, falling in love, illicit marriage, more fighting-- that it is a challenge for me to get through the text. Lucky for me that Romeo and Juliet contains the elements of a quality story so it is only the text that challenges me, not the story itself.

Shakespeare's story of star-crossed lovers remains timeless classic that has been redone many times over. Romeo and Juliet have made appearances in some form on Broadway plays to Hollywood movies including a modern version starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo. Without stretching one's imagination all that much, Romeo and Juliet even resurface in the Star Wars story during the prequel trilogy. Their imagery is everywhere in modern society and by telling of two feuding groups as a backdrop, Shakespeare created a tale that could relate to people across many places and times, from school groups to rival governments. Now that I got through my first book of the year I am excited to get a jump start on bingo and my other challenges, both in groups and personal ones. Whether I read another Shakespeare remains to be seen because at the end of the day, if there are no feuds, fights, star-crossed lovers, and other elements of a modern story, Shakespeare's long soliloquies are not really my taste.

462,Fabian,Little Women,"Dec 27, 2013",4,"Yes, yes. I AM a grown-ass man reading this, but I'm not even remotely ashamed. 

What I tried to do here was dispel the extra melodrama & embrace the cut-outs (fat trimmed out) of the Winona Ryder film. I was on the hunt for all the ""new"" (ha!) stuff that the regular person, well informed of the plot involving four young girls growing up (or in the case of Beth, not) never even knew existed. But it seems that the film did a great job not adding many more scenes than direly needed (like the Byrne-Ryder night at the opera scene-- it explains why she doesn't choose Laurie after all) nor taking indispensable scenes from the century-&-a-half old novel to the cutting room floor. Alas, there's a good reason why Entertainment Weekly once decreed that the film was a great comfort to all post-911 victims--a holistic healing to the nation as a whole. The story has no great battles to speak of... no violence, no terrible disasters. The minutiae is symbolic of fragile domestic existences... important & very fun to read about--this coming from a Bridget and Carrie Bradshaw fan of course. ""Little Women"" is at its core all about Old School American values, such as temperance, forgiveness, hard work. It has astute lessons aplenty--to rival even old Aesopus himself. Laurie and Amy have the best lines, & there are plenty of groans amidst cute vignettes and harsh but necessary life lessons--for Americans and non alike. This is relevant today, more so than ""On the Road"" or other so called ""quintessential American classics""--& that's a genuine plus. 

This one stands as outstanding soap opera theatrics woven intelligently with American history herself. Good stuff, like a wise mentor of American Lit would say. Also, mega appropriate for the season!

I'm not sure if I liked it, the writing style was pretty crude, but it kept me thinking.

This review is harmless, well mostly harmless.

I think that one of the things that one has to keep in mind while reading this book is that it was written in 1979. Having this important factor in perspective, it's quite astonishing the vision of Douglas Adams, the author, presenting a lot of visionary elements, starting with the very ""book inside the book"", I mean The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, since it's presented as an electronic book. which now it's a very common way to read a lot of books now. Also, he mentioned stuff like ""touch-sensitive screens"" that yet again, it's now something introduced in our daily lives. Science-Fiction, the good science fiction is defined by being visionary in the moment to be published and a fact, years later. Just like Verne's work predicting events like space rockets and nuclear submarines.


The President of the Universe holds no real power. His sole purpose is to take attention away from where the power truly exists...


Obviously, beside the mesmering tecnology stuff that he predicted, the signature style here is his remarkable sense of humor, SMART sense of humor. In literature and pop culture in general, there were been unforgettable examples of computers like the cold HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the noble K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider, also robots like the loyal R2-D2 from Star Wars and the logical robots from I, Robot short story collection. However, nothing of that can prepare you to the experience of meeting ""Eddie"", the Main Computer of the Heart of Gold spaceship or Marvin, the Paranoid Android. This is one of the best traits of Douglas Adams' wit in the development of artificial intelligence. I wasn't surprised since some months ago, I read Shada by Gareth Roberts but based on the Doctor Who's unaired script written by Douglas Adams where you find another priceless example of a computer with a personality that only Adams is able to develop. You laugh and laugh with them BUT not only because they's funny but also they are truly logical as artifical intelligences in their way to react to situations. Adams' impact of how presenting artificial intelligence can be found too in another novel of Doctor Who, Festival of Death by Jonathan Morris, where the author showed how well he learned Adams' lessons.


Resistance is useless!


I believe that Douglas Adams' involvement in the production of the iconic British sci-fi TV series Doctor Who as script editor and writer of three stories, it was fated since I found remarkable similarities on the premises of both works, this novel and the TV series. Both has a peculiar fellow who stole certain machine and along with companions is travelling around. So, it wouldn't a surprise that he got some inspiration since Doctor Who was widely known since 1963 specially on its native country, England. Of course, his participation on another British TV institution like Monty Python's Flying Circus was a relevant point for Adams to explode his humoristic potential.


To boldly split infinitives that no man had split before...


It's possible that people unfamiliar with Adams' work could think that since this is a novel with comedy, they could think that it can't be a ""serious"" science-fiction book. However, the brilliance of this novel is its capacity of offering smart humor while using scientific concepts like the theory of faster-than-light objects. Even you won't be able to fight against his priceless explanation behind the UFOs' sightings.

Without spoiling anything, I think that my only reason of getting off a star in my rating of this great novel was its lacking a proper closure. I understand that this the first book in a trilogy of five books (yes, you read correctly, it wasn't a mistake) so the adventures and mysteries will continue in the second book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. However, it was quite unsettling when you are having the time of your life reading it and the book just stopped to have words. I describe it like that since I didn't feel an ending. It was indeed just like the impossibility of not finding more words in the book. What I can give to Adams is that that was quite improbable but in my opinion, quite unlikely way to just ""ending"" this book. 

Certainly I want to read the rest of this great 
TRILOGY
 of 
FIVE
 books. (Yes, yet again, you read well, and it isn't a mistake)"
471,J.L.   Sutton,A Game of Thrones ,"Jun 20, 2016",5,"Even for someone who has watched the HBO series, George R.R. Martin‚Äôs Game of Thrones is an engaging and enjoyable read! The strength of Martin‚Äôs writing shines through in these pages. Each chapter is well-crafted. You know exactly how to picture the setting and you feel the desires and discontent of each chapter‚Äôs (POV) character. Watching how Martin develops characters, with all their flaws, keeps the story going as much or more than the ‚Äògame of thrones.‚Äô If you‚Äôre looking for new information in the book; however, you‚Äôre not likely to discover much. Definitely nothing that one could really classify as a surprise. 

In fact, it distracted me (for a while) that the two were so remarkably similar (scenes, dialogue, action all seemed to match). When there was a small conflict with the series, I found myself noting the difference. This often had to do with the age of the characters (they are younger in the book) or the description of a few of the characters such as Tyrion. In the end, however, I was swept up in this epic story! I liked the pace produced by the shifting perspectives. The one drawback to this approach (for me) came at the end. It somehow didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd finished anything. The last chapter was a good one, but because there are so many perspectives and everything is still in motion, (despite the deaths) you don‚Äôt feel that anything has really ended. In fact this is true; the ending of book 1 is really just the beginning of Martin‚Äôs epic. 4.5 stars!"
472,Julia Ash,Dracula,"Mar 22, 2018",5,"A classic literary masterpiece!!! 

Here's an example of Stoker's writing, from Jonathan Harker's journal shortly after he was taken prisoner by Count Dracula in his castle:

""I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness.""

and then...

""But my feelings turned to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down, with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings.""

add to this...

""I saw fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.""

Wow! What writing. I gave this five stars, I mean, who wouldn't? It is also in my favorites bookshelf. A must read for classic horror."
473,Baba,The Da Vinci Code ,"Jan 17, 2020",2,"The literati: ""The Da Vinci Code is simply a poorly written thriller with a controversial hypothesis about the life of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church.""
Millions of readers: ""I am obsessed with The Da Vinci Code"". 

Literati: ""now go and get a very well written thriller with key themescentred around the human existence"".
Millions of readers: ""cheers, but no thanks...we've just ordered the first book in the Robert Langdon series"". 

For all those that lambast The Da Vinci Code's writing, grammar, depth etc. maybe they finally realised what many readers could have told them (if they'd ask), that maybe the key component of a story, is the story? And that's Dan Brown's winning play in this convoluted secret (faux) history uncovered adventure with over-the-top antagonists, he gives us a story that could touch all our lives, and to a degree that we care about. Hey, and it got millions of people interested in Fibonacci Numbers; and in reading in general :) On first reading it's pretty gripping but by my third (this) read the bending of so many facts and or inclusion of so many conspiracy theories takes the gleam of the story for me, to be honest, so a Two Star, 5 out of 12 from me.

2004 read; 2005 read; 2022 read"
474,Maggie Stiefvater,The Help,"Jan 26, 2010",5,"So, it looks like THE HELP is turning out to be one of those novels that I love despite flaws. Nearly everyone in the world knows what this book is about (as I pen this review, it is at #2 in Amazon sales ranking) but I shall reiterate: it‚Äôs the story of three women -- two black, one white -- in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi, and how the two black maids work with the one extremely naive white young woman to write a book of their stories as ‚Äúthe help.‚Äù 

In the spirit of honesty, I should tell you that I didn‚Äôt want to read it. It sounded like it was going to hit the Maggie Trifecta of Doom:

1) Fiction that is Good for You
2) ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Fiction‚Äù, now with 60% more tears
3) Mint Julep references* 

*I have not been thrilled by a single novel that mentions a mint julep. I‚Äôm not sure if this is coincidence. 

However, I loved it. Despite the fact that the book is massive -- pick it up next time you go by, it‚Äôs a doorstop -- I read it in three evenings. It was engrossing, very well characterized and often funny. Strangely enough, two of those are also part of what I consider its flaws. The characters are so reliably themselves that they are nearly caricatures in some areas. While it meant I could definitely never mistake one woman‚Äôs voice for another, it also gave it a bit of a Hollywood/ sitcom feel; they were types instead of people. And the funny -- well, race relations in ‚Äò60s Mississippi is not exactly all fun and mint juleps, as everyone knows. But this book is upbeat, uplifting, and ultimately made a bit fluffy by all its humor and optimism. Again, I could imagine this as a Hollywood screenplay in a New York minute. 

Still, don‚Äôt get me wrong -- it‚Äôs wonderfully written and easy to love and very easy to recommend. I also think it would be a killer book club book, because there is a lot to talk about in here, and I don‚Äôt just mean the Trifecta of Doom bits. I think that everyone who reads it will at least like it, even if it will not become their absolute favorite in the world. And we need books like that. So go out and read it.

***wondering why all my reviews are five stars? Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read. Consider a novel's presence on my Goodreads bookshelf as a hearty endorsement. I can't believe I just said ""hearty."" It sounds like a stew.***"
475,Debra,The Book Thief,"Dec 29, 2011",5,"This is my all time favorite book! I thought Zusak hit it out of the ballpark with this book. It was beautiful, it was sad, it was poetic. It was all things that books should be. It was simply divine. I actually read this very fast and then got mad that I read it so fast because I did not want it to end. I loved the characters. This book made me think, feel, cry and cheer for the characters. There is such beauty in this book. A must read for anyone who loves to read.

This book is set during WWII Germany and tells the story of Liesel Meminger, a foster girl living outside of Munich. Her younger brother has died and her mother has been ""taken away."" She has been taken in by a German couple who are scraping out a meager existence. Liesel learns to read with the help of her accordion playing foster father. She develops a love of books and cannot help stealing them when the opportunity presents itself. She forms a closed relationship with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau. Liesel also forms another close friendship with a boy who has hair the color of lemons, Rudy Steiner. Two people who will have an impact on her life. ""The Book Thief"" is narrated by Death. It's an unlikely narrator, but a very appropriate one for a book set during the Holocaust.

477,Debbie W.,Anne of Green Gables ,"Jul 31, 2019",5,"Why I chose to listen to this audiobook:
1. a cousin loaned me her copies of the first three books in this series back when I was only 13-years-old. I remember enjoying them then, but I wanted to refresh my memory before continuing on with the rest of this series;
2. it is available for free on Hoopla; and,
3. July 2023 is my ""O' Canada Month""!

Praises:
Author Lucy Maud Montgomery fleshes out her characters in a most heartwarming manner!
MC Anne Shirley - early on in the story, I had to empathize with this spirited young girl's unfortunate upbringing. I wonder if her overactive imagination was a matter of survival during her earlier neglectful years. I found her to be quite endearing with her dramatic, passionate and kindhearted qualities. Her descriptive love of nature and pure meditative joy over the most simple things helped me envision her natural surroundings. Even though adoptive guardian Marilla Cuthbert's sarcasm and criticalness and nosy, busybody neighbor Rachel Lynde's downright rudeness are perfect foils, it was satisfying to see how they were eventually won over by Anne's innocence. And although she held grudges at times, overall, Anne is a most winsome, delightful character!

Overall Thoughts:
Set on Prince Edward Island in the early 1880s, Montgomery used her childhood memories to write this classic. Her descriptive settings made me feel like I was a part of the Avonlea community.
One must be in the right frame of mind before reading this story. Don't expect a strong plot or villains set out to make Anne's life miserable. Written in 1908 with youngsters in mind, it is a lighthearted, pleasant read. 

Nostalgia at its finest!"
478,Matt,The Catcher in the Rye,"Jul 12, 2009",5,"I was worried as hell about reading this book again. The last time I read it was about a thousand years ago when I was just a kid. I was lousy with angst just like good old Holden back then. I really was. Now that I‚Äôm a crummy old guy I figured that I wouldn‚Äôt like it anymore. That‚Äôs the one thing about crummy old guys, they always hate books that kids like. Every time I reread a corny book that I really liked when I was a kid it makes me want to give the writer a buzz and ask what the hell is going on. It‚Äôs like they are trying to give you the time in the back of a cab when you don‚Äôt feel like getting the time at all. It‚Äôs damn depressing, I swear to God it is. If you want to know the truth, you probably couldn‚Äôt even talk to a phony writer on the phone. You would just end up talking to his butler or some snobbish person like that and asking if they would give the writer your message. He probably wouldn‚Äôt even do it. The thing with guys like that is that they will never give writers your messages. That‚Äôs something that annoys the hell out of me. 

Turns out this is still a damn good book. Salinger kid is a great writer. He really is. Maybe I‚Äôm still just an angst-ridden sonuvabitch, but this part kills me:

‚ÄúAll the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring, and so was old Phoebe, and I was sort of afraid she‚Äôd fall off the goddam horse, but I didn‚Äôt say anything or do anything. The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall off, but it‚Äôs bad if you say anything to them.‚Äùp.211

I‚Äôll bet everyone is going to think that I‚Äôm just horsin‚Äô around or trying to be all sexy talking like this. The reason for this corny review is because a thousand other people have already written reviews for this book and I‚Äôll bet that they have already said everything that I want to say. It‚Äôs pretty depressing. It really is. That‚Äôs about all that I‚Äôm going to talk about. Now I just hope that no one writes ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù on this review. That‚Äôs the thing with some people, they are always sneaking up and writing ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù on your book reviews when you are not looking. They really are."
479,Miranda Reads,A Game of Thrones ,"Oct 30, 2018",5,"Okay - I am SO incredibly late to this party but hey, I made it! And the hype was real! 
Winter is coming.
Lord Eddard ""Ned"" Stark lives with his family in a world where the seasons are thrown completely off - summers last decades, and winters are equally long. 

His five children, plus his bastard son (Jon Snow) are on the way back to their home, Winterfell, when they stumble upon and subsequently adopt six direwolf pups (the symbol of the Starks), with the albino runt going to John. 
When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives.
Upon returning home, King Robert Baratheon, an old friend of Ned, recruits the Lord to replace the adviser to the crown.

At first, he was hesitant but upon learning that the Queen Cersei Lannister may be behind the death of the previous adviser, he decides to go in order to protect his friend.

Unfortuntately, before he goes, Bran (Ned's youngest son) discovers that (view spoiler)[ the Queen is having an affair with her brother  (hide spoiler)] which results in Bran becoming crippled. 

Ned must leave his grievously injured son and travel with Sansa and Arya (Ned's daughters) to the King's Landing...where Ned realizes that the King has become ineffective and consumed by his love of drinking, gambling and hunting.

Meanwhile, tensions increase between the Starks and the Lannisters, especially between Joffrey, the crown prince, and the Stark children mount. 

And tensions further rise when it's discovered that Tyrion Lannister's dagger is the one found near Bran...which leads to Tyrion's abduction.

Meanwhile, Jon Snow volunteered to go to the Wall - a barrier surrounding the Seven Kingdoms made of ice an magic - under the impression that it is a brave and noble occupation...only to find out that it's a last-hope sort of place.
Nothing burns like the cold.
After a period of rough adjustment, Jon finds his place among the recruits only to discover something distinctly Other lives beyond these walls. 
Fear cuts deeper than swords.
Across the way, there is revenge on the air.

 Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen are the last living Targaryens - the old ruling family before King Robert Baratheon overthrew their father, murdered their family and banished them to poverty. 

Viserys is dead set on getting his kingdom back, and soon betrothed Daenerys, his thirteen-year-old sister, to Khal Drogo, a nomadic warlord with the promise of an army in exchange and three petrified dragon eggs for Daenerys.

Daenerys is terrified at first, but soon embraces her role as Queen of the nomadic tribes, even finding the courage to stand up to her brother. 

When Khal Drogo is injuried, Daenerys is forced to make the ultimate decision...

And, I finally get the hype but gosh dang, this one was a challenge to follow at times.

The plot jumped place to place to place, weaving together such an amazing world in such an exciting way...and yet with so many characters and scenes and NAMES for things that I kept having to Google what was what.

Even then, I was absolutely hooked by the complexity of both the characters themselves and the intricate politics that accompanied them...all with a heavy dose of magic and mayhem.

I loved the plot of Daenerys - the way she overcame her situation and ultimately ruled the clan was absolutely enthralling.

She was a small part of the overall plot, but I'm so excited to see where her character goes.

The politics, at times, became too much but every time I would get the least bit bored the plot would pick up and there'd be an absolute insane twist.

Such a good one - so excited for the next!

480,Elle (ellexamines),Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ,"Nov 26, 2016",5,"EDIT: I have close bonds with several transgender people, and I do not support this author at this point, as she actively uses her financial power to wreak havoc on the lives of trans people. 



‚≠êÔ∏èIn Defense of Harry Potter: Order of the Pheonix

So this is my second favorite book of Harry Potter. And I plan to tell you exactly why the fuck why. 

Order of the Pheonix is the most emotional book of the entire series, in a lot of ways. You have the visit to Neville's parents, Harry's ending breakdown as a character, the backstory behind Snape and Sirius... It deals with the deep emotional stuff in a way that the first few books didn't, with the possible exception of Prisoner of Azkaban. This book will make you cry.


‚≠êÔ∏èInterlude: In Defense of Harry's Angst Phase


Harry is an incredibly traumatized young adult who's just been isolated from every person who cares about him all summer. Literally every single person who cares about him. You try being dropped in that situation and not being upset, especially as a fifteen-year-old. But what really stands out here is Harry's character arc as he comes to be less angsty. This book took him to his bottom point and to his top and it's brilliant. 


Return To Actual Review


J.K. Rowling really nails down her tonal shifts in this book. The darker tone really takes this series to the next level in terms of plot AND character work. Order of the Pheonix is so dark and yet so hopeful. It's about resisting oppression in any way you can and it's just a perfect fucking book god I love this book so much 

The plotting is brilliant, incorporating one of the most terrifying villains I have ever read about in my entire life. She's so human and that's what makes her such a terrifying character. Also, the plot reveals at the end. The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville. 

The side characters and the entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here. There's something incredibly powerful in Harry Potter, who has worked alone the last few books, needing to ask for help. Harry realizes that he doesn't have to be alone. This book also deals with the fact that adults aren't perfect, even when they love you and want to help you. Also, Ginny Weasley is fucking perfect. Why do all of you sleep on her verbal DRAG of Harry? ‚ÄúI forgo‚Äì‚Äù ‚ÄúLUCKY YOU‚Äù 

This book is also undoubtedly the funniest of the series. Fred and George. The school resistance to Umbridge. I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort? IT UNSCREWS THE OTHER WAY.

This book is just fucking perfect. My mother is giving me annoyed looks while reading this review on her goodreads app but I don't care, this book is perfect."

482,Tadiana ‚ú©Night Owl‚òΩ,The Princess Bride,"Mar 08, 2013",5,"One of my all-time favorites! Long before the movie existed, I stumbled across this book in my college bookstore. This cover spoke to my YA fairy-tale-loving heart:



So I bought it, without knowing a thing about the story. And the book was NOT what I was expecting. 

It was way, WAY better.

If you love the movie, read the book ... and don't let yourself get bogged down in the long, offbeat intro. (Skim it if you need to.) You'll get a lot of background history on the various characters, which can be extremely funny, and a little poignant. The movie is in large part very true to the book, but William Goldman has a dry, satirical sense of humor that doesn't entirely come through in the movie. (The part about the Greatest Kisses Ever cracks me up every time.)

But it's still about ""Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passions.""

And it's wonderful."

full review

I had been meaning to read this book for a long time, but I finally did it based on a friend‚Äôs (hi Dario) insistence. It took me way longer than expected to finish it, and once I managed, said friend requested (in all caps) a text-message review. Here is that unaltered review for your perusal.

Message 1: I THOUGHT IT WAS MOSTLY A VESSEL FOR A CERTAIN LINE OF THINKING

Message 2: WHICH WAS CARRIED ACROSS IN GOLDSTEIN‚ÄôS BOOK AND O‚ÄôBRIEN‚ÄôS DIALOGUE AT THE END

Message 3: AND WHILE THOSE PASSAGES WERE SMART AND WORTHY OF PUBLICATION, THEY ULTIMATELY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE AS AN ESSAY

Message 4: BUT NOWHERE CLOSE TO AS MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE READ IT AS AN ESSAY

Message 5: anyway in the end i thought much of it was unnecessary but overall it‚Äôs a deeply impressive work

Message 6: i was lowkey astonished at how long the goldstein ‚Äúpassages‚Äù were

Message 7: but some of the ideas there were remarkable

Message 8: i found myself skimming at some points, and then i was mad at myself for skimming bc it‚Äôs like the whole point of the book, and then i was mad at the author for conveying the most important ideas in such a lazy way

Fin.

In conclusion, yes, I am the type of nightmare-person who responds to texts by breaking up sentiments into dozens of messages.

Sorry.

Bottom line: This was good but I wish it had been one or two political opinion papers instead! Sorry again!"
484,Warwick,The Alchemist,"Dec 20, 2012",1,"The problem with this book is not just that it's bad, which it certainly is, but that there are so many people out there who want to corner you at parties and tell you how it's totally changed their lives. In a way you might as well read it just so you can see how feeble-minded they must be to get any kind of philosophical nourishment out of this inexhaustible stream of clich√©s. The profound lessons you'll learn from this book amount to nothing more than several variations on the theme of ""only the very ugly is truly beautiful, only the very stupid are really intelligent, only black is white, only up is down"" etc etc.

The writing is too simple to be really bad, but it's the content that gets you. By the end of the book you'll want to track down the philosopher's stone yourself and carefully beat Coelho to death with it."

487,Hannah,Gone with the Wind,"Jun 25, 2009",5,"I don't like reviewing overly popular, classic books because let's face it, what more can be said regarding a book that 8,720 Goodreads reviewers haven't already covered, from 1 star through 5 star opinions?

So I'll just say that I read this novel for the first time when I was only about 14 years old. And re-read it, and re-read it, and re-read it again several times until around age 18. And then I never picked it up again until age 48 (that's 30 years of reading silence for those of you mathamatically inclined...) Between 18 and 48 is a huge gulf of life and living that might make a re-read a very disasterous endeavor, and I know for a fact that for a few of my GR friends, it was just that, and they regret replacing the youthful memories of this book with more mature ones.

I understand their feelings. I wondered if my own would replicate them. I'm glad to say that didn't happen in my case.

Not that GwtW is an easy book to digest in this politically correct era. It's hard to convey just how cringe-worthy at times a book written in the 1930's by an American Southern writer about the American South during the Civil War can effect modern sensibilities. You have to read it to believe it. The racism, the language, the attitude is all there in black and white (pardon the pun) and they can't be ignored. Those views, those attitudes existed, and still exist for many in this country and all over the world.

I don't condone it, but for me personally, I give most books written before 1960 a little handicap going into them. Not every reader can, and that's OK.

The continuing strength of Mitchell's epic novel is in her capturing of a feeling of loss to a period, a people and a place. Some would argue that it's good this era has crumbled into dust, and I'll not argue the point with them. But as a Southerner myself, I have a deep love and appreciation for my place of birth, and understand the pride and loyalty Southerners take in their homeland, because I feel it very much. Mitchell's saga isn't so much the love story of Scarlett and Rhett as it appeared to me as a teen. The real love story is Mitchell's to her homeland. Warts and all. The writing is so lovely, so authenic. The feelings and expressions ring true. The character of Scarlett O'Hara is, IMO, one of the best drawn character studies ever penned. I used to hate her as a teen, but as an adult I found myself cheering her on in places, and understanding her selfish motivations more then I could have ever imagined. What that says about me I don't know, but Scarlett is a fighter, and a survivor, and I've got to admire her tenacity if not her moral fiber.

This book is a masterpiece. A flawed, uncomfortable masterpiece. I'm glad I re-read it.

489,Emily (Books with Emily Fox),1984,"Mar 29, 2017",3,I know this is a well loved classic and I definitely enjoyed some parts... but some times I found myself a bit bored :S
490,Clare Richardson,Twilight ,"Apr 29, 2008",1,"I hate this book. I will probably end up reading the rest of them, because if I don't, people that love this thing will think they can convert me if I just keep reading. (ETA (Jan. 2013): Never even remotely bothered to finish the series. I said that as a joke to begin with, and I did not finish the series. Did not finish them, not for irony's sake or for amusement's sake or as some kind of amulet to ward off kind-hearted Twimoms that would encourage me with ""they get better!"" I hope that clears that up for some folks that seem to have had a tough time with ""I did not finish them."" One last time for posterity: I can pretty much be defined as a Person That Would Be Caught Dead in a Dumpster Before Reading the Rest of These Damn Books. So long as we're all clear on that now, ONWARD!)

In short: the writing mechanics are atrocious. The dialogue is stilted and absolutely wretched. The characterization is bad-- loose, jumpy, and the progression is occasionally senseless. The main characters themselves are not compelling: selfish, shallow, lacking the deep thought that comes with true passion and love and instead leaping recklessly into stupid and deadly situations when anyone with a brain could see sixty other possibilities that should have been tried first.

I can't express my disgust for the relationship between Edward and Bella. It's not romance, it's not passion, it's not love. It's selfish idiocy at best. Bella as a character is insufferable: her self-sacrificing streak is not compassion, it's sheer stupidity. It's hormones. It's a bad, bad example for the teenage girls who read it. Bella's whole life is tied up in her boyfriend. She has no goals, passions, ambitions, or dreams besides wanting to be with Edward, who could kill her.

Edward's element of danger is occasionally compelling, but it's totally overshadowed by the fact that Bella is completely oblivious to it. She doesn't fear him at all, and that doesn't come off like love: once again, it comes off as total stupidity.

Edward. What can I say about Edward. There is nothing lovable about him except that he is apparently the most beautiful thing in existence. He's selfish: he stays near Bella when he knows he could lose control and kill her at any second. He's a creepy stalker: he watches her while she sleeps, before she even really knows him. He's volatile: his mood swings are insane and ridiculous. He's immature: for someone who's been alive for a hundred years, he doesn't seem to have gained much experience. He's controlling: he doesn't want to let her out of his sight for two seconds. (Granted, she's dumb enough to get herself killed if he does.) He's insulting: he treats Bella like an incapable, silly little girl. (Which he's right to, but I digress. It's still insulting.)

I understand that Bella's smell and that Bella herself are irresistible to him. But if he wanted the best for her, he'd stay away from her, period, the end. The story is stupid, the love story is bad, and if that's what Stephenie Meyer is preaching to teenage girls, I think it's pretty questionable. It's not just ""a fun read"". There are girls out there who want to be Bella and who want to find an Edward.

Anyway.

I think I might enjoy the story a lot more if Bella's head was not the one I had to spend time in while reading it. If I had to read one more description of how beautiful Edward is, I was going to choke a kitten. If it had focused more on the vampire family I would have been a lot more willing to forgive its faults. I thought Carlisle's and Alice's stories were really compelling, and Edward was finally accessible to me when he talked about Carlisle turning him into a vampire and how his family came to be formed, his life before Bella, etc. Some aspects of the vampirism were truly awesome: I found the idea that vampires can never sleep completely terrifying. That they never, ever get a break and never, ever get to rest... that is a wonderful and ghastly idea.

Entirely overshadowed by their flowery breath and the fact that they sparkle. Mothereffing ridiculous.

This is hardly the tip of the iceberg, but I'm trying to spare you at least a little."

well myself and my counterpart on the dumb bitch book club have finally finish this lovely book. i have so many feelings about it, but i wouldn't even know where to begin.

primarily, this book is what got me into fandom culture. i started my first youtube channel solely to discuss twilight, the books and the movies. and edward was my first real crush.

upon reread as a 24 year old adult, it's pretty easy to see the faults of this book and its characters. and unfortunately for most of the book i didn't feel that strong sense of attachment and nostalgia that i was hoping to feel. but once i read the epilogue it kind of all came rushing back. i'm so appreciative for this book and what it represents.

bella might be an idiot, but she goes after what she wants. something we could probably all do well to remember.

The separate parts were already there
Everything was already on the table, many authors had dealt with the different ideas Brown is mixing together, and finding and recombining conspiracy theories isn¬¥t that complicated. It¬¥s the mix of different topics that interest many people stirred together that make it entertaining for the ones who like art or thrillers, for atheists and religious people, for the ones interested in plot or characterization, it¬¥s just difficult to find someone who would immediately say that she/he isn¬¥t interested in one of the plot vehicles.

Uchronia, dystopia, or big history?
It doesn¬¥t just relativizes general history, but religious and political history in a way that makes it a prime example of the fact that history and holy texts are written by the winners. Widening the range, questioning the status quo, and making people skeptical regarding omniscience, commandments, and whatever is something of huge importance. Brown did more than Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens combined and multiplied could have done in centuries by reaching so many people and making them think about the legitimation of any kind of belief.

Religious fan fiction
Imagine many people would start writing fanfiction like that about different religious texts, expanding universes with new and alternative prophets, letting the whole thing collapse into a parody of itself within years.

Hard vs soft science
I tend to equate religious, economic, and political science texts for the simple reason that, as soon as there is one more truth, or in hard science, formulas, and equations, the others or even the own one must the wrong. The more open criticism and sarcastic to profound interpretations of all those one hit wonders are made by sophisticated, young people, the less power all of those charlatanries can generate in their stupid quest towards the one and only variation of reality they want to establish. 

Blasphemy in a (view spoiler)[ Why can¬¥t JC have a daughter, what¬¥s your problem dudes? It¬¥s so ridiculous, if any prophet would be a woman or, gosh, a lesbian (or even a gay male prophet), they would of course completely freak out even more. (hide spoiler)]

494,selin (hiatus),The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Sep 13, 2023",5,"this is one of the most beautiful books i‚Äôve ever read. not my favourite or best one, just beautiful. it is so simple but the writing, characters and quotes are just so incredible ü•π

i don‚Äôt know if i can explain it logically but there was just this feeling i get while reading this book and it was just like charlie‚Äôs quote; ‚Äúwe were infinite.‚Äù it‚Äôs like that thing you get while visiting your childhood house, going to a beach at sunset, looking at your best friend or just listening to a song that helped you get through a certain part in your life.

and charlie.. he is the most ‚Äòthis is me trying character‚Äô i‚Äôve ever read, he is trying to ‚Äòparticipate‚Äô in life by creating connections with people, but he is too timid about.. well, just life.

i‚Äôm trying to write a review that explains my thoughts but i can‚Äôt because i felt so much things and i don‚Äôt even know how to name them, i just can say that it was some kind of a ethereal experience. just look at this quotes:

‚ÄùI would die for you. But I won't live for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe accept the love we think we deserve.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes people use thought to not participate in life.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot everyone has a sob story, Charlie, and even if they do, it‚Äôs no excuse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am both happy and sad at the same time, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can't think again. Not ever again. I don't know if you've ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone loves each other, but no one really likes each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just sit there and put everybody‚Äôs lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love.‚Äù

i don‚Äôt know, it just feels like whole book is trying to say i love you and i understand you, it‚Äôs so fascinating that 200 pages can hold this much emotions. this review is such a mess just like me after finishing it üò≠

I can't believe this book was Favorite Book of 2011. I must not be part of the in-crowd! Oh well.

Review below...

I have questions. Once my questions are answered, maybe I'll move my overall ratings up from 2.5 stars to 3.5 stars. Here is the thing, If the world doesn't make sense to me, I'm not going to enjoy the book as much as I could enjoy it.

So, here are my questions-

Why, at the beginning, can Beatrice look in the mirror ONLY when her mom cuts her hair? What does her mom cutting her hair have to do with anything? She's not supposed to be vain so why would she care what is happening to her hair. 

When Tris (aka Beatrice) goes down the zipline from the 100 story building, she has to fall in the arms of her fellow Dauntless from 20 feet up. Who caught the first girl down the zipline?

So, is the food synthetic, artificial (from the beginning of the book) or is it fresh (from later in the book)?

Why is the marsh dried up, but they have a river, waterfall and of all things, a drinking fountain?

Why do you need a backup generator to run the elevator up but you clearly have electricity to run other things?

Isn't carbon dioxide a problem if you are really deep underground?

How is it the scientists can make microscopic transmitters but there is not enough material to finish paving the roads? They talked about not being able to finish the roads, not that they didn't desire not to.

Who runs the trains?

Why is tattooing and piercings a sign of being brave? It said somewhere that the dauntless were not the artistic ones? I know tattoos are painful, yes. I have them and yes, I had piercings as well. But seriously, a sign of overall braveness? I don't think so.

And finally....

(view spoiler)[Tris (aka Beatrice) is divergent. She fits into more than one faction and can't be mind-controlled (we learn that divergent people can't be mind-controlled at the end of the book). She is told to keep this secret from the very beginning of the book when she first learns that she is divergent. Why would any one care if she is divergent (can fit into more than one faction), if going into the faction is her own choice (regardless of what faction you test in).

It's the Erudite that eventually control the Dauntless through the mind control. But the people that told Tris to keep her divergent status a secret didn't know that the Erudite were trying to control the Dauntless. So, why would the people tell Tris to keep it a secret? Because it worked well in the story (later in the book) is the only reason I can come up with?  (hide spoiler)]

-	Fyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment 

(My raging, Raskolnikov-like conscious could not rest without warning you of potential spoilers ahead!)

The problem with being a high school student with average intelligence is that you can get fairly good grades with fairly minimal effort. It is an invitation to cut corners and utilize only one half your ass. This happened to me in English class. I'd sit back, take good notes, and bluff my way through various tests (this was back in the day before Google, when my family only had an AOL dial-up connection and all the answers, right and wrong, were on the internet). For these sins, I am now fated to read the classics long after I was supposed to read them. 

On the plus side, coming to the classics on my own volition has given me a better appreciation than having to read them with a figurative gun to the head. This has allowed me to enjoy certain works to a higher degree.

However, I don't think any number of years will allow me to appreciate or enjoy or even suffer Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. 

First published in 1866, Crime and Punishment is the excruciatingly-detailed psycho-epic about the murder of a pawn shop owner (and her sister). The murderer is named Raskolnikov. He is a former student living in a wretched little closet apartment. He is utterly unlikable: smug, arrogant, temperamental, condescending and self-delusional. Today, we would recognize this person as having a serious mental illness (and the book would be called Inability To Form Criminal Intent and Involuntary Commitment instead of Crime and Punishment). Dostoevsky, though, presents Raskolnikov's malady as spiritual, rather than mental. In a way, he is just like every grad student you've ever met: shiftless; over-educated and under-employed; haughty, yet prone to bouts of self-loathing. I imagine if this book was written in the next century, Raskolnikov would have shaggy sideburns, wear a t-shirt emblazoned with Che's image, and have a well-hidden addiction to prescription pain pills. 

Raskolnikov has some interesting theories. He's a Nietzsche-inspired proto-Nazi who believes that the world can be divided into two classes: an elite, Napoleonic class, free to do what they wish; and a second class comprised of everyone else. This former class, because of their elevated standing, don't have to follow the rules. 

Armed with this self-serving worldview, Raskolnikov, in need of money, determines that the pawn broker Alyona Ivanovna is a louse who deserves to die. So he takes his axe and a fake pledge to her apartment and bashes her head in. The crime is suitably graphic: 

He took the axe all the way out, swung it with both hands, scarcely aware of himself, and almost without effort...brought the butt-end down on her head...Because she was short, the blow happened to land right on the crown of her head. She cried out, but very faintly, and her whole body suddenly sank to the floor, though she still managed to raise both hands to her head...Then he struck her again and yet again with all his strength...Blood poured out as from an overturned glass...

Once the murder is complete, very early in the novel, the long, slow, excruciating psychological unraveling begins. Some of Raskolnikov's madness is displayed through seemingly-endless internal monologues. Is this what it's like to be a crazy person? Maybe, maybe not. But it's effective in its way, because it drove me insane reading it. 

Raskolnikov's deterioration is also presented via his relationships. Despite being an utter jackass, he has a lot of friends and family who care for him. Among them is the doting Natasha, a housekeeper at Raskolnikov's apartment; a doctor named Zossimov; and Raskolnikov's ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù Razumikhin, who is a bit like Milhouse from The Simpsons, though a bit more refined. He looks after Raskolnikov, tries to get him a job, and suffers all Raskolnikov's verbal abuse with unflagging patience. I couldn't decide what annoyed me more: Raskolnikov's monomania or Razumikhin's spinelessness. 

Complicating this picture are several uninteresting plot threads that eventually, finally, after hundreds of pages, merge. One thread deals with Marmeladov, a wrecked old drunk whose daughter, Sonia, is a prostitute (with a heart of gold!). Raskolnikov is eventually redeemed by Sonia and Sonia's faith. A second thread has to do with Raskolnikov's mother and sister. His sister, Dunya, has come to St. Petersburg under a cloud, though things are looking brighter for her and the family, as she is engaged to Luzhin. Luzhin has money, and a keen eye for beautiful, vulnerable women. Raskolnikov rightly senses Luzhin's ill intent, and the animosity between the two men does not help Raskolnikov's troubled mind. 

On top of all this, there is a clever, Dickensian police inspector named Porfiry Petrovich. He knows immediately that Raskolnikov is the murderer, yet insists on playing a lame game of cat-and-mouse. One of the few enjoyments I got from this novel was the cold irony of a Russian police officer patiently waiting for his suspect to confess. In Dostoevsky's Russia, the law is clever, intelligent, and implacable. Of course, just a few decades later, the NKVD and KGB would be breaking down doors in the middle of the night and hustling people off to Siberia for no reason at all. 

To Dostoevsky's credit, all these characters intertwine, and all the stories pay off, such as it is. In order to do so, however, there are plot contrivances piled atop plot contrivances. Dostoevsky relies heavily on characters overhearing important bits of information. 

The only Russian novels I've read have been by Tolstoy, so I don't have much to compare this to. I'm not fit to analyze Crime and Punishment against other works of Russian literature, or even against Dostoevsky's other books. All I know was that this was a drag to read. There are paragraphs that go on for pages, and the density ‚Äì unleavened by any action ‚Äì is numbing. 

One of the most common complaints when reading Russian literature is the names. It's almost become a clich√©. Well, in this case, it's true. At least ‚Äì for the benefit of English speakers ‚Äì Tolstoy gave his characters American nicknames. Here, you have to deal with both the patronymics and identical-sounding or near-identically-named characters. The easiest task you have is not mixing up Raskolnikov with Razumikhin. It gets a little harder trying to keep Alyona Ivanovna (the pawnbroker), Katerina Ivanovna (Sonia's mother) and Amalia Ivanovna (Sonia's mother's landlord) straight. Also remember that Dunya goes by the name Dunechka or Avdotya Romanovna (but that Porfiry Petrovich is not the same as Ilya Petrovich). These complaints are childish, I know, and I have no excuse. Yet I feel the need to unburden myself now, as I missed my chance in high school many, many (many, many) years ago. 

More confusing than the names is the culture shock. When I first tried to read Crime and Punishment as a teenager, I chalked my confusion up to a poor translation. Well, this time around, the translation is in the incredibly capable hands of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. They managed, in Anna Karenina and War and Peace to be both faithful and readable. (They are recognized, by people far smarter than me, as the best Russian-to-English translators around). 

Here, again, I have no complaints with the translation; but I also had a revelation: I don't get Russians. I don't fully grasp their social hierarchy; I don't get why they like mustaches on women; and I certainly don't understand their interactions. They get mad for reasons I can't comprehend; they are insulted for reasons I do not fathom. In Dostoevsky's hands, Russians are hopelessly operatic, incapable of having a subtle or nuanced reaction to anything. Every emotion has an exclamation mark. You get Dunya trying to shoot Svidrigailov one second, and then tearfully embracing him the next. Characters fall on their knees before each other, and laugh at inappropriate times, and have opaque motivations. I am not trying to be culturally insensitive when I say I am confounded by the Russians in Crime and Punishment. 

Of course, there are enjoyable moments, including a classic set-piece following Marmeladov's funeral (imagine a Russian version of Clue, in which accusations are followed by counter-accusations, and everyone is shouting and fainting). Surprisingly, there is also a good bit of humor, such as this interaction between Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov regarding the morality of eavesdropping: 

In that case, go and tell the authorities; say thus and so, I've had this mishap: there was a little mistake in my theory. But if you're convinced that one cannot eavesdrop at doors, but can go around whacking old crones with whatever comes to hand, to your heart's content, then leave quickly for America somewhere!

When I was young, I often gave up on challenging books like Crime and Punishment. If I managed to finish ‚Äì or at least come close ‚Äì I treated them with snark, which was obviously a self-defense mechanism, hiding an unspoken belief that maybe I just wasn‚Äôt smart enough to get it (whatever it was). When I got a little older ‚Äì when I was no longer a kid, but didn‚Äôt have kids of my own ‚Äì I went back to those classics I had dismissed, as a way to test myself. Older still ‚Äì with kids of my own who don‚Äôt have their own kids ‚Äì I circled back again, a strange sort of revisiting in which I tried to remember my past self through literature. Sometimes, I found myself revising old opinions. The Scarlet Letter, for instance, worked for me as an adult in a way it never had when I barely skimmed it in my youth. 

Crime and Punishment, however, is never a classic I am going to love (and I‚Äôm unlikely to give it another try). Yet, in the perverse way of classics, it is utterly memorable, if only because I struggled so hard to get through it. Believing this a worthwhile hill to climb, I did not give up, even though I could have finished three others books in the time it took me to slog through this one. Heck, despite not liking this the first time, I even gave it an entire second reading. Thus, even though I can‚Äôt stand it, Crime and Punishment will be somewhere in my headspace forever, a vague recollection of mustachioed women, strong emotional reactions, and a know-it-all with an axe."
497,Jeffrey Keeten,Brave New World,"Mar 12, 2012",4,"‚ÄùI feel I could do something much more important. Yes, and more intense, more violent. But what? What is there more important to say? And how can one be violent about the sort of things one‚Äôs expected to write about? Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly--they‚Äôll go through anything. You read and you‚Äôre pierced.‚Äù

Aldous Huxley was prompted to write this book in the early 1930s because he feared the direction society was heading. The worship of material goods, the embracement of capitalism, the promiscuity, the growing ambivalence towards books, the self-medication to escape reality, and the overall vacuousness of people, in general.

The book begins rather awkwardly in the lab where people are being created. A massive, industrial, test tube baby factory with very little variety, after all, they have determined the very best specimens so why create anything else? Note to self: rewatch the movie Gattaca. We do meet Lenina in the lab, an uncommonly pretty woman, who feels a pat on a fanny by her supervisor is a reassurance that all is well. Note to self: #metoo movement needs a time machine. 

Huxley read a book on Henry Ford, who was certainly the poster child for industry and capitalism. In this book, he has become a deity of sorts. ‚ÄùOh for Ford‚Äôs Sake!‚Äù a character thunders. Note to self: Start using Ford for Fuck and see if anyone has a clue where such a use of the word came from. 

‚ÄùWe don‚Äôt want people attracted by old things. We want them to like the new ones.‚Äù Rampant consumerism is the only way to keep the merry-go-round turning. Fortunately, by using brainwashing techniques while everyone sleeps, they can implant the proper desires and prejudices that will make for a united and happy society. 

Lenina has become hung up on a guy by the name of Henry Foster. She hasn‚Äôt been with another man for four months. She is dangerously close to being accused of monogamy. Her friend is appalled and reminds her that ‚Äùeveryone belongs to everyone else.‚Äù A woman being ‚Äúallowed‚Äù and even encouraged to be promiscuous would seem like evolution, but when it becomes an obligation to be promiscuous, it feels like just another form of oppression. Sex has become a plaything to keep the masses happy. 

They also have soma, which is the ultimate happy pill. Anytime things become too real, they pop a tab of soma or three. ‚ÄùChristianity without tears--that‚Äôs what soma is.‚Äù It bleeds all meaning out of life, leaving the user complacent and happy and completely oblivious to whatever had been bothering them in the first place. It feels more than a bit like the opioid epidemic that we are struggling with currently; only soma is made readily available to all who need it and seems to have been carefully manufactured to avoid overdoses. Overdoses would definitely be a downer that would create some of that much feared unhappiness. #opiodcrisis

What kind of life would it be to feel nothing?

Bernard Marx has been trying to get Lenina to do something with him for some time. He is a bit of an odd duck among these carefully designed people. A Danny Devito among a herd of Arnold Schwarzeneggers. Note to self: Rewatch Twins, just because it is such a hoot. There is much speculation that something went wrong in the lab, a bit too much of this or too little of that leaked into his test tube. Needless to say, he is testy about it. After all, why does he look like this while his siblings look like that? He finally convinces Lenina to go with him to an Indian reservation in America, where they meet the natives who have been untouched by technology. They get old. They get sick. They die young. They give birth. This is a #povertyporn trip similar to white westerns driving through African villages so they can point and say things like...can you believe people live like this? Bernard is there really to feel something. Lenina is there to become overcome by all the squalor and unfamiliar feelings of discomfort, but she is glad she came because she is going to rock her #Facebook page when she gets back. 

Bernard decides to bring a white Savage back with him. He is the product of a lustful coupling by Bernard‚Äôs boss, and believe me Bernard needs all the leverage he can get with his boss. The Savage is reading, not only reading, but reading Shakespeare. Can you imagine a person learning to read from Shakesepeare being integrated into an uneducated society such as this? Note to self: Read Othello. The Savage is primitive and a thinker, and this will prove to be a dangerous combination. He will see the absurdity in everything. He will protest violently...how dare he? 

‚ÄùO Brave New World!‚Äù

Can one man bring truth to the masses? It will be a nearly impossible task, given that the masses don‚Äôt even know they need saving. 

I had forgotten about all the humor in the book. Huxley is poking fun at nearly everything we hold sacred. Satire is the perfect vehicle for modern comedians like John Oliver, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, and Bill Maher to make their political points and make their audience laugh as well. We seem to need our truths given to us with a dose of sugar. Even in this futuristic utopia, Huxley called it a negative utopia, the population still needs healthy doses of soma to keep up the pretense that everything is fine. The people who rebel are those who find integration to be a problem or, like Bernard, feel disadvantages from the very beginning of their life. One size does not fit all, even when everyone is manufactured to be the same. A society will always be judged by the tolerance it shows for those different than the majority.

498,Tessa De Guzman,Animal Farm,"Aug 26, 2007",0,"Funnily enough, i read this book as a child and thought that it really WAS about animals. I remember thinking, Evil Pigs, I'm glad you're bacon in MY world, and Poor Hardworking Horsies, come live on my farm instead. You can have all the hay and makopa you want (sadly, no apples, tropical climate).

I reread it after education spoiled my natural inclinations for fast and absolute punishment of evildoers and eternal rewards for the good. I do find it pleasantly strange that these animals are symbols for political stereotypes and yet people still appear in the book. Isn't that CRAZY? That's literary perversion in a class all its own.

I'm thankful i read this in my formative years, before I had all this intellectual baggage (emphasis on baggage, piano on the intellect), because I got to appreciate it like a child would, almost like the way I appreciated Charlotte's Web. To me, back then, it was just another story about animals, albeit a wordy one, with no pictures.

Which is probably why I still experience a certain righteous thrill when eating crispy bacon."

So, I really really liked this book!! Of course, I loved Peeta!How can I not? He is perfect! 


But Katniss? Why?? She is so strong and bad-ass but she always misunderstands Peeta! It's so obvious that he loves her but she is in denial! She is so stupid!! And when she realizes his feelings, she just hurt him! Congrats!


4 stars because of Katniss' stupidity!


Let's start from the beginning!

What is Hunger Games?
Every year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 were selected from each of the twelve districts as tributes, who train for a week and then are sent into an arena to fight to the death.Only one tribute can win the games. This competition is showed to television to be seen by all citizens.

So, Katniss' little sister, Prim, is selected for the games, but Katniss took her place to save her. 


""I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute!""


The boy who was chosen to participate was Peeta Mellark, a boy who Katniss knew because she saved her from starvation and give her some bread as a result his mother beat him!


------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------

1) I loved Peeta! He protected her but I will admit she protected him as well! She risked her life to get the medicine needed to heal his leg. But how can she not see that he is madly in love with her? I loved it when he told her about her singing for the music class, that's when Peeta realized he was in love with her when he saw that the birds were listening like they did for her father.


‚ÄúNo, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew - just like your mother - I was a goner,"" Peeta says.‚Äù 




2)I think she has feelings for him deep down! Very deep. 


‚ÄúI don't want to lose the boy with the bread.‚Äù 

 
Sometimes when she kissed Peeta she felt guilty because of Gale! Why????He is her best friend! At the beginning, she said that she never saw him that way and now what? She is confusing me.
Please, not love triangle again!!I liked Gale but no! 


3)Curiously, I liked Haymitch! He won the Hunger Games of his time. He is also Katniss' and Peeta's mentor. It seems at first that he doesn't like Katniss very much but at the Hunger Games he helped her more than he helped Peeta. 


‚ÄúHere's some advice. Stay alive.‚Äù 




4)I also liked Cinna, their stylist. He always supported her in his way.


5)Rue! She was the 12-year-old female tribute from District 11. I really liked that Katniss allied with Rue. They were amazing together. But Rue died. 

I understand only one can win( our case two) but I felt so sad when she died. Not only her though. A lot innocent kids die because of the Capitol. It's not fair.


6)In the half of the games, it was announced that two tributes from the same district can win. So katniss and Peeta can be allies. But when all the other tributes died it was announced that the rule they said early has been canceled. I was so angry! They did it on purpose. Assholes!!!


7)When they announced it, Katniss aimed her bow at Peeta when she sees he has picked up a weapon, but he throw it into the lake. She is so stupid. He didn't want to fight her and she thought that he could kill her. 


8)I was scared when Peeta and Katniss threaten to commit double suicide so there will be no winner! But it was a trick. Thankfully, that trick worked and both PEETA AND KATNISS WERE WINNERS!


9)And the ending! Peeta discovers that Katniss was mostly acting during the games about the feelings. He was so heartbroken! My baby!


‚ÄúYou here to finish me off, Sweetheart?‚Äù 




P.S. I haven't seen the movie yet!"
501,Erin,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Apr 21, 2018",4,"I was scared to reread this book, I hadn't read it since I was in seventh grade and that was a loooong time ago. A Wrinkle in Time was the book I would read as a kid when I was in a bad mood or bored or just because I wanted to get wrapped up in the magic of another world. I read A Wrinkle in Time for the first time in second grade and it made me fall in love with reading. Of course I liked to read before then but this book turned me into the voracious reader I am today. So as I said before I was scared to reread this book after all these years given how much it meant to my childhood. I worried I wouldn't like it and I didn't want to destroy the memory of this book. 

So how do I feel after rereading it? 

I didn't love it as much as I did when I was a child but that was an impossible bar to reach. I have to admit I was very confused for the majority of the book. I don't know how I understood this book as a 8 year old when I could barely keep up as a 32 year old. I'm glad I reread it and I'm glad I didn't hate it. My childhood memories remain intact. Had this been my first time reading my rating would have been lower(2.5-3 stars) but since I probably wouldn't be the reader I am today or the woman I am today without this book 4 stars seems a fitting rating.

502,Lisa of Troy,The Lightning Thief ,"Nov 15, 2022",5,"Perfect for those who love mythology

This should come as no big shocker given that my pen name is Lisa of Troy, but I love Greek mythology. The problem with Greek mythology is that the language is so archaic that I usually spend more time reading the reference materials than the original text. 

Recently, there have been some efforts to modernize the myths and make them more accessible.

The Lightning Thief jumps right into action, no 100-page warm-up here. No droning on and on about Greek mythology. It is also highly readable with short paragraphs and sentences. 

One thing that I didn‚Äôt like is the portrayal of the Greek gods. In Greek mythology, the gods are heartless. No one is safe even children. This is one aspect that makes mythology so shocking; it doesn‚Äôt follow traditional social norms. The Lightning Thief is geared towards the YA audience, so I suppose Riordan made the right call in toning the book down a bit.

The Lightning Thief is so good that I picked up a buddy reader. I was listening to the audiobook on the couch (that happens more than you would think), and my family member started listening too. I kept asking if I could read the book by myself, and I kept being told, ‚ÄúNo! No! You have to wait for me!‚Äù We ended up reading the entire book in about two days.

Would I read the next book in the series? You bet!

503,Jeffrey Keeten,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Nov 28, 2013",4,"‚ÄùWhatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too soon they bleed into a wash, just like watery ink on paper. ‚Äú




Geisha Mineko Iwasaki basis for Chiyo/Sayori.

Chiyo, with her sister Satsu, and her mother and father live in a shack by the sea on the coast of Japan. The shack leans, and has to be propped up to keep from total collapse. Her mother is sick and on the verge of death. Her father is a fisherman, uneducated, and generally befuddled by anything that doesn‚Äôt have to do with his fishing nets. When a businessman from the village comes to them with an offer to take their girls to the city it doesn‚Äôt take much to convince the father that nearly any opportunity is better than staying there in the tilted shack by the sea. 

He was wrong. Or was he? Without a crystal ball or access to a series of timelines showing the variations created by changing key decisions at critical junctures how can we know? 

Satsu, who is fifteen, is promptly placed with a brothel. Not exactly what her father had in mind. I‚Äôm sure he was told she would be trained for ‚Äúdomestic service‚Äù. Chiyo, who is nine, is deemed young enough to be trained to be a geisha. She is a lovely child with startling rare gray/blue eyes. 



Those Blue Eyes are what set her apart.

The Mother of her geisha house is equally startling in appearance. 

‚ÄùInstead of being white and clear, the whites of her eyes had a hideous yellow cast, and made me think at once of a toilet into which someone had just urinated. They were rimmed with the raw lip of her lids, in which a cloudy moisture was pooled, and all around them the skin was sagging.‚Äù

Obvious a bit of a failing liver issue going on here, but wait she is really much more mugly. 

‚ÄùI drew my eyes downward as far as her mouth, which still hung open. The colors of her face were all mixed up: the rims of her eyelids were red like meat, and her gums and tongue were gray. And to make things more horrible, each of her lower teeth seemed to be anchored in a little pool of blood at the gums.‚Äù 

Okay so Chiyo lets out a gasp. She starts out her new life in trouble. 

It doesn‚Äôt end there. She is quickly considered a threat to the lovely and vindictive Hatsumomo who is the only fully trained geisha working for the house. Chiyo is accused of stealing (not true). She is accused of ruining an expensive kimono with ink (true but under duress). She is caught trying to escape ( she broke her arm in the process so try and give the kid a break). Well, all of this ends up costing her two years working as a housemaid when she could have been training as a geisha. 

She receives an unexpected benefactress, a mortal enemy of Hatsumomo named Mameha decides to take Chiyo under her wing and insure that she has another opportunity to become a geisha. 

Chiyo, tired of scrubbing floors and being the do-this and do-that girl of the household realizes her best chance at some form of freedom is to elevate herself. 




The Movie based on this book was released in 2005 and directed by Rob Marshall.

At age 15 her virginity or mizuage is put up for auction. It is hard not to think of this as a barbaric custom, but for a geisha, if a bidding war erupts, she can earn enough money to pay off all the debts that have accumulated for her training. Chiyo, now called Sayuri, is fortunate to have two prominent men wanting to harvest her flower. The winner is Dr. Crab who paid a record amount for the privilege.

‚ÄùOf course his name wasn‚Äôt really Dr. Crab, but if you‚Äôd seen him I‚Äôm sure the same name would have occurred to you, because he had his shoulders hunched up and his elbows sticking out so much, he couldn‚Äôt have done a better imitation of a crab if he‚Äôd made a study of it. He even led with one shoulder when he walked, just like a crab moving along sideways.‚Äù

Not the vision that any girl would have for her first time, but ultimately it is a business transaction that frees Sayori from the bonds of debt. After the deed is done, the eel spit in the cave, Dr. Crab brought out a kit filled with bottles that would have made Dexter jealous. Each bottle has a blood sample, soaked in a cotton ball or a piece of towel of every geisha he has ever treated including the blood from his couplings for their virginity. He cuts a piece of blood soaked towel that was under Sayori and added it to the bottle with her name. 

Ewwehhh! with a head snapping *shiver*.
The cultural obsession, every country seems to have one, with female virginity is simply pathological. Girls can‚Äôt help, but be fearful of the process. Not strapped to a table by a serial killer type fear, but still there has to be that underlying hum as the man prepares to enter her. I wonder if men, especially those who avidly pursue the deflowering of maidens, are getting off on that fear? I‚Äôve made myself feel a little queasy now. 

Sayori is on her way to a successful career. She is in love with a man called The Chairman and wishes that he will become her danna, a patron, who can afford to keep a geisha as a mistress. There are people in the way, keeping them from being together, and so even though there were many geishas who wished for her level of success she still couldn‚Äôt help feeling sad. 

‚ÄùAnd then I became aware of all the magnificent silk wrapped about my body, and had the feeling I might drown in beauty. At that moment, beauty itself struck me as a kind of painful melancholy. ‚Äú

It was fascinating watching this young girl grow up in such a controlling environment; and yet, a system that can also be very deadly. One misstep, one bit of scandal, and many geishas found themselves ostracized by the community. They could very easily find themselves in a brothel. During WW2 the geisha community was disbanded, and the girls had to find work elsewhere. Sayori was fortunate. Despite all the hardships I know she was enduring, Arthur Golden chose not to dwell on them in great detail. I was surprised by this because authors usually want and need to press home those poignant moments, so that when the character emerges from the depths of despair the reader can have a heady emotional response to triumph over tragedy. 

I really did feel like I was sitting down for tea with Sayori, many years later, and she, as a way of entertaining me, was telling me her life story. Golden interviewed a retired geisha by the name of Mineko Iwasaki who later sued him for using too much of her life story to produce this book. She even had light brown eyes not as striking as Sayori's blue/gray eyes, but certainly light enough to be unusual. I wonder if Iwasaki was still the perfect geisha, keeping her story uplifting, and glossing over the aspects that could make her company uncomfortable. 




Mineko Iwasaki

The book is listed in the 1,001 Books You Must Read Before You Die. It was also made into a film, which I‚Äôve been avoiding, knowing that I wanted to read the book first. I notice some reviewers take issue with Sayori. They feel she did not assert herself, and take control of her life. She does in the end, but she is patient, and waits for a moment when she can predict the outcome. I feel that she did what she needed to do to survive. Most of the time she enjoyed being a geisha. It takes a long time to learn not only the ways to entertain, but also all the rigid traditions that must be understood to be a successful geisha. As she gets older, and can clearly define the pitfalls of her actions, we see her manipulating the system in her favor.

504,Leonard Gaya,Brave New World,"Jan 31, 2015",4,"Brave New World is a young man's novel, written in the interwar years. Huxley was then living in a collapsing world: a world where the optimist 19th-century dreams of progress, of improved humanity, of a new and superior man, had been shattered in the trench warfare of World War I and were about to be burned amidst the horrors of the concentration camps.

Huxley seems to be sensing that grave danger is looming on the horizon, and he imagines a utopia where a single superstate is ruling the whole planet. The dream of a ‚Äúsuperior humanity‚Äù has eventually come true, thanks to the extensive use of eugenics and mass cloning (babies in bottles). Not all people get the best genetic formula, however: some of these manufactured humans are reduced to imbecility, perform the lowest functions, and are nonetheless content with their lot. Children, of course, are all brainwashed and conditioned with hypnotic techniques (sleep teaching). There are no families anymore, and sexual promiscuity is pervasive. Adults get a further supply of silly entertainment (Feelies) and drugs (Soma) that renders them docile, keeps them young, and make them love their voluntary servitude. People have lost interest in art and science, and religion has been replaced by Henry Ford‚Äôs cult (i.e. assembly line applied to human beings) and occasional orgiastic ceremonies (orgy-porgies). In short, humanity has achieved happiness and reached the End of History.

To some extent, Huxley‚Äôs prophecies have become a reality, less than a century later: rational, hierarchical, hyper-efficient and optimised capitalism and cheery consumerism have conquered most of the world. The sexual revolution has indeed taken place ‚Äî although full sexual libertarianism is still a pipe dream. Pharmacopoeia, narcotics, antidepressants, tranquillisers and rejuvenating treatments are broadly available; as well as irrelevant and mind-numbing 3D entertainment, peppered with commercial slogans. Genetic engineering and biotechnology are everywhere (although not used to select humans as yet).

Brave New World is a novel structured around a set of (rather crude) characters and plots; there is, however, no clear protagonist. Huxley has a witty tongue-in-cheek sense of humour throughout. Some passages even have a purely poetic or musical quality: particularly through the use of Shakespeare‚Äôs lines for the character of John Savage, or the cross-cutting technique employed in chapter 3. But by and large, the book feels like a philosophical essay or social satire, in the style of Voltaire‚Äôs Candide or Swift‚Äôs Gulliver's Travels. Obviously, Huxley had Plato‚Äôs Republic in mind, when designing his Alpha / B√™ta / Gamma / Delta / Epsilon caste system (he was probably also referring to the school grades: A+ to F, already in use when he was a pupil at Eton College, or even to the caste system in India). Certainly, he remembered Nietzsche‚Äôs ‚ÄúLetzte Mensch‚Äù from Zarathustra‚Äôs prologue: a human type that has indeed invented happiness, comfort and social stability, but ultimately a petty and lethargic sort of humankind. A type of humanity that might well be appealing to us right now, who knows‚Ä¶

Brave New World is obviously a fascinating political statement that spoke to the European crisis of the 1930s. But its visionary impact and influence on speculative fiction cannot be overstated, from Orwell‚Äôs 1984 to Bradbury‚Äôs Fahrenheit 451, to Atwood's Oryx and Crake, and to Houellebecq‚Äôs La Possibilit√© d'une √Æle.

See also my review of Brave New World Revisited.

Edit: Watched Universal‚Äôs 2020 TV series adaptation. It is by and large faithful to the novel‚Äôs plot and characters, but ends up taking more and more liberties as the episodes go by. It‚Äôs also focusing way more on the entertainment potential of the book (especially the erotica aspects of the orgy-porgies) than on the political debate around the problem of happiness vs freedom. All references to Shakespeare have been removed as well, although the romance is a central part of the show (not so much in the book). Ultimately, Huxley‚Äôs philosophical novel serves as the rib cage of the series, but its heart is more like Black Mirror, Westworld, The Matrix or even Fritz Lang‚Äôs Metropolis. Nonetheless, a pleasant ‚Äúfeely‚Äù with some nice eye candy!"
505,Matt,Dracula,"Oct 25, 2017",5,"This is a classic monster tale I have enjoyed before, but could not wait to revisit as the season is rife with haunted ghouls and bloodthirsty readers!

Young solicitor Johnathan Harker finds himself travelling through the Hungarian countryside and into Romania, on his way to a castle in the heart of Transylvania. There, one Count Dracula awaits Harker and proves to be an odd, yet amenable, host. Seeking to finalise a land deal in England, Harker and Dracula talk long into the night, though the former feels that there is something odd about his host. It is only when numerous unsettling things occur that Harker realises that Count Dracula is nothing like any man he has met before and eventually escapes the confines of the castle. 

Back in England, Harker‚Äôs fianc√©e, Mina, and her close friend, Lucy, are going through their own ordeals. Lucy Westenra suffers through significant bouts of sleepwalking. The two women travel to the seaside to clear their heads, but Lucy encounters someone the reader knows to be Dracula during one of her nocturnal jaunts and is eventually discovered with two minuscule puncture holes on her neck. Unsure of what to do, Westenra is sent to see Dr. Johnathan Seward, one of her suitors and director of the local mental hospital. When Dr. Seward cannot deduce all of these symptoms, he calls upon the renowned Dr. Abraham Van Helsing in Amsterdam to consult. 

The Dutchman arrives and begins some of his early queries. He is highly interested, though cannot be completely sure that he has a diagnosis of yet. Slowly, Lucy begins to fade from this mysterious neck injury and eventually died of her injuries, though her body transforms into a vampire of sorts, paralleling some of the actions Count Dracula is known to have been committing. 

Van Helsing works with Seward to locate the body and it is at this time that the Dutch doctor deduces that there is something eerie at work. Studying the situation before him, Van Helsing proposes the seemingly barbaric act of driving a stake through Lucy‚Äôs heart and then decapitating her, which is the only way to ensure that her spirit will be freed, according to some of his research and ancient lore. 

Done with that issue, but still needing to resolve the larger concern at hand, Van Helsing gathers a group to hunt down the Count, who seems to have taken up residence in England, and drive him back to Transylvania. Lurking in the dark and gloomy areas of Eastern Europe, Van Helsing prepares for the fight of his life, armed with only the most basic medicaments, in hopes of slaying this monster once and for all. 

Stoker lays the groundwork for a truly bone-chilling tale that has stood the test of time. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has the wherewithal to delve deep into the heart of a sensational 19th century story of horror and mayhem.

I am still kicking myself that I waited so long to read this sensational piece of fiction. Surely one of the early stories that has fostered such a strong tie between Dracula and Hallowe‚Äôen, Bram Stoker‚Äôs work provides the reader not only with thorough entertainment, but leaves a shiver up their spine every time they enter a dark room. 

With a cast of powerful characters, Stoker weaves his tale in such a way that the story never loses its momentum. Harker, Seward, and Van Helsing are all well-crafted and provides powerful contrasts throughout the narrative, while Count Dracula is not only eerie in his presentation, but also one of the scariest villains in 19th century literature. 

There need not be outward descriptions of gore and slaying to get to the root of the suspense in this novel, which seems to differ from much of the writing in the genre today, where gushing blood and guts pepper the pages of every book imaginable. The narrative is also ever-evolving, helped significantly by the journal-based writing that Stoker has undertaken. The reader is transported through the story using these varied perspectives (and some press clippings), rather than a straight delivery of the story from a single point of view. This surely enhances the larger package and does much to provide the reader with even more fright, at certain times. 

There are surely many stories taking place here, some of which deal directly with the issue at hand (read: Dracula), while others seem to solve themselves throughout the numerous journal entries. Whatever the approach, Stoker captivates the reader such that there is a strong desire to know how it all ends and if Van Helsing lives up to his more colloquial moniker of ‚ÄòVampire Hunter‚Äô. 

I wish to add for those who wish to take the audiobook approach, as I have done, the Audible version, with a full cast (including Alan Cumming, Tim Curry, and John Lee), adds yet another dimension to this story and should not be discounted. 

Kudos, Mr. Stoker, for such a riveting piece. I can only hope to find the time to read some of your other work, as well as that of your descendants, who seem to want to carry the torch and provide more Dracula for the modern reader.

506,jessica,Jane Eyre,"Apr 27, 2020",5,"mr. rochester walked so every other tall, dark, handsome, and broody male character could run. and thats the that on that.

i really dont have much else to add that hasnt already been said about this book, considering its been around for 150+ years. but i will admit how impressed i am with how modern this story feels. i think thats a key factor in why i enjoyed this so much - because it doesnt feel like a classic to me. 

not only is the writing very accessible and incredibly easy to read, which i dont find to the case for most books written during this time period, but the dialogue between characters is very forward thinking. the conversations between jane and mr rochester are very much similar to conversations that are happening today. i really admire how bronte incorporates feminist ideals into this story. and i honestly didnt expect the low-key thriller vibes present in some parts, so that was fun. 

overall, this is a great story. 10/10 would recommend.

507,Liz Lynch,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Sep 09, 2007",3,"Like eating fancy dessert at a gourmet restaurant, Memoirs of a Geisha is beautiful, melts lightly off the tongue and will be forgotten shortly after it's done. The language is strikingly lovely, and Golden paints a remarkable picture of a time and place. 

If you're looking to learn something deep about the psychology of Japanese culture, or meet nuanced characters, then I'd steer you elsewhere. The story only skims the top of the more complicated aspects of a Japan in decline, focusing mostly on a genteel lifestyle that probably seems more appealing from the outside. There's a way in which the book, written by a man and a westerner, is slightly fetishistic, but less so than you might imagine.

Another reader suggested that perhaps the superficiality of the story is intentional, and that the book, in a way, resembles a geisha. Beautiful and eager to please, yet too distant to really learn much from and ultimately little more than a beautiful, well-crafted object to be appreciated. If that's the case, Arthur Golden is remarkably clever, and I applaud him. If it's not the case, the book remains very pretty and an easy read."
508,Khurram,Divergent ,"May 08, 2017",5,"I enjoyed this book so much more than the Hunger Games. It probably not fair to compare the two, but they are on a similar subject. There is a good flow to this story, and it makes this book an easy read. The descriptions are great. The only small critique on that line is I did notice a couple of grammar and spelling mistakes, and if I noticed them, there were probably more than a few. However, I did really enjoy this book. For the first few chapters, I kept thinking that was quick. I would just read one more, and then by the time I got to the later chapters, I did not want to put the book down.

We join Beatrice on her journey of the most important year of her life. In this world, society is broken up into 5 factions:

Amity (The Peaceful)
Dauntless (The Brave)
Abnegation (The Selfless)
Erudite (The Intelligent)
Candour (The Honest)

At the age of 16, the people of each faction are tested for their aptitude and must choose a faction that potentially best fits them. Once you join a faction, that is it. Told in the quote ""faction before family."" Beatrice knows she does not fit into her own faction (Abnegation) as selfless acts simply do not occur to her on instinct. On the test day, she is given the results of Divergent and then told never to speak of it again. What does it mean? Why is it so dangerous? However, the next day, she must choose a faction, and should she stay with what she knows as there is no guarantee she will fit in any better in her a new faction.

The whole book is written from her perspective, so we tend to get information and interpretations from her, which is ok. The book is well thought out and with great characters and character development. The only thing I could find wrong with the book was the fights. The book is quite action-packed and exciting, but there are few hand to hand fights, so making slight mistakes in them is not such a problem. The problem with writing fights is that it is not just which strike is thrown, but you have to think very carefully about the positioning of each character when they throw and after they are hit counter. This was a minor detail in the book. The action in the book is more frequent short but brutal."

511,Reading_ Tamishly,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Dec 17, 2019",5,"First of all, let's forget it's a 'classic' that we all 'must' read for the sake of reading a classic.

Second of all, let's have no inhuman high expectations from this book.

Third of all, it's enough to know that this has been written from the perspective of a six year old girl.

And that's how we should pick up this one and go for it like we are picking up a newly released book and seriously that's the way it should be for everyone I would like to say...like again!

I won't go into details regarding what the book is about.

*Why the 5 üåü though:
The language is pretty simple and will stick with all kinds of reader till the end.
The flow is neat, clear and fast paced as a few characters are pretty mysterious and then there's some mystery element to the plot.
The characters are amazingly well-developed. Each and every character introduced has a clear role and has been given importance.
Subtle hints and sudden plot twists keep the pace rolling!
The character dynamics are the main highlights of this book. 
Themes tackled are hugely impactful. It talks about race discrimination, child upbringing, justice, family and in general how one human should see another human as.
I cannot point out all the things I loved about this book at the moment but yes, this book is much, much more than the things I have mentioned above.
The warmth in the story narration is something I did not expect at all. I am genuinely surprised still. 

Atticus will remain as one of my most loved, unforgettable characters. His character is so wholesome and someone to look up to.

The different emotions in between the lines are deep and I just couldn't ignore them. The humour is just incomparable. And yes, I gasped a lot in between regarding the unexpected turns in the story sequence. 

The bond between the siblings, the kids and their father, the friendship and the neighborhood, kinship relationship have been so well depicted. And yes, the court room scenes are just dealt with amazingly. I would say almost perfectly but yes, even though the lines have been perfect and great, I somehow felt that a real courtroom would never have perfect dialogues like that. And not everyone would just nod their heads even though everything spoken was right.

Some scenes broke my heart. Some scenes made me really helpless. Some scenes made me want to save some of the characters so bad that I had to hold the book for minutes before continuing on. 


The ending was perfect. There's closure. There's victory.


My reader soul has found another of its missing pieces!"
512,"Petra on hiatus, really unwell",Animal Farm,"Jun 13, 2008",5,"Amazon's very Orwellian involvement with this book at the end. If Amazon ever partnered Facebook they'd own us.

This is not really a review, but one of those moments where everything that was clear to you suddenly becomes utterly muddied and you really can't say what lies beneath the murky waters although a moment before you were sure you could.

I'm reading Christopher Hitchen's astonishingly percipient and brilliant Arguably: Essays. I read Animal Farm too young to identify the individual animals with actual characters on the stage of communism (the old boar Major is Marx, Farmer Jones is the Tsar, the pigs Napoleon and Snowball, Stalin and Trotsky respectively) so this essay is giving me a lot to think about. So far, nothing more so than this quote (below). 

(Background to the quote): A group of Ukrainian and Polish refugees in a displaced persons' camp had discovered sympathetic parallels with their own plight in Orwell's parable and had begged him for permission to translate his almost-totally unknown book. But...

The emotions of the American military authorities in Europe were not so easily touched. They rounded up all the copies of Animal Farm they could find and turned them over to the Red Army to be burned. The alliance between the farmers and the pigs so hauntingly described in the final pages of the novel were still in force. 

The book is banned in Cuba, North Korea, Burma, Iran, Kenya and most Arab countries. It is banned in the UAE not because of it's content but because it has anthropomorphic talking pigs which are unIslamic (is this not Orwellian in itself?). It is still censored in Vietnam. These nations wouldn't want ordinary people reading the book and looking at their own ruling porcine elites and seeing any parallels now would they? Who knows what kind of thoughts and actions that might lead to?

Amazon and Animal Farm
On 17 July 2009, Amazon.com withdrew certain Amazon Kindle titles, including Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, from sale, refunded buyers, and remotely deleted items from purchasers' devices after discovering that the publisher lacked rights to publish the titles in question. Notes and annotations for the books made by users on their devices were also deleted. After the move prompted outcry and comparisons to Nineteen Eighty-Four itself, Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener stated that the company is ""changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers' devices in these circumstances."" However, Amazon does not seem to a guarantee in its ToS that they won't don't this again and I understand that authors have the ability to edit (read 'change') parts of their books. This is because you can't buy a Kindle book, only rent one and Amazon can update (read 'change') them. Wikipedia and other sources

Next step: Fahrenheit 451. Get the firemen out to burn the books, only ebooks allowed where content can be controlled.

513,Shan B,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Mar 01, 2008",1,"Let me start this by saying I was very excited to read this book. I thought it was going to be good. It is not in any way good. It could have been good, the idea could have soared but in Niffenegger's hands it was destroyed by laundry lists of grocery bag contents, street directions, and punk bands until I even said, out loud, more than once, ""okay, I get it."" He bought groceries, he knows how to get around in Chicago, Clare likes to clean her studio, he is not just a punk rock poser but the real deal, complete with his cherry red Docs,etc. Seriously, this stuff does not pass for good writing in any circles. The tedious minutae of life is boring and makes the author look like she is trying to pad her story for more bulk.

The worst part of this book was that the whole thing was based on contrived plot devices. The whole time I was reading I was wondering why the author chose to have him time travel naked. To me it seemed like if it weren't for his constant pursuit of clothes there may be some real chance at something actually happening in the story. Then at the end of the book I realized that the whole naked thing was a tool to achieve the amputations at the end. 

Where was this woman's editor? How do things like this get published, this story was nowhere near polished and pared down enough to make it to publication. 

Also, the gory miscarriage scenes, yuck! 

There was no introspect into the character's hearts and minds. How does Henry feel about knowing when he is going to die? How does Clare deal with him being a time travel? We will never know because the book was too full of what they did and how they did it and nothing about how they felt. I don't care about that stuff. 

These characters were selfish, pretentious and self absorbed. And the credibility goes right out the window when they win the lottery. Come on!

I honestly don't see why this book is so well loved! This book angered me."

the world is a tough and inconsistent sphere.

because Daughter of Smoke and Bone is a much much better written book. it's no contest. she is lush and lyrical and there is a gravity to her writing that makes you stop every so often to murmur, ""well said, laini taylor, well said...""

this book is just fun.

this is unexpected pillowfight, marshmallow syrup on strawberry ice cream, kitten in a bag fun.

it was recommended to me on here by a different karen, and i borrowed it from work almost immediately. before that,i had never even heard of it, which is strange, because it appears to be something of a sensation. and i definitely get why.

if you are someone who needs your dystopian fiction to, you know, make sense, you probably won't like this. no one is going to read this book and think, ""oh, man - that is exactly where our society is headed! i can see that becoming a reality in five years' time!!"" nope.

it is more like a board game: there are rules and you accept them and you play. ""but why are you a scottie dog and i am a thimble?? that makes no sense!!"" 

because that's how that game is played. stop asking so many questions and roll the dice.

516,SK,Divergent ,"Sep 15, 2022",4,"A fun re-read. They don't make books like this anymore. 
I had forgotten so many events in this book that it still felt refreshing to read this after so many years. 

The plot, characters, drama is so well thought out and amazingly written. The heartbreak towards the end is still something not easy to read, but that's what makes it more real and likable."
517,J.G. Keely,A Game of Thrones ,"May 26, 2007",1,"There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre. Ironically, they often write the most predictable books of all, as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini. Though I'm not sure why they protest so much--predictability is hardly a death sentence in genre fantasy.

The archetypal story of a hero, a villain, a profound love, and a world to be saved never seems to get old--it's a great story when it's told well. At the best, it's exciting, exotic, and builds to a fulfilling climax. At the worst, it's just a bloodless rehash. Unfortunately, the worst are more common by far.

Perhaps it was this abundance of cliche romances that drove Martin to aim for something different. Unfortunately, you can't just choose to be different, any more than you can choose to be creative. Sure, Moorcock's original concept for Elric was to be the anti-Conan, but at some point, he had to push his limits and move beyond difference for difference's sake--and he did.

In similar gesture, Martin rejects the allegorical romance of epic fantasy, which basically means tearing out the guts of the genre: the wonder, the ideals, the heroism, and with them, the moral purpose. Fine, so he took out the rollicking fun and the social message--what did he replace them with?

Like the post-Moore comics of the nineties, fantasy has already borne witness to a backlash against the upright, moral hero--and then a backlash against the grim antihero who succeeded him. Hell, if all Martin wanted was grim and gritty antiheroes in an amoral world, he didn't have to reject the staples of fantasy, he could have gone to its roots: Howard, Leiber, and Anderson.

Like many authors aiming for realism, he forgets 'truth is stranger than fiction'. The real world is full of unbelievable events, coincidences, and odd characters. When authors remove these elements in an attempt to make their world seem real, they make their fiction duller than reality; after all, unexpected details are the heart of verisimilitude. When Chekhov and Peake eschewed the easy thrill of romance, they replaced it with the odd and absurd--moments strange enough to feel true. In comparison, Martin's world is dull and gray. Instead of innovating new, radical elements, he merely removes familiar staples--and any style defined by lack is going to end up feeling thin.

Yet, despite trying inject the book with history and realism, he does not reject the melodramatic characterization of his fantasy forefathers, as evidenced by his brooding bastard antihero protagonist (with pet albino wolf). Apparently to him, 'grim realism' is 'Draco in Leather Pants'. This produces a conflicted tone: a soap opera cast lost in an existentialist film.

There's also lots of sex and misogyny, and 'wall-to-wall rape'--not that books should shy away from sex, or from any uncomfortable, unpleasant reality of life. The problem is when people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality start writing about it, which seems to plague every mainstream fantasy author. Their pen gets away from them, their own hangups start leaking into the scene, until it's not even about the characters anymore, it's just the author cybering about his favorite fetish--and if I cyber with a fat, bearded stranger, I expect to be paid for it.

I know a lot of fans probably get into it more than I do (like night elf hunters humping away in WOW), but reading Goodkind, Jordan, and Martin--it's like seeing a Playboy at your uncle's where all the pages are wrinkled. That's not to say there isn't serviceable pop fantasy sex out there--it's just written by women.

Though I didn't save any choice examples, I did come across this quote from a later book:

""... she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest . . .""

Imagine the process: Martin sits, hands hovering over the keys, trying to get inside his character's head:

""Okay, I'm a woman. How do I see and feel the world differently? My cultural role is defined by childbirth. I can be bought and sold in marriage by my own--Oh, hey! I've got tits! Man, look at those things go. *whooshing mammary sound effects* Okay, time to write.""

Where are the descriptions of variously-sized dongs swinging within the confines of absurdly-detailed clothing? There are a set of manboobs (which perhaps Martin has some personal experience with) but not until book five. Even then, it's not the dude being hyperaware of his own--they're just there to gross out a dwarf. Not really a balanced depiction.

If you're familiar with the show (and its parodies on South Park and SNL) this lack of dongs may surprise you. But as Martin himself explained, when asked why there's no gay sex in his books, despite having gay characters, 'they‚Äôre not the viewpoint characters'--as if somehow, the viewpoints he chooses to depict are beyond his control. Apparently, he plots as well as your average NaNoWriMo author: sorry none of my characters chose to be gay, nothing I can do about it.

And balance really is the problem here--if you only depict the dark, gritty stuff that you're into, that's not realism, it's just a fetish. If you depict the grimness of war by having every female character threatened with rape, but the same thing never happens to a male character, despite the fact that more men get raped in the military than women, then your 'gritty realism card' definitely gets revoked.

The books are notorious for the sudden, pointless deaths, which some suggest is another sign of realism--but, of course, nothing is pointless in fiction, because everything that shows up on the page is only there because the author put it there. Sure, in real life, people suddenly die before finishing their life's work (fantasy authors do it all the time), but there's a reason we don't tend to tell stories of people who die unexpectedly in the middle of things: they are boring and pointless. They build up for a while then eventually, lead nowhere.

Novelists often write in isolation, so it's easy to forget the rule to which playwrights adhere: your story is always a fiction. Any time you treat it as if it were real, you are working against yourself. The writing that feels the most natural is never effortless, it is carefully and painstakingly constructed to seem that way.

A staple of Creative Writing 101 is to 'listen to how people really talk', which is terrible advice. A transcript of any conversation will be so full of repetition, half-thoughts, and non-specific words ('stuff', 'thing') as to be incomprehensible--especially without the cues of tone and body language. Written communication has its own rules, so making dialogue feel like speech is a trick writers play. It's the same with sudden character deaths: treat them like a history, and your plot will become choppy and hard to follow.

Not that the deaths are truly unpredictable. Like in an action film, they are a plot convenience: kill off a villain, and you don't have to wrap up his arc. You don't have to defeat him psychologically--the finality of his death is the great equalizer. You skip the hard work of demonstrating that the hero was morally right, because he's the only option left.

Likewise, in Martin's book, death ties up loose threads--namely, plot threads. Often, this is the only ending we get to his plot arcs, which makes them rather predictable: any time a character is about to build up enough influence to make things better, or more stable, he will die. Any character who poses a threat to the continuing chaos which drives the action will first be built up, and then killed off.

I found this interview to be a particularly telling example of how Martin thinks of character deaths:

""I killed (view spoiler)[Ned (hide spoiler)] because everybody thinks he‚Äôs the hero ... sure, he‚Äôs going to get into trouble, but then he‚Äôll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing [someone] is going to rise up and avenge his [death] ... So immediately [killing (view spoiler)[Robb (hide spoiler)]] became the next thing I had to do.

He's not talking about the characters' motivations, or the ideas they represent, or their role in the story--he isn't laying out a well-structured plot, he's just killing them off for pure shock value.

Yet the only reason we think these characters are important in the first place is because Martin treats them as central heroes, spending time and energy building them. Then it all ends up being a red herring, a cheap twist, the equivalent of a horror movie jump scare. It's like mystery novels in the 70's, after all the good plots had been done, so authors added ghosts or secret twins in the last chapter--it's only surprising because the author has obliterated the story structure.

All plots are made up of arcs that grow and change, building tension and purpose. Normally, when an arc ends, the author must use all his skill to deal with themes and answer questions, providing a satisfying conclusion to a promising idea that his readers watched grow. Or just kill off a character central to the conflict and bury the plot arc with him. Then you don't have to worry about closure, you can just hook your readers by focusing on the mess caused by the previous arc falling apart. Make the reader believe that things might get better, get them to believe in a character, then wave your arms in distraction, point and yell 'look at that terrible thing, over there!', and hope they become so caught up in worrying about the new problem that they forget the old one was never resolved.

Chaining false endings together creates perpetual tension that never requires solution--like in most soap operas--plus, the author never has to do the hard work of finishing what they started. If an author is lucky, they die before reaching the Final Conclusion the readership is clamoring for, and never have to meet the collective expectation which long years of deferral have built up. It's easy to idolize Kurt Cobain, because you never had to see him bald and old and crazy like David Lee Roth.

Unlucky authors live to write the Final Book, breaking the spell of unending tension that kept their readers enthralled. Since the plot isn't resolving into a tight, intertwined conclusion (in fact, it's probably spiraling out of control, with ever more characters and scenes), the author must wrap things up conveniently and suddenly, leaving fans confused and upset. Having thrown out the grand romance of fantasy, Martin cannot even end on the dazzling trick of the vaguely-spiritual transgressive Death Event on which the great majority of fantasy books rely for a handy tacked-on climax (actually, he'll probably do it anyways, with dragons--the longer the series goes on, the more it starts to resemble the cliche monomyth that Martin was praised for eschewing in the first place).

The drawback is that even if a conclusion gets stuck on at the end, the story fundamentally leads nowhere--it winds back and forth without resolving psychological or tonal arcs. But then, doesn't that sound more like real life? Martin tore out the moralistic heart and magic of fantasy, and in doing so, rejected the notion of grandly realized conclusions. Perhaps we shouldn't compare him to works of romance, but to histories.

He asks us to believe in his intrigue, his grimness, and his amoral world of war, power, and death--not the false Europe of Arthur, Robin Hood, and Orlando, but the real Europe of plagues, political struggles, religious wars, witch hunts, and roving companies of soldiery forever ravaging the countryside. Unfortunately, he doesn't compare very well to them, either. His intrigue is not as interesting as Cicero's, Machiavelli's, Enguerrand de Coucy's--or even Sallust's, who was practically writing fiction, anyways. Some might suggest it unfair to compare a piece of fiction to a true history, but these are the same histories that lent Howard, Leiber, and Moorcock their touches of verisimilitude. Martin might have taken a lesson from them and drawn inspiration from further afield: even Tolkien had his Eddas. Despite being fictionalized and dramatized, Martin's take on The War of the Roses is far duller than the original.

More than anything, this book felt like a serial melodrama: the hardships of an ensemble cast who we are meant to watch over and sympathize with, being drawn in by emotional appeals (the hope that things will 'get better' in this dark place, 'tragic' deaths), even if these appeals conflict with the supposed realism, and in the end, there is no grander story to unify the whole. This 'grittiness' is just Martin replacing the standard fantasy theme of 'glory' with one of 'hardship', and despite flipping this switch, it's still just an emotional appeal. 'Heroes always win' is just as blandly predictable as 'heroes always lose'.

It's been suggested that I didn't read enough of Martin to judge him, but if the first four hundred pages aren't good, I don't expect the next thousand will be different. If you combine the three Del Rey collections of Conan The Barbarian stories, you get 1,263 pages (including introductions, end notes, and variant scripts). If you take Martin's first two books in this series, you get 1,504 pages. Already, less than a third of the way into the series, he's written more than Howard's entire Conan output, and all I can do is ask myself: why does he need that extra length?

A few authors use it to their advantage, but for most, it's just sprawling, undifferentiated bloat. Melodrama can be a great way to mint money, as evidenced by the endless 'variations on a theme' of soap operas, pro wrestling, and superhero comics. People get into it, but it's neither revolutionary nor realistic. You also hear the same things from the fans: that it's all carefully planned, all interconnected, all going somewhere. Apparently they didn't learn their lesson from the anticlimactic fizzling out of Twin Peaks, X-Files, Lost, and Battlestar. Then again, you wouldn't keep watching if you didn't think it was going somewhere.

Some say 'at least he isn't as bad as all the drivel that gets published in genre fantasy', but saying he's better than dreck is really not very high praise. Others have intimated that I must not like fantasy at all, pointing to my low-star reviews of Martin, Wolfe, Jordan, and Goodkind, but it is precisely because I am passionate about fantasy that I fall heavily on these authors.

A lover of fine wines winces the more at a corked bottle of vinegar, a ballet enthusiast's love of dance would not leave him breathless at a high school competition--and likewise, having learned to appreciate epics, histories, knightly ballads, fairy tales, and their modern offspring in fantasy, I find Martin woefully lacking. There's plenty of grim fantasy and intrigue out there, from its roots to the dozens of fantasy authors, both old and modern, whom I list in the link at the end of this review

There seems to be a sense that Martin's work is somehow revolutionary, that it represents a 'new direction' for fantasy, but all I see is a reversion. Sure, he's different than Jordan, Goodkind, and their ilk, who simply took the pseudo-medieval high-magic world from Tolkien and the blood-and-guts heroism from Howard. Martin, on the other hand, has more closely followed Tolkien's lead than any other modern high fantasy author--and I don't just mean in terms of racism.

Tolkien wanted to make his story real--not 'realistic', using the dramatic techniques of literature--but actually real, by trying to create all the detail of a pretend world behind the story. Over the span of the first twenty years, he released The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and other works, while in the twenty years after that, he became so obsessed with worldbuilding for its own sake that instead of writing stories, he filled his shed with a bunch of notes (which his son has been trying to make a complete book from ever since).

It's the same thing Martin's trying to do: cover a bland story with a litany of details that don't contribute meaningfully to his characters, plot, or tone. So, if Martin is good because he is different, then it stands to reason that he's not very good, because he's not that different. He may seem different if all someone has read is Tolkien and the authors who ape his style, but that's just one small corner of a very expansive genre. Anyone who thinks Tolkien is the 'father of fantasy' doesn't know enough about the genre to judge what 'originality' means.

So, if Martin neither an homage nor an original, I'm not sure what's left. In his attempt to set himself apart, he tore out the joyful heart of fantasy, but failed replace it with anything. There is no revolutionary voice here, and there is nothing in Martin's book that has not been done better by other authors.

However, there is one thing Martin has done that no other author has been able to do: kill the longrunning High Fantasy series. According to some friends of mine in publishing (and some on-the-nose remarks by Caleb Carr in an NPR interview on his own foray into fantasy), Martin's inability to deliver a book on time, combined with his strained relationship with his publisher means that literary agents are no longer accepting manuscripts for high fantasy series--even from recognized authors. Apparently, Martin is so bad at plot structure that he actually pre-emptively ruined books by other authors. Perhaps it is true what they say about silver linings . . .

Though I declined to finish this book, I'll leave you with a caution compiled from various respectable friends of mine who did continue on:

""If you need some kind of closure, avoid this series. No arcs will ever be completed, nothing will ever really change. The tagline is 'Winter is Coming'--it's not. As the series goes on, there will be more and more characters and diverging plotlines to keep track of, many of them apparently completely unrelated to each other, even as it increasingly becomes just another cliche, fascist 'chosen one' monomyth, like every other fantasy series out there. If you enjoy a grim, excessively long soap opera with lots of deaths and constant unresolved tension, pick up the series--otherwise, maybe check out the show.""

My Fantasy Book Suggestions"
518,Lora,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Jun 03, 2011",5,"I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*
I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.
I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.
It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting. 
And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love? 

In regards to the ending: (view spoiler)[I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn't suspect Quirrell a bit! If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape, I obviously missed them. (hide spoiler)]

FAVORITE QUOTE: ""But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

My reviews of other titles in this series:

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
519,Lisa,Lord of the Flies,"Jun 25, 2014",5,"""We did everything adults would do. What went wrong?""
 
You did everything adults would do. That's what went wrong.

There is much to be said against this novel, and it has been said, eloquently, poignantly, many times. Let me make a case for keeping it on the curriculum despite the dated language, the graphic violence, the author's personality...
 
There are two myths about adolescents, and this novel does away with them in a - admittedly - drastic way. First of all, there is no general innocence in adolescents. They do what grown-ups do, but in a less mature and experienced way. That means they cheat, lie and steal, and use violence to achieve their goals, and they are vain and interested in dominating and manipulating others. But they are also caring, loving and resourceful, and willing to serve the community in which they participate.

The second myth regards the helplessness and general dependence of adolescents, which is also only true as long as they have grown-ups around. Leave adolescents alone, and they will organise themselves. The best example of what happens to a group of teenagers left alone is shown if a teacher in a (civilised) school in a (civilised) country leaves for just a couple of minutes. 

If you have never experienced the amount of destructive power that is possible in that short time-span, you might think Golding exaggerates. Unfortunately, I can see any group of students turning into the characters in The Lord Of The Flies if they are put in the situation. I even know who would be the leaders, who would fight, who would bully, who would play along, and who would go under. Add teenage girls to the mixture and hell breaks loose.

Reading this novel with teenagers - if it is done with a big heart for their developmental stages and their hormonal glitches - gives them an opportunity to discuss a topic they already know everything about from their own lives but often keep hidden from naive, romantic grown-ups: the heart of an adolescent has dark corners, and it is important to shed light on the pain young people are able to cause each other if they are under the impression that they are not seen by the higher authority of the grown-up world.

Teenagers are grown-ups in training, and they make all the beginner mistakes without having the perspective to see the end of the tunnel. 

Reading offers perspective!"

Dark times & Rebelling.
& with such an integrity,

(this last part is about the whole HP plot of course *winks*)

Perfection!
Another Amazing story in the wizarding world of Harry Potter!

it's strange that our favourites change when we get older. This book became my favourite after my long distance with Harry Potter (2014?). & I totally love it right now! (though I loved it before too, but that Umbridge made me sooooooooo angryyyy! & 4 & 2 are still my top favourites. but this one also been added at the top of the list.)

Probably the Darkest time at Hogwarts. Harry had hard times (from the first to the last) in different sort of ways; angry, under pressure, self-struggling, mad, sad. I understood how he felt; I was angry with him, at the ministry's reaction & how they treated him after all he'd been through, it was not fair. But he stood up for what was right, the truth, not the sweet lies, or what was easy; even if he would be punished. He didn't back away from his words, just because those idiots didn't like it. (that's why I like the heroes; strong, brave, standing up for what is right)
I was sad with him. My heart was broken for him.

the World's getting darker . more pressure on Harry. The world we know is changing.

How marvelous everything have been designed, described. Magnificent, unique choices of words. & how beautifully (& emotionally) this book ended!
graceful!
I love the whole school year, like every other books, all those lessons, interesting subjects with fun, pressure & sarcasm.

‚ù§ Beside the concept of the story itself, I always love Hogwarts. I'm pretty sure we all do. beside walking in those spectacular corridors, eating in the Great Hall, exploring the castle & wandering on the grounds, all those interesting magical lessons.
Many secrets revealed through this book for us & for the characters.
just 'the hearing' parts was a bit dull, but re-reading in many years of being a potterhead, made me start to like it. (& by the whole fascinating & breathtaking plot, I could easily ignore that.)

why this book is my favorite too, in details:

ùì¢ùì™ùìªùì¨ùì™ùìºùì∂ retorts between Harry & Malfoy, always one of the best parts

These parts are always made me laugh hard.
[& in the Audiobook by Stephen Fry, especially at this part, I doubled over! that was Fantastic! his voice, changing for every character or situation, the drawling voice of Malfoys & ringings in his voice to perform dialogues, the pauses & ups & downs in narrating; which made the story even more awesome!]


üüá seeing many old lovable characters again! (which I was sure we would see them again, but I didn't know when & looking forward to them to come again & when it happened I was joyful, enthralled!)



üüá Best moments awards goes to *dramatic pause* D.A.!

Might doze off in studying (history) after a long night being awake.
He should know the answer, he had read it just this morning.

The exam questions reminded me of myself being student & having national exams at some of my educational years.
The bonus point. (I loved the bonus points in the exams XD)

2019: I also like Luna now.

521,Crumb,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jun 01, 2018",5,"I've been putting off writing this review for days because I knew that this would be a struggle for me. There aren't enough words in the English language that could accurately convey my feelings for The Time Traveler's Wife. If you haven't read this book, I urge you to do so. You can expect a literary experience unlike one you've ever had.

What did I love most about this book? The love story. It was truly enchanting. The two protagonists, Henry and Clare were not only meant for each other, but it was as if they were destined to be together. They will go on to face obstacle upon obstacle, but their love for one another never wanes. 

Simply put, this was a book that had that Extra Something. The ""X"" factor or the ""IT"" factor, if you will. C'est magnifique!"
522,Luffy (Oda's Version),Dracula,"Sep 02, 2018",5,"** spoiler alert **
           Dracula, the book, struck a chord with me. In it was a fight between good and evil. Modern vampires have great seduction powers. I never liked that. I also didn't like vampires in many Urban Fantasy books. The Hollows series spring to mind. The greatest change in the villainous vampires arises in Anne Rice's books. It was a perfect case study of an idea done to the death.

In Dracula, several people record their impressions. I 'pretend' to know that the women in the books, Lucy and Mina, have the same voice. Maybe the men are slightly different. They possess greater vocabulary, such as Lord Godalming's, and Jonathan Harker's recollections. Van Helsing, being a foreigner has his mistakes in grammar, and therefore has the most unique voice.

Throughout the book, we don't see the vampire Dracula triumph much. Except maybe when he turns Lucy into an undead. But even then, through the guiding hands and the knowledge of van Helsing, she is freed from her shackles. But Jonathan escapes from his imprisonment. And the vampire cannot settle in London. He was found out by our 'A-team' and had to flee for his life. He expresses baffled malignity.

It is the testament to Bram Stoker's neatness that I could follow most of the story. And I'm in awe of his mind, which chronicles the entire story via journal entries (or phonograph recordings in the case of John Steward), all of which are dated. I don't mean outdated, but dated, day after day. And I mourned the death of Quincy Morris, gallant to the end, dying with a smile on his lips.

The entire book defies what happens in movies and series (of which latter I've watched only True Blood). Most people don't read books regularly. So their idea of the vampire comes from horror movies. And Boris Karloff and especially Bela Lugosi as vampires are etched in the minds of most people. I don't think cinephiles will get any influence from the 1992 movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. That was a mess. The book still stands proud. As it should. Thus ends my review on 02 Sep 2018."
523,emma,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Nov 09, 2020",3,"I bought this book on November 8, 2016, and then I somehow picked it up by sheer coincidence precisely on November 8, 2020.

In spite of this divine coincidence, I did not like the read much.

If I had read it when I actually bought it, I probably would have, but I think I've evolved past this kind of unilateral-view things-are-sad white-woman-book-club energy. Societally, we all have. In the early 2000s, maybe we only had room for 1 feeling about Afghanistan (or okay, 1 in addition to War), but now we can have complex views of places. And I wish this were a more complex narrative than Suffering.

Also, the treatment of hijabs and burqas in this book explains why white women thought their sole quest on this earth was to """"""free"""""" Muslim women from """"""having"""""" to wear them.

This was not a terrible book at all, but it just is no longer my cup of tea.

I can count clearing it off of my incredibly aged owned TBR as a win, though.

Bottom line: Good! Just not for me.

524,Anne,The Great Gatsby,"Jul 09, 2020",3,"So this was a weird little story about people with too much money.
The main characters just kind of flopped around drinking cocktails, smoking, and complaining about the heat. When they weren't cheating on their spouses, that is.

 

The gist is that this guy Nick, who is the only person with normal human emotions in the entire book, is recounting his special summer with The Great Gatsby.



Gatsby is this ultra-mysterious man with gobs of money who likes to throw lavish wingdings. Everyone who is anyone shows up to drink his booze, eat his food, and party till they puke.
BUT! He has a secret and he needs Nick's help.
He's in love. <--with Nick's cousin, Daisy
Daisy, however, is married to a douchebag named Tom, who is cheating on her with a floozy named Myrtle, who is married to a wimp named George, who wants to buy one of Tom's cars.
It's the great circle of life.


 
Gatsby was...? I don't know. 
Part of me felt sorry for him because he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made a shitload of money just to win over the woman he loved. Sure he did it illegally, but how the fuck else are you supposed to make a shitload of money? Not by believing that anyone can be anything in America, that's for damn sure.
The other part of me thought he was an idiot who just wanted what he couldn't have. If Daisy threw him over for a guy with money, then that right there should tell you something.
Move on, dumbass.

 

Daisy was...? Kind of a dick, obviously. Of course she 100% deserved Tom. How Gatsby didn't see it coming is something that boggles the mind. <--we've all known a Gatsby, though, right? Unwilling to face the fact that his crush is a bitch on roids.



Myrtle was...?
Well, that shit was just funny. She didn't deserve to be road pancake, but if it had to happen to someone, at least it wasn't her dog.



Jordan was...? A golfer, a bit of a klepto, and Nick's quasi-love interest. You never get the feeling they're really dating-dating. <--more like they're both killing time? She was somewhat of a non-character for me. 



Tom was...? An entitled, smarmy buffoon. But apparently, that's a good look on some people, because everything seems to come up roses for him.



At the end of the day, I'm not really sure why this is considered a must-read.
It's basically just a slice of asshole life. The very wealthy, very bored, and very cliqueish don't necessarily interest me and this story really wasn't an exception. I think it has the same appeal as those reality shows that follow rich housewives, or television series about wealthy a-holes doing shit like murdering their business rivals on yachts. Like, somehow I'm supposed to think, ""Oh, look! Their lives aren't perfect, either!"" but all I really end up thinking is, ""You miserable fuckers can't think of anything better to do on a yacht?"", because I sure as hell could come up with something a bit more fun than that.



The best thing about The Great Gatsby was the length. I loved that it didn't drag on and on and on. There weren't a lot of words wasted on unnecessary side plots that didn't go anywhere or descriptions of scenery that didn't matter. I appreciated that quite a bit.

 

Oh, the version I listened to had a bunch of letters written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Some of them were interesting, but oh my god, the guy sounded like such a snobby cunt when he was talking about how worthless and low-brow other authors of his day were. This didn't really matter to the story, but it was sort of a pathetic note to end the book on. And maybe the intent of putting those letters out there wasn't to make him look bad? Maybe I'm supposed to think he's right and that he and his pal Hemmingway were a step above everyone else? True literary champions!
If I'm honest about it, I'm exactly the sort of peasant reader that enjoys the more unpretentious novels, so to hear one author bashing another one for being too easily digested by the sweaty masses doesn't give me the warm fuzzies.



Then again, these were the guy's private thoughts, so it's not really any of my business. Plus, I can be a real twat when I'm venting to someone close to me, so who am I to judge?

 

This one won't go down as a favorite but it is another beloved classic that I can check off of my list. 



As far as the audiobook goes? I think Tim Robbins is a good reader, but this is my 2nd book read by him and he's not my favorite. He has this tendency to lower his voice and whisper sometimes. Thing is, my hearing is SHIT, so I end up either having to go back and relisten or just kind of miss a few words. I'm not blaming Robbins, just my eardrums. I'll probably try to avoid books by him in the future, but not because he sucks.

525,Chelsea,Wuthering Heights,"Jun 29, 2007",1,"I've tried it three times. I know people are obsessed with it. I hate everyone in the book - and I just can't care about a book where I actually hate the characters.

And, sure, I get the interpretation that as terrible as Heathcliff and Cathy are, it's their love that redeems them, and isn't that romantic.

No."
526,Shannon,A Game of Thrones ,"Sep 27, 2007",1,"I really feel the necessity of a bit of personal backstory here, before I start the review. Back in 1996 when this book first came out, and I was about 14 or 16 years old, I saw the hardcover on a sale table for about $5 and couldn't resist a bargain (still can't, though I'm more cautious these days). So I started reading this book with the vague idea that it was a flop, and that may not have helped, but I got through 100 pages of it before feeling so crapped off with it that I shoved it in my cupboard and tried not to think about it. Page 108 to be exact. More on why later.

If you've heard of this book, or read it, you're probably aware that far from being the flop I assumed it was at the time (and I didn't know anyone who was reading it), the series has gone on to be one of the big Cash Cows of the fantasy genre. Computer games, role-playing games - there's even a board game that looks like Risk. Sooner or later there'll be a movie or something, no doubt (I'm moderately surprised one isn't in the works already). People love this book and this series. So I'm well aware I'll probably be lynched for this review, because even the people on Goodreads who didn't like it still had great things to say about it.

But reviews are subjective, and here's mine.

In the vein of Tolkein, Jordan, Elliott, Goodkind, Hobb, Eddings, Feist et al, A Game of Thrones is set in the classicly boring-and-overdone medieval-England-esque setting, and is essentially about a bunch of nobles fighting over a throne. Great. Very original. Praised for its focus on political intrigue, its lack of magic and similar fantasy tropes, and its cast of believable and interesting characters, I found the book tedious. The first ""epic fantasy"" series I read (after Narnia) was Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, and it's true that I struggled with the first book, Eye of the World. But there were elements to it that I liked, characters who I felt attached to, enough to read the second book and become hooked, and so on. I love 1000-page long, fat fantasy books. I love huge casts of characters and have no problem keeping up with them. I've read Jennifer Fallon's Wolfblade trilogy and Second Sons Trilogy, both of which are heavy on political intrigue and very low on magic, and they're supurb. A Game of Thrones is not. It offers nothing new to the genre, and does nothing original with what it has.

Narrated in turns by Eddard (Ned) Stark, Lord of Winterfell; his wife Lady Catelyn; his bastard son Jon Snow; his very young daughters Sansa and Arya; his middle son Bran; Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf and brother to the Queen; and young Daenerys Targaryen, last of the line of dragon kings and exiled to the land beyond the narrow sea, the book is divided into neat chapters headed by the name of one or the other, so you know exactly whose point-of-view you're going to get and where you are in the plot. Thanks for holding my hand Martin, but I don't like this technique. The chapter headings, I'm referring to. It encourages me to start wondering about the character before I've even started reading. ""CATELYN"" the chapter title reads: is she young or old, a peasant, a farmer, a daughter, a mother, nice, mean... I start imagining things and then have to correct it all as the character is revealed during the chapter. There's power in names, and withholding them or putting elements of a character's personality first is often more compelling, and better writing. It also made it harder to get through the book, because at the end of one chapter I'd see the name of the next, think ""oh great, him/her again, their story's boring"" and put the book down.

Let me be perfectly straight: I did not find any of the characters to be particularly interesting; though Jaime Lannister had something about him, you hardly ever saw him. They all pretty much felt like the same character, just in different situations. The differences between them, for example the good-girl Sansa and her tomboy sister Arya, felt forced, superficial and clich√©d. Ned is all about honour and duty, but especially honour, with love a more minor consideration, but honestly, could the man be more stupid? Eddard's a moron, and dull, and his only saving grace is that he's nice to his daughters. Let's be clear about something else right here: this world and its people are so sexist and misogynist it's ludicrous. There are many derogatory references to women's tits, metaphors about screwing whores, descriptions of Daenerys getting her nipples pinched by her horrible brother Viserys - not to mention her marriage, at twelve, to a horselord whose men rape women like there's no tomorrow; incest and so on. The first time I tried to read this book, I was offended and disgusted (it didn't help that I'd read Pillars of the Earth not long before; though I did not grow up sexually repressed or prudish or anything like that, I have never found reading descriptions of rape to be all that easy, especially when they're treated so dismissively) - yet oddly my impressions of the characters were much more favourable. I read it now and I just felt contempt.

No one character stands out, though Arya has potential. Catelyn is as boring as her husband, and her sister Lysa is, let's face it, mad as a hatter and a sure sign of why women are unfit to rule (a clear message in this medieval-esque patriarchal world). Queen Cercei too. Tyrion, the dwarf, seems on the verge of having charisma but fails, and Daenerys... I want to like someone, but Martin doesn't give his characters any depth. Sure, they're all flawed and a flawed character is a great literary device - the anti-hero, etc. But Martin's characters are walking clich√©s, even the dwarf. 

The plot is also pretty weak. I don't need elves and magic and dragons - in fact, I tend to avoid them, especially elves *yawn* - but you've gotta give me something else. A bildungsroman does wonders - yes, let me see the characters on a journey of life rather than a quest, quests are tired. There's no quest in A Game of Thrones, and that's fine with me. But what is there? Jon goes to the Wall that separates the wilderness from the Seven Kingdoms (why is it called the Seven Kingdoms when there's only one kingdom?) and is attacked by an Other, a kind of zombie creature; Ned goes to the capital to take up the role of King's Hand because the King, Robert, likes to spend his time boozing, whoring and hunting; Catelyn follows to tell him someone tried to kill Bran; Ned tries to discover why the previous Hand died... And swords with names, seriously, what's with that? I'm so sick of such blatant phallic symbols and their representations, and the whole creed of honour and duty and gallant knights...

What frustrates me most is that this could have been a really interesting story, if only the author had better talent at writing characters - or letting them write themselves. The plot is not the problem, though it's largely uneventful, with no climactic moments because even those are written at the same pace as the rest, with no drammatic flourishes (come on, we all like those, let's be honest). But the characters, *sigh*, their motivations are simplistic, their actions extremely predictable, and while they don't blur one into another neither do any of them stand out. Also, the type of setting seems mostly convenient: with the focus on the nobles and their squabbling, you don't learn much about the lower classes, or what kind of food is grown here, or what kind of industry supports the economy, or anything about the cultures - using the clich√©d medieval England setting allows Martin to ignore one of the more fascinating aspects of society and leaves his world shallow, like surface water, without support (using this old and worn Fantasy setting allows an author to get lazy about world-building). The history of the land is also riddled with clich√©s, and sort of thrown in here and there as if to remind the reader ""it is a real place, look, here's what the First Men did!"" 

As for the writing, it's easy to read and calm, though very slow and rather lacking in tone or any interesting stylistic quirks: flat and bland, in other words. There's no atmosphere in this book. There're a few bad lines, like ""A storm of rose petals blew across a blood-streaked sky, as blue as the eyes of death"" (p.425) - his one concession to drama, it seems, though if you read it again you'll notice it doesn't actually make sense; and a few awkward sentences that leave you scrambling, such as ""Catelyn watched her son [Robb Stark] mount up. Olyvar Frey held his horse for him, Lord Walder's son, two years older than Robb, and ten years younger and more anxious."" (p.696) I noticed a similar sentence later, and I guess I know what he means but really, it's terrible writing.

On the plus side, there were a few things I liked. The direwolves - large ferocious animals as constant companions and protectors: always a winner with me; the intriguing climate, where summer and winter lasts years, decades even, before changing (how does that work? Seriously, what do they eat?); Daenerys' dragon eggs, and the Dothraki, the horse lords - though they were pretty superficial and confined to a rigid list of adjectives - I would have liked to understand their culture better. In many fantasy books my problem is the whole good vs. evil clich√©, which generally involves the plot. Here, my problem is that the characters are so black-and-white. They are described, good, that's settled, now what? There's no grey. No character development. They never once surprised me.

I honestly don't know if I'll read the next book. The Wheel of Time taught me (at the same age as I first tried reading this book, 16) that the first book in a series can be the weakest, because of the amount of extrapolation and background etc. that goes on. I didn't find that problem here, it was very grounded in the now, which makes me think the next book will be more of the same. I keep coming back to the reasons why I struggled to finish this book: boredom, clich√©d and empty characters, not enough balance (as in, there's no love in this book, and if the characters are so realistic why don't they love?), and predictable events. You know what it reminds me of? Marion Zimmer Bradley's equally famous The Mists of Avalon - another book I couldn't finish. If you like Arthurian fantasy, and that kind of style, then this would be a good book for you: the excessively patriarchal culture, the battles, the hint of magic and something glorious lurking around the edges but never coming to the fore, it's all here, neatly packaged. Obviously it works for a lot of people. 

But to all those people who say that Martin has opened up the genre in new ways, that he is the best writer of the epic fantasy crowd and so on, I have to wonder, have they read anything else? And then I wonder whether it's a matter of which author you read first and grow attached to, and so compare all the others. I don't think I fell into that trap as such, because Jordan's lost the plot, literally, Goodkind's personal politics and propaganda have taken over his story, and the one epic fantasy series that I love above all others - to date - is Kate Elliott's Crown of Stars series, which I didn't start reading till I was in uni. But I really wonder, how this story grabbed other people. If it grabbed you, I'd love to hear how and why, because sometimes I feel like I'm too jaded or something, too snobby maybe ...."

528,Matt,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Jan 14, 2008",5,"i think 'ender's game' is the only book i've read three times. for me books often don't have repeat reading value in the same way some movies have repeat viewing value. it's probably because a movie takes two hours of your time while a novel, for me, takes a week or longer. so for someone like to me read a novel twice, not to mention three times, is really saying something [and yes, i realize the inherent snobbery in that statement].

i've thought long and hard about what makes 'ender's game' so appealing. it's got a sympathetic protagonist, lots of great action, lots of heart, and a plausible twist of an ending. on those merits only 'ender's game' works. it's a lot of fun to read and orson scott card manages to inject some really moral and ethical quandries without resorting to didactism or heavy-handedness. for example, the manipulations of the battle school powers-that-be are presented and inspected, but card never explicitly paints them as the enemy. they are who they are, for better or for worse, but it's up to the reader to for his or her own opinions. same for ender and his merry band of castoffs. card understands that good v. bad is never as simple as black v. white. the world and universe are, more often than not, varying shades of gray. and the folks who inhabit that gray universe, for better or for worse, are who they are. they all have a part, they all have a purpose--even if those parts and purposes contradict each other.

'ender's game' is also a great story of the value and importance of friendship. i choke up everytime ender's friends great him over the headset and the kids prepare for the final 'battle.' who wouldn't want friends like bean, petra, hot soup and the rest? i sure would.

but i think the real appeal for 'ender's game' comes from the belief that we all want to believe that there's something uniquely special about us. i think it's safe to assume that most of us have, at one point or another, felt like the underdog, the castoff, the misfit, the misunderstood, or the underappreciated, and that if people would just give us a chance, we'd shine. in that way ender is very much a universal character. he embodies a small part of each ous. yes, he is treated unfairly and manipulated, but he's also the smartest kid in the room. there's something very appealing about that. at least there is for me. whether or not i'm the smartest person in the room is irrelevant, but i want to believe it. and whenever i read 'ender's game' there's a small hope that it just might be true."
529,Samra Yusuf,Of Mice and Men,"Oct 13, 2018",4,"So it starts as you lay there awake, in the quiet hours of night, lulling your head to be hushed of those deafening thoughts, faces, voices, you kept on getting day long, as you con your head into forged drowsiness, and it starts dawning on you, the coiled snake sitting in the corner of your mind tilts its head, clogs every nerve in his coil, deep-seated thought of being all alone in this universe of biological process over process strikes you to the core, universal loneliness houses your whole being, Our uniqueness makes us special, makes perception valuable - but it can also make us lonely. This loneliness is different from being 'alone': You can be lonely even surrounded by people. The feeling I'm talking about stems from the sense that we can never fully share the truth of who we are, we can never talk the next soul of our inner happenings, the loneliness of this kind eats our being and we device heavens, If not in this life, but in the life to come, we don‚Äôt want to be this alone, but there are some stories who teach us the inevitability of it, no matter how far we travel in pursue of a dream land, we will always be alone!
 ‚ÄúJust like heaven. Ever‚Äôbody wants a little piece of lan‚Äô. I read plenty of books out here. Nobody never gets to heaven, and nobody gets no land. It‚Äôs just in their head. They‚Äôre all the time talkin‚Äô about it, but it‚Äôs jus‚Äô in their head.‚Äù
What if just in our head it all is, what if we are always been delusional by definition, of people we thought we loved or were loved, of sickness we thought were cured, of people we thought we‚Äôd known, of souls we thought had touched, of love we thought had lived, of memories we thought had faded, of faces we thought had gone, or weren‚Äôt there at the first place. This is the story of unloved and alone, of George Milton and Lennie Small, the story of two antithetic coming together in bond only death dared disrupt. The story of the dream which dwelt all just in head and inspired them to work from place to place in the wake of depression years in America.
Steinbeck‚Äôs characters are suspiciously caricaturesque,as if placed there just for that purpose, with no backdrop stories of their own, no life before the opening scene, a giant-structured low at wits character to be paired with equally short-statured but quick-wit George who protects Lennie from the harms of his world, they dreamt of rabbits and a farm where there won‚Äôt be having any masters, a land of their own, in the times of impossibilities and hunger extreme, universality of their dream takes the reader in awe of ingeniousness of the writer, nihilistic viewpoint of life being a journey from zero to zero is too much loud in undertones of his prose, the dream of a land of their own was a driving force to keep their heads up the consuming loneliness which seems to be ever prevalent in the air that all characters breathe in.
‚ÄúThere is a terrible emptiness in me, an indifference that hurts‚Äù said Camus in his last manuscript, this emptiness echoed through this sad tale of shocking ending, the ending we were given the hints of from the very start, the ending we kept denying to accept till the very end..."
530,jessica,The Alchemist,"Jun 12, 2012",3,"tl;dr - important message, disappointing execution.

for this to have been described as a story that changes lives, im a little let down. whilst this certainly had the potential to be ‚Äòlife changing,‚Äô i felt there were many aspects which kept the story from delivering what could have been a meaningful experience. 

firstly, this is told like a parable. i would consider this story to fall more along the lines of religious allegory than philosophical text. that, in itself, is neither here nor there. however, i read somewhere that effective parables should comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. unfortunately, this book does neither of those things - it pampers to the egos of the self-righteous and chastises those who dont adhere to certain values. which is a shame, because this was supposed to be a story about following ones heart by chasing dreams and passions. too bad that message got lost somewhere along the way. 

secondly, i didnt connect with the any of characters, as i found them to be very two-dimensional. for a story that was meant to be about personal growth, i did not get any sense of emotion in the writing. a boy sells his entire livelihood, sets sail for distant continent, and crosses an entire desert in search of something he desperately desires - and yet, i couldnt care less about his journey. also, the portrayal of women in this is frustratingly poor. 

anyways, i liked the idea. i personally try to live my life by many of the lessons and teachings in this book - i believe it is important for one to follow their dreams, to always listen to their heart, and to never give up on something they are passionate about (as much as realistically possible). but i think the effectiveness of those messages was lost in this story. 

‚Ü† 2.5 stars"
531,Rishi,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Aug 05, 2007",1,"** spoiler alert **
           A friend of mine once commented that To Kill a Mockingbird was the most racist book he'd ever read.

I agree with him. Now, I know this book is drawn from the author's true experiences, but she choose to write a novel and thus I will judge it as a novel. With it's irrevocable integration into the American (and Canadian) public school curricula, I think this novel has probably done more to perpetuate racial stereotypes than any other single force. 

If I had to sum up To Kill a Mockingbird in one sentence, this would be it: the poor helpless black man is lost until a saintly white man comes to his side to crusade for his cause. Unfortunately, the damn darkie is so stupid that he goes and gets himself killed just when the white man figured he had another shot at clearing him. Oh well, the white man tried his best, and for a negro too! What a hero.

What the hell is that?"
532,Matthew,Charlotte's Web,"Mar 05, 2014",5,"Another classic read with the kids! I love reading to them ‚Äì they enjoy a chapter every evening and it gives us some good, quality family time. Also, it is cool to see them disappointed if we don‚Äôt have time to read (sad, but cool that it is so important to them!)

If you don‚Äôt remember Charlotte‚Äôs Web from your childhood, did you even have a childhood?

While it is dated ‚Äì even more so now than when I read it as a kid ‚Äì it is a timeless tale of life, death, and friendship. There are so many amazingly deep facets in this little book written for children. I am pretty sure a group of adults could still have a very deep discussion about the themes, plot points, and characters in this book.

I mentioned that death is a key part of this book. Some may think that could be too much for kids. But I feel like White presented it in the perfect way to show that death and rebirth are a part of life; perfect in a way as to not upset kids and allow them to explore their curiosity on the subject.

If you have never read Charlotte‚Äôs Web, you really should!"
533,Orsodimondo,The Da Vinci Code ,"Oct 10, 2020",3,"L‚ÄôUOMO DI VITRUVIO


Il film omonimo √® diretto da Ron Howard. √à stato un grande successo paragonabile a quello del libro, che ha venduto oltre 80 milioni di copie.

Parigi, il Louvre, un dipinto di Caravaggio, probabilmente La morte della Vergine, un vecchio ferito a morte, allarme che scatta, grate di ferro che scendono, l‚Äôassassino che rimane fuori e sembra non riuscire a completare l‚Äôopera, il vecchio si denuda e stende per terra per assumere la posizione del celebre Uomo vitruviano di Leonardo da Vinci, che tutti quelli che usano l‚Äôaeroporto di Fiumicino hanno imparato a riconoscere. Quando arrivano i soccorsi √® troppo tardi, il vecchio √® passato a peggiore vita. Ma ha lasciato un testamento prezioso scritto col sangue, alcuni numeri e il nome di Robert Langdon.
Un inizio al Fulmicotone.


Robert Langdon √® Tom Hanks, la giovane alle sue spalle √® Audrey Tautou.

I vangeli apocrifi, i rotoli del Mar Morto, Maria Maddalena incinta sotto la croce che spos√≤ Ges√π resuscitato, una setta con duemila anni alle spalle per custodire il mistero del Santo Graal, i Templari, l‚ÄôOpus Dei, Merovingi, Priorato di Sion, codici vari, simbologia (il protagonista, Robert Langdon, √® celebre proprio per la sua capacit√† di interpretare segni e simboli), e molto altro, con ritmo incalzante, mozzafiato, mescolato agitato e frullato.


Il film √® uscito tre anni dopo il romanzo, nel 2006. Il Louvre, come nel libro, √® un set importante.

Per quanto Dan Brown lo presenti come basato su fatti storici reali, documentati e comprovati, e per quanto si sia fatto a gara invece a demolirli e contraddirli, risultano coerenti e verosimili; per quanto io lo abbia a suo modo divorato steso in spiaggia ad evitare l‚Äôombra; e per quanto sia rimasto affascinato per il tempo della lettura ‚Äì e solo per quello, non un attimo dopo ‚Äì dal ritmo, dal montaggio alternato, da descrizioni , snodi drammaturgici e colpi di scena, al momento di chiuderlo e metterlo via mi sono accorto che stavo sorridendo e non avevo creduto in nulla di quanto avevo letto. 
Opera di pura immaginazione e fantasia.
Alla quale purtroppo manca anche un minimo pizzico di ironia, che avrebbe potuto renderla memorabile: al contrario, √® romanzo che si prende dannatamente sul serio.


Il cattivone √® un attore che mi piace molto, ma riesco a vedere troppo poco: Paul Bettany."
534,Anne,Dracula,"Jun 27, 2019",3,"Shockingly, not a whole hell of a lot of vampire stuff up in this bitch.
Mostly, it read like a dull travelogue with lots of emotions.
Bro love everywhere.
All the men loved all the women (platonically or otherwise) to the point they were willing to give their lives for whichever lucky lady was Dracula's snack at the time.
It was quite the love fest. 
Quite frankly, I'm not sure I'm buying that, Stoker.



And Dracula?
Not since Gary Olman's beehived old woman portrayal have I been less scared of this character.


Welcome to my home. Allow me to get you some Entenmann's coffee cake whilst you peruse my garage sale knick-knack collection and trip over my cats...

So, I've come to realize that very few of the classic characters or stories even remotely resemble what you think they will based on their modern counterparts. And in my uneducated opinion, most classics just aren't all that much fun to read. They're boring and filled up with tedious shit that I don't care about, and certainly don't want to read about. <-- Scenery, weather, random feelings about the scenery or weather, etc..
I guess back in the day it was high fun to take walks, look at the landscape, and then go back home and write about it in your diary. And while I'm sure that sounds like heaven to some people who yearn for simpler times, the idea of reading about the nonsense of someone else's daily life makes me want to scratch my eyes out.

 

Something I was surprised by, although in retrospect I shouldn't have been, was all the religious undertones in the story. Ok, yes. I knew Dracula was evil and couldn't be near crosses and whatnot, but I didn't think about this being a casually religious story about saving souls from damnation. 



Which, I mean, it's not like it was any fault of the vampires that they were dammed. At one time or another, they had all been humans who were targeted by another vampire as a snack. Vicious cycle and all that.
And poor Lucy seemingly ended up a chew toy simply because she was a sleepwalker.
Perhaps the moral of the story is that you need to make sure you aren't wandering around on moors at night so you don't get spotted by anemic monsters?

 

Speaking of Lucy, did anyone else notice how incredibly fucking lucky she was that every single guy in their group was a compatible blood type for her? All those blood transfusions! None of them even remotely hygienic or safe. 
Forget supernatural demons who turn into bats - those transfusions were the scariest shit in this entire book.



Brace yourself, because there are a lot of characters and POV switches. Again, most of what they were saying wasn't all that interesting, so it made me doubly happy that I decided to go with the audiobook version of Stoker's tale. 



And if I'm being 100% honest here, I probably zoned out a few times and daydreamed about when I needed to get the oil changed in my car or what we were having for dinner. But this is one of those books with a lot of superfluous information, so I don't think it hurt anything. I got the gist of it all okay without hanging on every word.

 

Fair warning, the first half of this book is unbelievably dull. 
Mina writes in her diary about how she fretts over Jonathan's lack of letters from Transylvania & how hard it is to keep Lucy from wandering out the door at night, Lucy gets mysteriously ill & her fiancee gets worried, and the doctor dude (John Seward) moons over Lucy & watches one of his psychotic patients eat bugs. 
Renfield, being the only character in the book who doesn't want to talk about friendship & loyalty every five minutes, was by far my favorite. 



The second half of the book was only slightly more engaging to me, but at least there was a bit of urgency to it at that point. Van Helsing was on to Dracula, so garlic was being thrown over everything, stakes were being handed out like candy, and anything pertinent was being kept from Mina so as not to upset her delicate sensibilities. 
And then when that backfired spectacularly, they cut her into the loop and she was able to do an old-timey version of what a competent woman looked like. They even compared her brain to that of a man! <--I love these old books. Really.



And what about Dracula?
Well, he was sort of this shadow figure that lurked around the edges of the book. You never really meet him. I know, right?! What about the whole Vlad the Impaler thing? How he fixated on Johathan & Mina for some reason? 
Buzzz! Nope.



Ok, get this: Dracula had been sort of like a special needs zombie who was finally learning stuff - like math...and how to employ minions to carry his dirt around for him. Apparently, up to this point, he had just been harassing his neighbors and nibbling on Romanian women. This whole thing with Lucy & Mina was supposed to be his bid at going global. 
Thank god for Van Helsing and his wacky foreign-man knowledge of urban legends.



I guess one of the oddest things that I realized about this horror story was that when Lucy & Mina started turning toward the dark side, they got sexy. 
Yeah. Like, that was how you could tell they were creatures of the dammed. The men got all freaked out and weepy because their sweet, mild-mannered ladies lost their wholesome looks. They became 
wanton hussies
 with throaty voices and pouty lips. 
Holy shit, right? If that doesn't say something about how wackadoo things used to be, I don't know what will. 
Innocence or else!



Anyway. This wasn't really a fun read but I'm glad I can finally say I've managed to put it behind me. Plus, it's one of those weird little windows into the past that reminds you things aren't as bad as they could be. I'd definitely recommend listening to the audio version with Tim Curry & Alan Cumming if you decide to go that route. The entire voice cast of this one really helped make it palatable for someone like myself who doesn't have the fortitude to read classics on their own."
535,Lisa of Troy,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Nov 08, 2022",5,"‚ÄúI loved you because you were marvelous, because you had genius and intellect, because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art.‚Äù
-	The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde

Wow! This book can really mess with your head.

Let‚Äôs start off by my confession. Most people won‚Äôt describe this book in these terms, but it‚Äôs my review, and this is my take‚Ä¶.

The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a young man named Dorian Gray. He is exquisitely good looking, and his friend, Basil Hallward, paints Dorian‚Äôs portrait. In walks, Lord Henry Wotton, Harry, who convinces Dorian that youth is everything, and Dorian wishes that his portrait would grow older while he could retain his youth.

Lord Henry is an extreme narcissist, and his conversations with Dorian are riveting. There are so many quotable quotes, and the discussion of his philosophy is highly intriguing. He essentially views anything honorable as horrible and boring. 

Although the book is The Picture of Dorian Gray, the book really belongs to Lord Henry. He is far from a perfect character, but he is definitely not boring.

540,Sean Barrs,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Dec 31, 2017",3,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is an absolute ground-breaking book; it is intelligent, creative and full of powerful anecdotal wisdom. It deservedly won the noble prize for literature. But how enjoyable is it? How readable is it?

Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, plays around with reality itself; he plays around with the limitations of fiction; he uses elements of magic, of the fantastic, to give voice to things that could never be said quite as effectively in normal terms: he breaks through realism and establishes his own original style. He did nothing short of launching a new mode of literary address: magical realism. He wasn‚Äôt the first writer to do such a thing, though his writing was the first to attract criticism which, in effect, allowed for it to be defined and recognised. 

For me, the strongest element of the book resides in its inherent pessimism, with its unfortunate understanding that history can (and will) repeat itself. All good intentions go awry, indeed, One Hundred Years of Solitude challenges the progress (or lack thereof) of society. It creates a self-contained history in its isolated framework, which, arguably, reflects the nature of mankind or, at least, it echoes Columbian history with its liberal history in the face of imperialism. No matter how much we want to change the world (or how much we believe in a revolution or a new political ideal) these good intentions often become warped when faced with the horrors of war and bloodshed. Nothing really changes. 

There‚Äôs no denying the success of M√°rquez‚Äôs epic; there‚Äôs no denying its ingenuity. I really enjoyed parts of the novel but it was awfully difficult to read, uncomfortably so. The prose is extremely loose and free flowing to the point where it feels like thought; it‚Äôs like a torrent of verbal diarrhoea that feels like it will never end. Characters die, eerily similar characters take their place within the story and the narrative continues until the well has completely run dry of any actual life. It is pushed so terribly far, one hundred years to be precise. 

And that‚Äôs my biggest problem. I‚Äôm a sentimentalist. I like to feel when I read. I like to be moved either to anger or excitement. I want to invest in the characters. I want to care about their lives and I want to be provoked by their actions. M√°rquez‚Äôs approach meant that this was impossible to do so. It‚Äôs a huge story, told in just a few hundred pages. It‚Äôs sweeps across the lives of the characters, some exceedingly important characters in the story are introduced and die a very short time after to establish the sheer futility of human existence and effort M√°rquez tried to demonstrate. 

M√°rquez writes against European tradition and the legacy of colonialism; he creates something totally new, which is becoming increasingly hard to do. Although I do appreciate this novel, I did not enjoy reading it as much as I could have done.

541,TL,Charlotte's Web,"Jan 06, 2015",4,No words I can say but this book is magical and beautiful and everyone should read it... a truly wonderful tale :) <3
542,Morgan,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jul 14, 2007",4,"Rating this was really hard, because I really liked it (really, really liked it) but I have such qualms with the ending, which could very possibly be a testament to Niffenegger's writing, I'm not sure. Anyway.

There were several things I wanted to talk about while I was reading it, more or less having to do with the notion of time-travel in the book. Obviously, there's always the immediate connection between Henry DeTamble and Billy Pilgrim, both of which are unstuck in time, Henry because of a bizarre disorder and Billy because of an existential break-down possibly hightened by Post Traumatic Shock Syndrome (I believe that's what it's ""technically"" called, but don't quote me) (this is also a literary theory I find to be too easy of an excuse). But also I found parallels between TTW and Octavia Butler's ""Kindred,"" the story of a black woman pulled back through time by one of her ancestors, a white slaveholder, to the period before the Civil War. The interesting thing I found about both of these are the link between Dana and Rufus (in ""Kindred"") that defies time and space, and an almost identical link between Henry and young Clare as an agenda to look at the concept of ""soul mates."" This then creates an ontological question concerning the nature of free-will and destiny, as Niffenegger herself states numerous times that Henry believes in free-will to a point, in that he's free to do whatever or so he believes, but because he is so immeshed in time what happens between him and Clare is more destiny: they are free to do what they will, but they'll always end up where they are meant to be type thing.

Another aspect that struck me was the idea of time being a biological construct, which was like ""holy shit rock on!"" Because time itself is little more than our perception of change and cause-and-effect, and the physical concept of space-time is nonlinear, that all time happens right now and it will always happen at any given moment, not so much circular as it is ever-present. But the notion that time itself can be a flux in our biological make-up was STUNNING. If I were a little more awake, maybe I could expound a little more about why that interested me so much.

(But to that effect, it did bother me a little that Niffenegger told her story more or less linearally, despite the constant jumping back and forth that Henry undergoes. I almost wish the whole thing was like that, with very little linear telling [which of course would be problematic with Clare's perception of events; hmmm . . .:]).

IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK AND YOU PLAN ON READING IT, PLEASE STOP READING THIS REVIEW HERE! I DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE ENDING FOR YOU!

This was one of the saddest books I've ever read, aside from ""Where the Red Fern Grows,"" but what I didn't like was that there was no real time to devote to being sad and crying over Henry's fate/destiny/end because the story kept going, no moment to allow the reader a bit of catharsis. And this probably wouldn't have been so bad if Henry hadn't lost his feet and could do nothing else but wait for his final moment. I felt that Henry was such a dynamic character and that he would have been one of those types of people who burn out instead of fade away, if he were a real person, but in the narrative he's not given that chance. When he flashes back to that morning at the Meadow I wanted him to be running when he's shot, not simply appearing, getting shot, and returning to the New Year's party. And the story kept going after! Which, granted, it is actually more of Clare's story (she is, of course, the time-traveler's wife and gets the first and final words of the story), and this does illuminate Henry's ever-present being in time and space. And then maybe he's not so much fading away as he is always existing. I don't know. I have mixed feelings about it."
543,James,Romeo and Juliet,"Jan 07, 2012",4,"Review


As I looked over my previously read books and searched for one that was missing a review, Romeo and Juliet stood out to me. But then I thought about it... who doesn't know about this play? Who hasn't read it in school sometime in the past? Who hasn't watched a movie version or seen some sort of take on the classic tortured romance story? And why on earth would anyone care to read another review, let alone my review, on it? Exactly. So... don't look for much here as I'm sure most everyone has read it already. And I'm not that funny to even make reading my opinions worth it. That said... a few shared thoughts about what I've learned from this play:



1. Parents exist to torture their children. It's a simple fact. If your child wants X, it is your responsibility to keep X away from him/her.



2. Love will always end in disaster. Don't attempt it without proper back-up.



3. Even though someone looks dead, they probably aren't. Kill them again just to be sure.



4. Your bros or girls don't always have your back.



5. Magic powders are the cure for everything. Always trust what you don't understand. And just inhale it like the world is about to end.



In all sincerity, I do like the play a lot. I've enjoyed countless interpretations. I think parts of it are brilliant and parts of it are pure illogical nonsense. Every TV show and movie has their own re-appropriation to tell. Not everything can be perfect when it comes to love. But this play certainly teaches a lot of lessons and provides a lot of bumps. And this reader still goes along for the ride...

Observa»õie: c√Ænd ajung pe insulƒÉ, mul»õi dintre copiii lui Golding par deja perverti»õi.

√én Via»õa, staniile & uimitoarele aventuri ale lui Robinson Crusoe, marinar din York (1719), gƒÉsim un personaj foarte norocos (iresponsabil de norocos!), cƒÉruia totul √Æi iese din plin.

√émpƒÉratul mu»ôtelor nareazƒÉ povestea pe dos.

Asta mi-a amintit de parabola despre Simorg, Regele pƒÉsƒÉrilor, rescrisƒÉ de Borges. 

La sf√Ær»ôitul lecturii (men»õionez cƒÉ pu»ôtanii s√Ænt recupera»õi de pe insulƒÉ), mƒÉ √Æntreb √ÆncƒÉ o datƒÉ: Omul este bun de la naturƒÉ »ôi numai societatea √Æl corupe?

545,Luffy (Oda's Version),Memoirs of a Geisha,"Aug 27, 2014",2,"What a disappointment. Why is it that in most books' reviews, only the marginal niche fans vote massively, upholstering the average score so unfairly. Unless, it is the romantics who do read diversely that in their unbiased way, gave the book four to five stars. Even people who gave the book the same score as me must have done so for different reasons. Maybe the ending threw them. Maybe I'll never know. I'm left scratching my head as to why this book is considered the best historical fiction on this site.

 I'll pool all my misgivings from the last third of the book in this paragraph. Chiyo's outlook towards life is delusional, and is vindicated by her being united with her beau. I wonder what friends I myself would have had my life been more successful. Chiyo's memories of her past are very selective. Sometimes she wants to be a geisha, but anyway she has no choice. Her heart breaks and reseals itself over her journey in becoming one. Her infatuation with the Chairman and her laughable dressing of her repulsion to Nobu sums up the genre of romance. The book is an ungodly mess in its themes. The analogies and lesson-like counsel that passed for wisdom at the end made it all clear. This book's just an escapist dream for delusional romantics of all genders and ages. My reason for my score is mainly that at not one point did the book reel me in. I was never hooked.

 I have to consider Hatsumomo, most of the book's main archenemy. She is described as stupid, but reveals herself as cunning. The latter attribute is proved beyond doubt. But her stupidity, abetted by drunkenness, only comes at the end. This was a missed opportunity to dress up a promising character. When Hatsumomo mars a kimono belonging to her rival, it's almost an act of vandalism. But we are never allowed to get the insight whether the act itself has the fuel of 30% meanness and 70% stupidity, or the other way round, or some other permutation.

 I first intended to write more than I'm doing. But I want to put this book behind me quickly. I want to make two points (which is more than my favorite team can make at the moment). First, I knew that such a dishonest and cowardly book would make of the tragic Pumpkin, a mean spirited person. I knew it! Her separation from Chiyo should have been temporary. Instead, she estranges herself from joy and purpose in life in the most random way. She is very wimpy in her decision to ""join the dark side"". It's just not that convincing. Maybe her scavenging act early on foreshadows what the author did with her. It's not an excuse though. Second thing, the stupid and bizarre episode between Chiyo and the Baron. It should have had consequences, but it seemed like the mother of all treaties had been signed between all parties. Very inexplicable. Inexplicable but quite welcome. It's an occurrence that made me distance myself from the narrator. I don't have to be concerned with her when she troubled trouble.

 This book, were it a flawed masterpiece and dealt with a genre I detest, would still have gotten more than two stars. But at no point did Memoirs reach a pinnacle or peak of sorts. No event was reciprocal, there was no theme except from a rags to riches story. Nature sometimes was described richly, but new objects of unfamiliarity and technology were glossed over, which is cool, as we're all aware of modern contrivances. It's just that everything I've mentioned makes the narrator fake. It's just sad. It means I'll never read this book again. Neither it nor I deserve it."

547,Candi,Little Women ,"Sep 10, 2019",5,"""I don‚Äôt believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do, in spite of our burnt hair, old gowns, one glove apiece, and tight slippers, that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them."" ‚Äì Jo March

Whether you like this book or not, I doubt there are many that would deny that Jo March is the star of this mid-nineteenth century novel about the March family. In many ways, because of this remarkably self-assured heroine, Little Women seemed to me much ahead of its time. Sisters Meg, Beth and Amy all have their moments to shine; while Mr. and Mrs. March are more broad-minded than what I imagine their contemporaries to have been. Had I been required to plant myself down in the midst of an American family during that era, I would have been satisfied to settle in with the Marches. 

Meg yearns for the fine things she once had before poverty knocked the Marches down a few notches; yet she retains a mother-like quality that warmed me to her. Beth is quiet, good-natured and pious; all her sisters look to her as the epitome of virtue. The artistic little Amy is spoiled and vain and dreams of someday becoming a moneyed gentlewoman. I admit to feeling a bit sorry for her and by book‚Äôs end I became a fan. People do grow up after all, don‚Äôt they?! 

And then there is Jo who adores books and dreams of someday becoming a writer. Described as a bit of a tomboy, which I suppose a girl with her pluck would have been commonly labeled back in the day, Jo is at the center of the novel. Given that Little Women is somewhat autobiographical in nature, it is fascinating to read of this spirited young woman. I can just imagine how she felt ‚Äì stifled by society‚Äôs norms and expectations of a Victorian ‚Äòlady‚Äô. She wanted the freedom to express herself; she would often have difficulty suppressing the pent-up rage that she felt deep inside; and she wanted to do what made her happiest. 

""An old maid ‚Äì that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps‚Ä¶""

She shared her hopes with Laurie, the boy next door and her greatest pal besides her dear sisters. They shared a love of literature and the outdoors and confided in one another their greatest dreams. 

""Wouldn‚Äôt it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true, and we could live in them?""

I read this story as a young teen and didn‚Äôt recall much of the plot. I have always carried a strong, positive image of Jo in my head during the intervening years; and I‚Äôm very glad I decided to reacquaint myself with her and the entire March family. I‚Äôm happy to say the image held up. With the exception of ever-sweet Beth, I would say that all of the girls exhibited growth throughout the book, and it was fun to spend some time with them. At times the story felt a bit over-sentimental, but I believe it was aimed at young women and given the date of publication, I decided to forgive it for this small ‚Äòcrime.‚Äô I‚Äôm all for a sweet from time to time, as long as it‚Äôs balanced out with something nutritious, and I believe I got both here. I am super-excited to see the upcoming screen version of this to be released on Christmas Day!

549,Alex,Gone with the Wind,"Jul 06, 2017",1,"Margaret Mitchell was a racist and in 1936, 70 years after the Civil War, she wrote a thousand-page love letter to racism. If you'd like to hear why slavery was terrific and black people are inferior to whites and they liked being slaves, here is your epic. If that sounds unpleasant, you won't like Gone With the Wind.

A non-racist book can have racist characters, and all the characters in this book are racist. Is the book itself necessarily racist? Yes. It has an omniscient narrator, and many long, racist passages that are clearly not from any character's perspective. They feel like the nonfiction interludes in War & Peace and they're racist. Is it possible Mitchell means for us to disagree with her omniscient narrator? No. There's no evidence whatsoever of that, and the omniscient passages that defend the South and slavery are written with passion and supported by racist scenes in the story. This book intends to be racist; Margaret Mitchell believes what she says; she was a racist person who wrote a hateful book. I can prove it and I'm about to.

We start off in the glory days of the Old South, as a young, callow, beautiful Scarlett O'Hara flirts with everyone's boyfriends. Happy slaves bustle around:
""The house negroes of the County considered themselves superior to white trash...they were well-fed, well-clothed and looked after in sickness and old age. They were proud of the good names of their owners and, for the most part, proud to belong to people who were quality."" 
We meet some of them, Scarlett's ""small white hand disappearing into their huge black paws and the four capered with delight at the meeting and with pride at displaying before their comrades what a pretty Young Miss they had.""

Faithful slave Mammy is introduced, with her ""kind face, sad with the uncomprehending sadness of a monkey's face"" - ""the mottled wise old eyes saw deeply, saw clearly, with the directness of the savage and the child, undeterred by conscience when danger threatened her pet."" Mammy is one of the few morally pure characters in the book, but it's always that noble savage quality.

Luckily Scarlett stays away from the slave quarters, where ""the faint niggery smell which crept from the cabin increased her nausea.""

But then war comes. Here's noble and boring Ashley, the limpest point of the oncoming love triangle, describing what the war is about. Notice that his vision of the South is indivisible from slavery:
I hear the darkies coming home across the fields at dusk, tired and singing and ready for supper, and the sound of the windlass as the bucket goes down into the cool well. And there's the long view down the road to the river, across the cotton fields, and the mist rising from the bottom lands in the twilight. And that is why I'm here who have no love of death or misery or glory and no hatred for anyone. Perhaps that is what is called patriotism.
After the War and during Reconstruction, things get really dark (get it? lol) as Northerners ruin black people: ""Some of the free negroes were getting quite insolent. This last [Scarlett] could hardly believe, for she had never seen an insolent negro in her life.""

But ""The [Freedmen's] Bureau fed them while they loafed and poisoned their minds against their former masters."" And here's much more from the omniscient narrator:
[They] furthermore told the negroes they were as good as the whites in every way and soon white and negro marriages would be permitted, soon the estates of their former owners would be divided and every negro would be given forty acres and a mule for his own. They kept the negroes stirred up with tales of cruelty perpetrated by the whites and, in a section long famed for the affectionate relations between slaves and slave owners, hate and suspicion began to grow.

[Now Southerners] were looking on the state they loved, seeing it trampled by the enemy, rascals making a mock of the law, their former slaves a menace, their men disenfranchised, their women insulted.
This eventually leads to the formation of the noble Ku Klux Klan, who merely attempt to protect Southern women from being raped by uppity former slaves. Here's a Klan member now:

""'Wilkerson had gone a bit too far with his nigger-equality business. Oh yes, he talks it to those black fools by the hour. He had the gall - the - ' Tony sputtered helplessly, 'to say niggers had a right to - to - white women.'""

""The negroes were on top and behind them were the Yankee bayonets,"" thinks Scarlett: ""She could be killed, she could be raped and, very probably, nothing would ever be done about it.""

And here's the omniscient narrator summing it up:
It was the large number of outrages on women and the ever-present fear for the safety of their wives and daughters that drove Southern men to cold and trembling fury and caused the Ku Klux Klan to spring up overnight. And it was against this nocturnal organization that the newspapers of the North cried out most loudly, never realizing the tragic necessity that brought it into being.
This is all demonstrated in the action. Scarlett O'Hara's headstrong ways nearly get every man in town hung. (view spoiler)[Her foolish habit of driving alone through the worst parts of town almost gets her raped by a freed slave, forcing the Klan to take action and lynch him, and they all almost get caught. Her second husband is killed. (hide spoiler)] Divorced from its context, this is a brilliant scene. It's done entirely from Scarlett's point of view, so the actual gun fight is totally off page. What we see instead is the wives, with Northern soldiers in their living rooms waiting for the men to return - surrounded by enemies, their faces frozen into nonchalant expressions, desperately and silently scheming to save their husbands' lives. It's great stuff, as long as you can forget that you're being asked to root for the KKK to get away with lynching a man.

And here's a pretty long series of quotes. Again, they're all from the omniscient narrator - that is, from the book itself. 
The South had been tilted as by a giant malicious hand, and those who had once ruled were now more helpless than their former slaves had ever been.

The former slaves were now the lords of creation and, with the aid of the Yankees, the lowest and most ignorant ones were on top. The better class of them, scorning freedom, were suffering as severely as their white masters...Many loyal field hands also refused to avail themselves of the new freedom, but the hordes of 'trashy free issue niggers,' who were causing most of the trouble, were drawn largely from the field-hand class.

In slave days, these lowly blacks had been despised by the house negroes and yard negroes as creatures of small worth...Plantation mistresses had put the pickaninnies through courses of training and elimination to select the best of them for the positions of greater responsibility. Those consigned to the fields were the ones least willing or able to learn, the least energetic, the least honest and trustworthy, the most vicious and brutish...[but now] the former field hands found themselves suddenly elevated to the seats of the mighty. There they conducted themselves as creatures of small intelligence might naturally be expected to do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects whose value is beyond their comprehension, they ran wild - either from perverse pleasure in destruction or simply because of their ignorance. 

To the credit of the negroes, including the least intelligent of them, few were actuated by malice and those few had usually been ""mean niggers"" even in slave days. But they were, as a class, childlike in mentality, easily led and from long habit accustomed to taking orders.
...
Here was the astonishing spectacle of half a nation attempting, at the point of bayonet, to force upon the other half the rule of negroes, many of them scarcely one generation out of the African jungles. 
...
Thanks to the negro vote, the Republicans and their allies were firmly entrenched and they were riding roughshod over the powerless but still protesting minority.

Man, just read that last sentence again. Wow.

Anyway, this is all very difficult for poor Scarlett: ""The more I see of emancipation the more criminal I think it is. It's just ruined the darkies. Thousands of them aren't working at all and the ones we can get to work at the mill are so lazy and shiftless they aren't worth having. and if you so much as swear at them, much less hit them a few licks for the good of their souls, the Freedmen's Bureau is down on you like a duck on a June bug.""

She complains that Northerners ""Did not know that negroes had to be handled gently, as though they were children, directed, praised, petted, scolded...How could anyone get any work done with free niggers quitting all the time?...[It's] too dear a homeland to be turned over to ignorant negroes drunk with whiskey and freedom.""

And with the final word, here's a former slave himself, Big Sam, who ""galloped over to the buggy,his eyes rolling with joy and his white teeth flashing, and clutched her outsretched hand with two big hands as big as hams. His watermelon-pink tongue lapped out, his whole body wiggled and his joyful contortions were as ludicrous as the gambolings of a mastiff. ... 'Ah done had nuff freedom. Ah wants somebody ter eed me good vittles reg'lar, and tell me whut ter do an' whut not ter do.'""

Okay, is that enough? That was gross to type out. And don't think I'm cherry-picking the only racist passages; this book is soaked in racism. God's nightgown, it's fuckin' racist. Pat Conroy, in a despicably fawning introduction, sees fit to mention that ""No black man or woman can read this book and be sorry that this particular wind is gone,"" and what the hell kind of thing is that to say? ""White people, on the other hand...you gotta be a little bummed out, right?"" Is that what you meant, Pat? 

And look, yes, it's too bad that this book has destroyed itself with hatred, because it's got a lot going for it. It certainly has Scarlett O'Hara going for it. She's fuckin' terrific, a towering antiheroine, amoral, selfish and brave - somewhat like the South itself. Rhett Butler, her swarthy and cynical love interest, is pretty good too, although he can't stop mansplaining amorality and he might have some kind of social learning disability. (He's also a murderer, by the way: ""I did kill the nigger. He was uppity to a lady, and what else could a Southern gentleman do?‚Äù) They have sortof a proto-50 Shades thing going on, including a fairly kinky love scene that's not explicitly described but Scarlett was definitely into it. Third love triangle corner Ashley sucks, no one cares about him.

It also taught me the phrase ""God's nightgown!"" which is certainly a great thing to yell.

But it is totally, irredeemably ruined by its racism. Look, I'm not trying to be ""politically correct"" here. That's not even a thing; it's a term made up by haters to excuse hate. Gone With The Wind angered me. I don't like hearing black people described as stupid monkeys over and over again. I didn't enjoy reading the book because I was constantly pissed off by how ignorant and hateful it is. It was racist at the time it was written; it's racist now; racism is the point and the message, and to ignore it is to disrespect its author's intentions, which were racist.

Books matter. We use stories to describe and define society. If we allow this book to become part of the foundation of our past - if we call it a classic, as some people have - we're basing our past on a terrible lie. And it is a terrible lie, in case we need to say that out loud: Slavery was bad, black people didn't like it, almost everyone else didn't either, and the South were the bad guys in the Civil War.

And books are also our companions. When we choose to read, we're spending significant amounts of time - hours and hours - deep in their worlds. This companion is full of hate. These hours and hours will be spent listening to her yell about insolent niggers. It's the most racist book I've ever read. I didn't like it."
550,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jan 11, 2021",2,"This is one of those very few books people either seem to love or hate. I wistfully belong to the latter half.


1) The character development of Henry and Claire were deplorable, especially after they became adults.

2) The narration and the plot were too complicated to follow, mainly due to switching to multiple periods via time travel.  After finishing this novel, I was exhausted like a flight attendant who had continuous work for 36 hours on different flights to different time zones without rest.

3) What was the real purpose of time travel in this book? The author fails to connect it with the reader

4) Was Henry in true love with Claire? It seemed more like a jealous, abusive type of relationship. The way he spoiled the childhood of Claire by time traveling to her childhood naked and marking her like an animal, telling her that he will be her future husband was ridiculous. He totally scarred Claire's youth, and she was not able to explore her life and relationships freely after that. We can see Ayn Rand's objectivism shades in how Audrey Niffenegger created Henry's character.





5) The way infertility and miscarriage are mentioned in this book is atrocious.

6) The way the author tried to create a didactic novel about true love by depicting sex with almost every tiny detail was ludicrous.

7) The way the protagonist tried to revisit his mother's death again and again using time travel to view it from multiple angles is hard to believe. If we have the power of time travel, we will go back to see the happy moments with a person instead of going back to revisit their accidental death multiple times. It was absurd, creepy, and sadistic to the core. It was just like Henry was celebrating disasters. Just look at how the author chronicles Henry revisiting his mother's death.
 ‚ÄúMy mother dying. I time travel to it, over and over. If you could be there and if you could hover over the scene of the accident, and you could see every detail about it. If you had time to look at everything, you would see me behind the cars, behind the bushes, on the bridge, on the tree. I have seen it from every angle.""  
 We can see glimpses of the author's brilliance in some areas of this book, and I truly loved her writing style in some parts of it. I had huge expectations when I picked up this book for reading. Sadly it didn't work out for me."
551,Maria,1984,"Feb 19, 2018",5,"I'm gonna ask myself a mandatory question and say nothing more.

Why the fuck had I not read this book before?"
552,Joanne Harris,The Secret Garden,"Jul 08, 2017",0,"Re-read this, after many years, as part of my children books experiment. Several revelations so far: One, the plot is basically JANE EYRE, with an asexual Rochester who keeps, not his wife, but his son, in the attic. Two, it's surprisingly easy to read the characters of both Mary and Colin as being on the autistic spectrum. (Her rudeness; her insensitivity to others, her obsessiveness: his tantrums; his introspection; his obsessions.) Three; the pantheism and everyday magic of the story is a lot more sophisticated than I realized as a child, as is the depiction of Nature and the landscape - quite Bronte-like in its intensity. Unexpected moment of joy: the many occasions on which young Mary exclaims with delight that she is getting fatter - fat repeatedly held up as a positive - a refreshing change from so many of the dysmorphic, anxious young girls of contemporary fiction. One jarring note to the modern reader: Mary's attitude towards the people of India; an uncomfortable reminder of the casual racism and arrogance of British colonialism. Overall, however, a lovely novel, subtle and captivating, that stands the test of time, and more."
553,Sean Barrs,Animal Farm,"Apr 16, 2017",2,"George Orwell leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. This is a blatant political statement. There‚Äôs no reading between the lines in order to ascertain the meaning, it‚Äôs all here on the page. After around page twenty it was very obvious how this book would end. History repeats itself and in this case it goes full circle. Nothing changes. And a wise old Donkey was the only one in the piece aware of this. We can presume he has seen it before, though, on a character level he was a bit of an ass not to tell anybody what was coming. See what I did there? I‚Äôm good. I know. 

The problem I had with  Animal Farm is that I could not engage with it. The characters aren‚Äôt really characters. The setting isn‚Äôt really a setting. And the plot isn‚Äôt really a plot. They are all mere devices, a means for Orwell to blurt out his political statement. The entire book is one big author filibuster, an entire situation and a group of characters created for the simple reason of showing Orwell‚Äôs opposition to communism and, more specifically, the Stalin regime. It‚Äôs cleverly written, and it is funny at times, but such direct authorial intention took something away from the reading experience. I couldn‚Äôt lose myself within the writing. 

The pigs were used as an insult to mankind. Their leader Napoleon (aptly named?) slowly distances the pigs from the animals of the revolution. They begin to take on the traits of humans, and after a few chapters they have set themselves up as the thing they originally usurped. They become corrupt and driven by money and profit. They‚Äôre above their peers, ultimately, destroying their own aims. By doing this Orwell is calling humans pigs; he is calling post-revolutionaries pigs. For me reading this, this was more of an insult to pigs than humans. Pigs are lovely animals. (Nicer than humans?) The metaphor certainly relies much on the reader‚Äôs interpretation of what a pig is. 

That‚Äôs me just being pedantic and silly, but I guess I just like pigs. And I feel like I‚Äôve read  Animal Farm before. I feel like I know this story, and that‚Äôs because it is the history of mankind; it is the history of revolution. So, needless to say, Orwell has captured a large sense of this on the page. When it has been read, it is definitely something that cannot be unread. The allegory is pertinent and, in a sense, an almost pessimistic truism, though the inner romantic in me finds such a defeatist attitude, well, defeating. 

It‚Äôs undoubtedly very intelligent writing, but I just didn‚Äôt enjoy it. When I read literature, whether it be poetry, play or novel, I like imagining things; I like coming up with my own interpretation, meaning, or criticisms. With this, Orwell has said it all. I feel like I didn‚Äôt need to read it, a plot summary would have given me everything the writing did.

- This is the first book I read on my 2017 reading challenge, I hope I enjoy the others more!"

555,Stephen,Brave New World,"Nov 17, 2010",3,"I need to parse my rating of this book into the good (or great), the bad and the very  fugly because I thought aspects of it were inspired genius and parts of it were dreggy, boring and living near the border of awful. In the end, the wowness and importance of the novel's ideas as well as the segments that I thoroughly enjoyed carried the book to a strong 3.5 star rating.

THE REALLY GOOD/EXCELLENT - I loved the first third of the book in which the basic outline of the ""Brave New World"" and its devalued, conveyer belt morality is set forth. The narrative device employed by Huxley of having the Director of Hatchery and Conditioning provide a walking tour to students around the facility as a way to knowledge up the reader on the societal basics was perfect. We learn of the cloning/birthing process, the caste system and the fundamental tenets upon which the society is organized.




This was as good a use of infodumping exposition as I had come across in some time and I was impressed both with the content and delivery method. The reader gets a crash course in world and its history in a way that fit nicely into the flow of the narrative without ever feeling forced. This was easily the best part of the novel for me, and Huxley's mass production-based society of enforced hedonism and anti-emotion was very compelling. Sort of like...
 



Now, long jumping to the end of the novel...

I also thought the final ""debate"" near the story's climax between John (the ""savage"") and Mustapha Mond, the World Controller, was exceptional. This last chapter/ending of the book, while abrupt, was masterful and struck the proper chord with the overall theme of the book. 

Thus, a superior 4.5 to 5.0 stars for this portion of the book. 

THE BAD/AWFUL - I thought the middle of the book including both the trip to the ""reservation"" and John's initial return to London was a sleeping pill and felt disconnected from the rest of the narrative. Throughout this entire portion of the book, all I kept thinking was...



The only purpose of this long, long.....LONG section seems to be to allow the reader to see Bernard Marx do a complete 180 in his views on the society once he finds himself in the role of celebrity by virtue of his relationship with John the savage. Sorry, this just did not strike me as a big enough payoff for this dry, plodding section. It was a test of endurance to get through this portion of the book, so I'm being generous when I give it a weak 2.0 to 2.5 stars. I could just have easily summed it up by just saying...




Bottom-line, I think this is a book that should be read. It's important book and there is much brilliance here. Plus, it is short enough that the stale boring segments aren't too tortuous to get through. However, as far as the triumvirate of classic dystopian science fiction goes...1984 is still the undisputed champ.

3.0 Stars. Recommended."
556,Nilufer Ozmekik,Pride and Prejudice,"Jul 11, 2020",5,"Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story takes place in the fictional town of Meryton, England, in the late 18th century. The novel follows the life of Elizabeth Bennet, a witty and independent-minded young woman, as she navigates the social mores of her time and falls in love with Mr. Darcy, a wealthy and proud aristocrat.
 
The novel begins with the arrival of Mr. Bingley, a wealthy gentleman, to Netherfield Park, a nearby estate. He is accompanied by his sisters and his best friend, Mr. Darcy. The Bennet family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters, including Elizabeth, is excited by the prospect of meeting the new neighbors. However, when Mr. Darcy snubs Elizabeth at a ball, she immediately takes a dislike to him, and he to her, due to his pride and her prejudice against him.
 
As the story progresses, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy encounter each other again and again, and their initial animosity gradually turns into attraction. However, their budding romance is threatened by a number of obstacles, including the interference of Mr. Darcy's haughty aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and the machinations of Mr. Wickham, a charming but untrustworthy gentleman who has a grudge against Mr. Darcy.
 
Throughout the novel, Austen skillfully explores the themes of class, gender, and social hierarchy in Georgian England. She depicts a society in which a woman's value is determined by her ability to marry well and secure her family's future, and in which the upper classes maintain their status through strict adherence to social norms and codes of conduct. However, Austen also shows how individuals can challenge and subvert these norms, through their intelligence, wit, and courage.
 
One of the novel's strengths is its vividly drawn characters, each of whom is unique and memorable. Elizabeth is a particularly appealing heroine, with her quick wit, strong opinions, and determination to live life on her own terms. Mr. Darcy, meanwhile, is a complex and intriguing hero, whose pride and sense of superiority are gradually revealed to be a cover for his vulnerability and insecurity.
 
Another of Austen's strengths is her prose style, which is witty, precise, and elegant. Her use of irony and satire adds depth and nuance to the novel, allowing her to critique the social norms and expectations of her time while still entertaining her readers.
 
The novel also offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of Georgian England, with its elaborate rituals of courtship, marriage, and social etiquette. Austen's keen observations of the manners and customs of the time, and her wry commentary on them, provide a richly detailed portrait of a bygone era. But at the same time, her characters are universally recognizable and relatable, making the novel as relevant today as it was when it was first published.
 
Moreover, Pride and Prejudice has had a lasting impact on popular culture, inspiring countless adaptations, retellings, and spin-offs in various media. From film and television adaptations to stage productions, comic books, and even video games, the novel's enduring appeal has ensured its place as a cultural touchstone for generations to come.
 
Overall, Pride and Prejudice is a timeless masterpiece of English literature, blending insightful social commentary with engaging characters, sparkling prose, and a deep understanding of the complexities of human relationships. It remains a beloved classic, treasured by readers and scholars alike, and its influence can be seen in countless works of literature and popular culture."
557,Barry Pierce,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Feb 06, 2014",4,"So I read all of Wilde's plays a couple of years ago but for some reason I never read this at the time. This is probably the number one most requested book for me to read. So I read it. Are ya happy now!? ARE YA!?

I really rather enjoyed this. Well, obviously. I mean, did you honestly think I wasn't going to like The Picture of Dorian Gray? It's by Oscar Wilde for fuck's sake. His prose is like spilled honey flowing across a wooden table and waterfalling onto the floor beneath. The viscous liquid flowing slowly over the edge. His plot, perfectly paced, moves slowly as we wade deeper and deeper into Dorian Gray's maniacal life. Over the edge we go as everything goes wrong, there's death, there's pain, there's long conversations about art. We hit the floor as we finish and we see nothing but sweetness amassing around us as we escape from Wilde's prose. Putting the book down you see the light has hit the stream and it glows and it shines and it sparkles and you stand there mesmorised by what you're witnessing and you put the book back on your shelf and feel sorry for the book you read next. 

So, yeah, it's good."
558,Jason Koivu,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Nov 22, 2008",3,"That's what I felt I was seeing as I read this, a blank slate, a void, an empty room. 

A Wrinkle in Time is a very nice tale, but I just wish L'Engle spent more time developing the settings. The decently rounded characters seemed to be floating in spartan landscapes like portraits hung in limbo. 

Lackluster description is one thing, but perhaps more than anything, I think my tepid-3 star, ho-hum reaction to A Wrinkle in Time is due to my reading it as a middle-aged curmudgeon. It's made for kids and I haven't been one of them in a while. 

My wife loved this book as a child and kept hinting I should read it, hinting so much that the hints became ultimatums. Could've sworn I heard her in my head shouting, ""Read this or you do not love me!"" So I read it and well...meh. I missed the age-appropriate boat on that one, I guess. But hey, at least I was smart enough not to give her my scathing review (yes, this would've been seen as a scathing review in her eyes). I just said, ""It was nice,"" and that's the story of how I managed to stay married.

559,Guille,Les Mis√©rables,"Dec 22, 2020",2,"Si usted lector se encuentra entre los miles y miles de entregados admiradores de esta obra tengo el deber de advertirle que las palabras que leer√°n a continuaci√≥n pueden herir su sensibilidad.

Los miserables es la narraci√≥n de una lucha a muerte. Una lucha que m√°s o menos se podr√≠a presentar de la siguiente manera:En la esquina derecha del ring, distinguido por una luz interior, de una magnificencia sobrehumana, vejado por las mayores injusticias, h√©roe de las m√°s despiadadas tragedias, ataviado con un abrigo amarillento, ra√≠do y entallado, con sombrero deformado: el ‚ÄúEX PRESIDIARIO ANGUSTIADO‚Äú‚Ä¶JEAAAAAN VALJEAAAAN, ¬°¬°¬°el √©xito del hombre, la encarnaci√≥n del perd√≥n!!!

Al otro lado, portador de enormes patillas, engalanado con un levit√≥n largo y esgrimiendo un garrote amenazador, con la mirada oscura, la boca fruncida y temible, y un gesto feroz de mando: ‚ÄúPERRO DE PRESAAAAAA‚Äù JAVEEEEERT, ¬°¬°¬°representante de la ley ciega, de la imposibilidad de la redenci√≥n, emisario plenipotenciario del castigo implacable y terrible como √∫nica respuesta al delito!!! Tan desigual combate se resuelve, como no pod√≠a ser de otra manera, por K.O en la quinta parte, libro tercero. Un triunfo que lleva aparejada la gran victoria de la idea que vertebra toda la novela: la bondad innata del hombre, esa bondad que permitir√°, m√°s tarde o m√°s temprano y gracias a la educaci√≥n universal, alcanzar el para√≠so en la tierra.

Esta ingenua idea del hombre junto con la descarada parcialidad exhibida no hubieran sido suficientes para molestarme en la forma en la que lo ha hecho. Es m√°s, el estilo de V√≠ctor Hugo, en contra de la opini√≥n de Flaubert ‚Äîincorrecto y vulgar‚Äî me ha parecido que alcanza, en no pocas ocasiones, una gran altura, que su lirismo apasionado, potente, su prosa derrochadora y rica me habr√≠an compensado sobradamente tal candidez y tan escandaloso favoritismo. Pero por lo que no hay compensaci√≥n posible, lo que soy incapaz de perdonar, es su portentosa necesidad de comunicarnos sus vastos conocimientos sobre los temas m√°s variopintos y aburridos, su viciosa inclinaci√≥n a apabullarnos con detalles y explicaciones cargantes e innecesarias, evitando as√≠ al torpe lector todo esfuerzo de su escasa imaginaci√≥n, su tendencia al retorcimiento de la historia hasta l√≠mites par√≥dicos, su gusto por los hechos sorpresivos, coincidencias inexplicables, encuentros inveros√≠miles y efectistas, su grave inclinaci√≥n al melodrama, a los amores castos y desgarradores, a los odios desaforados, a las intolerables miserias, su devoci√≥n por personajes que son encarnaciones puras, simples y asexuadas, s√≠mbolos de lo m√°s excelso y lo m√°s bajo del ser humano y siempre bajo el prisma rom√°ntico que sit√∫a lo emocional muy por encima de lo racional.

Conste que avis√©."
560,Dana Ilie,Jane Eyre,"Aug 09, 2013",5,"For years I've been saying that Jane Eyre is my favorite novel of all time--
and that it is. The character of Jane is, to me, one of the most admirable and appealing fictional characters of all time. Poor and plain she may be, but her spirit is indomitable.

In an era when women were expected to be brainless and ornamental, Jane (through the words of Charlotte Bronte) refused to bow to those expectations"
561,Kai Spellmeier,The Little Prince,"Jun 11, 2015",4,"‚ÄúIt is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.‚Äù

I remember, when I was little, I had this round CD case and it contained an audiobook. Now as a child I loved audiobooks, or someone reading stories to me. Still do today, actually. Anyway, the audiobook was titled The Little Prince, and I listened to it quite often. That, however, was at least 10 years ago, possibly more. So I decided that it was time for a reread. (I'm sorry to say that I cannot find the CD anywhere. Maybe my mom gave it away.)

Rereading this brought up nostalgia and melancholia. This is a very cute, very sad book, and I don't like the ending very much. I don't understand why the Prince couldn't just fly back to his planet. (view spoiler)[You know, instead of dying. Or did he die? Didn't he? I think he just left his body behind and returned anyway. But still...why make it so sad when it was already sad enough?

Okay, so let me get this out straight. I have never NOT finished a book before. Okay, I'm lying. The History of Sexuality Volume 1 by Michel Foucault remains unfinished as does Villette by Charlotte Bronte. Why? Because they were boring.

Because, as I read them, I wanted to take a cheese grater to my skull and rub vigorously just to have something to do!

But I have never NOT finished a Young Adult paranormal novel before. And I've read some BAAAAAD books. But I didn't finish this book because it goes beyond bad. It makes the History of Sexuality seem amazingly interesting and colourful.

To be fair to Ms. Clare, I was not actually ""reading"" her novel so much as listening to the Audiobook. The Narrator, Graynor, did a particularly craptastic job.

To be fair to Ms. Graynor, she didn't have much to work with. I tuned her out, I swear, I was focusing on the actual prose, taking in the story, trying to get interested. But the writing was terrible. It was painful. The characters were annoying.

Now, I've been fair to Ms. Clare and I've been fair to Mr. Graynor. So there's only you left to be fair to now.

And in order to do that, I have to admit that I wasn't EXPECTING to like this book. I was, however, expecting to be pleasantly surprised, and I'll explain why.

Many years ago, Cassandra Clare was Cassandra Clair - a VERY popular FF author in the Harry Potter and LoTR circles. I actually greatly enjoyed her Draco Trilogy. I've read it many times. I had heard that this book was very similar to DT and so I was expecting to find it to be a guilty pleasure. Something my moral compass told me to leave behind, but that I would actually enjoy too much to do so. But I was wrong.

Yeah, she plagiarized that work and I won't really go into it except to post a link because in the end, I'm not reviewing her, I'm reviewing her work.

But here's the problem. Jace is really just Draco from DT. Simon is really just Ron and Harry amalgamated into one. Clary is really just Ginny. The bad guys seems too much like good ol'Voldie. The plot is painfully similar to DT. It was like reading her old work all over again. And I think, because she was really just redressing her old characters, she didn't even both to give them any growth in this story.

To be honest, I didn't read far because the writing was boring (oh my lord, the similes! Someone save me from them) and poorly constructed; the characters were boring and poorly constructed and the plot was boring and poorly constructed.

I'd already read DT so I didn't need to read this."
565,Wigs,Divergent ,"Dec 03, 2011",2,"What kind of ridiculous mess...

Oh man.

So I know I say this in dissenting opinion, as many on my friends list are partial to this book, but I could not stand it. So before I go off on my tirade, I must explain. You may be thinking to yourself why I gave it two stars and not one, if I‚Äôm complaining so much. Let me explain that two is pretty low on my scale. Two is ‚Äúwhy did I buy this.‚Äù Or read this. Or whatever. One star is dramatic. One is ‚Äúthis should not have been written,‚Äù which I have given out as you may know. But no, I don‚Äôt believe that of Divergent. Roth has an interesting concept. It had potential. But it‚Äôs the execution of the idea that was just awful to me.

I felt like I could feel what the author was thinking. Regardless of whether or not this is true, this is what I felt the author was saying to me through my copy of Divergent (minorish, and a few obvious spoilers to follow, major spoiler hidden under cut, you‚Äôve been warned):

Research? Lol who needs to do that to write a book? No I know how to write a book, okay. I‚Äôve read other books so I know.

You know what was a good book? The Hunger Games. I liked Mockingjay as well, so I think I‚Äôm going to put them together and write a book just like that. Yea. Okay. Small petite girl, check. Dystopia, check. Living in an underground compound, check. Lessons about bravery and self-sacrifice, check. Small girl trains with other people who are jealous of her success, check. Kills people, check. (view spoiler)[ Boyfriend gets programmed to hate her and tries to kill her, check. (hide spoiler)] Good. I‚Äôve got all the elements of a good book. I‚Äôve even ended the last chapter with a train. Both The Hunger Games and Harry Potter did that. I‚Äôm going to be a YA legend.

What‚Äôs cool? Jumping on a moving train. What else is cool? Jumping off a roof. Oh yea that sounds cool. I‚Äôve seen that in a movie. Yea. What‚Äôs even cooler than that? ZIPLINING. I gotta think of more cool things, hold on. Gimme a second and I‚Äôll come up with another. 

Omg this book took me a WHOLE month to write. That‚Äôs like an eternity. Okay publishing time.

I‚Äôve read that she did write it in a month. Whether it‚Äôs true or not, I'd certainly believe it in a heartbeat. The whole thing is rushed and just‚Ä¶completely nonsensical and full of trope after trope. It seemed to me that there was little effort put into analyzing the world and zero research done for it, which is a reminder to any of us who are writers to always have a reason for something, and not just because it ‚Äúsounds cool.‚Äù This book is a treasure trove of COOL PEOPLE tropes and activities. Which doesn‚Äôt seem to work on me as I really can‚Äôt stand that breed of thrill-seeking people who‚Äôd rather risk their life doing stupid shit instead of‚Ä¶ you know, not. So what is supposed to be super awesomely cool people just, to me, looked like a band of idiots.

Before I break it down, let‚Äôs get one thing out of the way. Wigs, did you like anything about the book though? Yes. Yes I did. Let‚Äôs talk about what did work for me:

-Chapters 24 and 25. (lol, yes, out of the 39, I liked those two. She must have written those on a good night.) I feel like they kind of dropped all of the other outside nonsense and kind of focused on just human things. I think there‚Äôs a good writer in her, just not when she‚Äôs trying to be all dystopian and‚Ä¶ cool.

-Al‚Äôs storyline. And while Tris‚Äôs initial responses to Al made me rage, the story arc of Al really did move me emotionally and in a way that I was proud of Roth for doing so. Like cathartically I‚Äôm glad I felt these things over it.

-Some of her little details were nice touches. I enjoyed this particular one where Four was under a blue spotlight in a dark hallway it she described how his eyes were black and shadowed while the rest of his face eerily lit (or something like that.) Just here and there were some bits of description I liked.

And since I can‚Äôt think of anything else, let‚Äôs just move on. I like how it didn‚Äôt take me forever to read, but big font and spacing isn‚Äôt really a pro that counts for this.

Jeez this is starting to turn into Divergent: The Review, a novel by Wigs. But oh well. You can stop at any time. But I can‚Äôt. Not yet. I have to get this out of my head.

So here‚Äôs what I have issues with. And hey, if in book 2 she fixes some of these issues and answers some of the questions, great. I don‚Äôt care. Because someone can tell me ‚Äúoh but we learn about that in book 2!‚Äù all they want but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that after book 1 I‚Äôm thinking to myself ‚Äúwell that was completely stupid.‚Äù If you can‚Äôt convince me from book 1 to keep going then we‚Äôve got a problem, right?

So as you already probably know, this book is about this dystopian society that is divided up into five factions, based on personality traits, point being that you are assigned a career/lifestyle based on what you‚Äôre like. And that‚Äôs fine. I can believe that. I can believe that a dystopian society would force you into choosing a limited amount of careers based on what you excel in. My issue is that this society is completely dysfunctional. And I know that we‚Äôre supposed to be on the cusp of collapse and all, but there is a difference between dystopian and dysfunctional. A dystopian is scary for us, because ideally, it is supposed to be believable. We can believe The Hunger Games is possible because people would totally watch a reality show where people fight to the death. If you put that on tv right now, thousands, I‚Äôm sure, would watch it. In the case of Divergent, my issue is that this society is unbelievable. I‚Äôm not convinced that there was a way society could get to this point, because the details are so minimal and poorly thought out. Everything is very homogenized and simplified thusly into these factions and these careers (using the information given to us):

Abnegation (selfless people): healthcare, politics

Dauntless (brave people): guards, police

Erudite (knowledgeable people): research, reporting (and one would guess teaching?)

Amity (friendly people): farming

Candor (honest people): lawyers, and‚Ä¶?

Okay so seriously what does Candor even do? 1/5 of this society is lawyers? I don‚Äôt think so. I would have thought they would have at least done news/newspapers but we‚Äôre told that it comes from Erudite so I don‚Äôt even know. They seem pointless. Anything I can think of that might go with them is really better suited to Erudite.

And wait a minute. Healthcare is given to Abnegation? Wait really? Shouldn‚Äôt it be given to Erudite, since being in the medical field requires almost a decade of studying to learn how to do it? Or what, is it like homeopathic healthcare? How helpful.

You CANNOT tell me that one faction rules the government. There is NO WAY that when they set up the system people were like you know what's a good idea? Putting one group in all the power. That's ridiculous to say that something like that happens in Future America. There's no way they wouldn't have put together a system where there is representation from each faction within a council. (Isn't that what the American Revolution was all about? Lack of representation in government? I cannot see everyone saying 'fuck representation! let's all agree to give the government over to the selfless people'....and later being like OH WHOOPS we don't like this!) So the whole main plot of Divergent is based on something that's already broken my suspension of belief.

And what‚Äôs with everyone being white collar? And how blue collar jobs are for the factionless, which the author speaks of as if they‚Äôre on the same level as crazy homeless people. I sorely hope she doesn‚Äôt think that in real life. Tris speaks about them as if they‚Äôre pariahs. Construction workers, bus drivers, gasp, the horror. The villain wants to get rid of them. Oh yes. Oh yes. Get rid of your laborers, what villain who dreams of prosperity DOESN‚ÄôT get rid of the laborers? Hahaha Roth you‚Äôre killing me.

Okay, we need to talk about the train for a second. What. Is with. The Train. Why doesn‚Äôt it ever stop? (except for that one time when they rode it to the end of the city.) Why is this train an asshole? Didn‚Äôt jump on on time? Oops, you failed. Now you‚Äôre homeless. Loser. Oops, you fell off and now you‚Äôre dead. Lol we don‚Äôt stop the train here, bitch. Learn to live. (For a city that hasn‚Äôt seen murders in years, why does nobody give a shit when someone dies falling off the train? If random death isn‚Äôt common, why isn‚Äôt it horrifying? Why is everyone like just ignore it guys, just ignore it.) If it‚Äôs a Dauntless only train, why the fuck doesn‚Äôt it actually stop at the Dauntless compound. Oh yea because the Dauntless are stupid and have to make things ~death-defying.~ And how is it that the train tracks are both on the ground in front of the glass building and seven stories up at the roof of the glass building? I guess there‚Äôs two sets of tracks even though it wasn‚Äôt spoken about like that? Or otherwise the steepest track change in the world, haha.

AND WHY DO THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND? WHY? They had perfectly good empty buildings to refurbish, and instead they spend however many millions of dollars digging a bigass hole in the middle of the city just so people can enjoy some nice sunlight-deprived living. OH NO IT‚ÄôS JUST BECAUSE TRIS NEEDED TO JUMP OFF A ROOF INTO A BLACK HOLE. Yea okay now it all makes sense what a good idea I‚Äôm glad you came up with such a normal reason for an underground compound. Not like that they‚Äôre in hiding or privacy or anything sensical like that. Or maybe she just wanted to copy Mockingjay, that too, of course. I can‚Äôt forget that.

You know, all of this could have made sense if she just didn‚Äôt make it set in our world. She could have chosen, say, a Miyazaki type world where there‚Äôs a magical train that doesn‚Äôt stop, and a place where the people all live underground, and whatever. But no, this is freakin‚Äô future Chicago. And guess what people. In the future, the trains stop for no bitch, so watch out.

Okay okay I could go on forever about all the stuff I hate but I‚Äôm just gonna harp on two more topics and call it quits.

1)Why are the Dauntless so ridiculous? One thinks that a dystopian society would care about their military. Especially considering that in this case, their entire city is surrounded by a guarded fence with barbed wire. Clearly protection is important to them. So whyyyyyyy are the Dauntless, the only source of soldiers, completely undisciplined jackasses? They party it up and dress up like punks from 70s London and ‚Ä¶.train to fight MMA style for whatever reason (It‚Äôs COOL, Wigs, gosh) but why are they completely out of control? They all act like they‚Äôre 15. Let‚Äôs sneak out at night and go do shit wooooo! Why aren‚Äôt the initiates sent immediately to bootcamp style training, like an actual military. Instead we‚Äôre gonna capture the flag and you know, camp activities mixed in with boy-on-girl fist-fighting and knife throwing. And mental training which, while cool (there‚Äôs that magic word again), seems to serve no real life application aside from the ridiculous circumstances Roth cooks up. (view spoiler)[You know what? We‚Äôre not going to kill you normally. We‚Äôre going to put you in a box full of water because we know you think about that in your worst nightmares. We already had this ready too, for whatever reason. (hide spoiler)]

2) And how, HOW, HOW is everyone not Divergent? Why does Tris have special snowflake syndrome? We‚Äôre told that being divergent is basically having a mind which is suitable for multiple factions, not just one single faction. Which is dangerous etc whatever. And I can buy that, I can, that a dystopian society would want to suppress an individual which has too many skills or whatever butttttt‚Ä¶ how is it that SO few people actually have multiple skills. Seeing as things like selflessness and kindness go hand in hand, wouldn‚Äôt people be divergent for Abnegation and Amity? And wouldn‚Äôt people who speak their mind and are smart, a common pairing, be divergent for Candor and Erudite? And what about the people who‚Äôs tests tell them that they belong in one faction, but are allowed to choose another?? Why is that allowed, since it encourages them to learn more skills? (which is discouraged!) If they‚Äôre good at their chosen faction, and not the one that they were intended, doesn‚Äôt that make them divergent? And if they want to discourage people having multiple functions, why the hell are people allowed to change factions at all? Because if you‚Äôre raised one way and then learn a whole new way, aren‚Äôt you, in fact, becoming divergent by straddling the two worlds? It‚Äôs not like suddenly people forget everything, Christina still has her Candor traits even though she‚Äôs in Dauntless. I just don‚Äôt understand what seems to be this fatal flaw in Roth‚Äôs design. And because of this, I see how sad the wasted potential is. Why ISN‚ÄôT everyone secretly divergent? Wouldn‚Äôt that actually be making a statement on the nature of humans and how you can‚Äôt suppress them into single pieces and put them in a box? But no, no, Tris has a special brain. No one can get into her mind. Just like Bella Swan.

Speaking of which, with Tris, who is supposed to be divergent for Abnegation and Dauntless, I can barely find any selflessness traits outside of a what any regular person would do. I found her, in fact, written incredibly selfish, as teenagers are. It seemed that Roth didn‚Äôt realize (or did she?) what a jerk she was writing Tris to be (omg why are my friends so jealous of me??? Omg he‚Äôs so gross but lol someone likes me that‚Äôs so cool.) She also has to point out physical features to add to why she doesn't like people (greasy hair, crooked teeth, stretch marks, pudge....didn't you know that all bad people are also ugly? Duh.)

Ugh I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm going to stop talking, that is enough, Wigs. Basically it comes down to this. I didn‚Äôt buy 90% of the stuff I was being fed. Eye-rolling was induced many a time. The ending was just about every clich√© from an action movie I could think of. (view spoiler)[AND WHY DID YOU KILL WILL? WHY? YOU SHOOT ERIC IN THE FOOT, PETER IN THE ARM, PEOPLE YOU HATE, BUT THEN WILL, ONE OF YOUR ONLY FRIENDS, IN THE HEAD? IT WASN‚ÄôT EVEN A RAGE KILL. YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD US YOU AIMED AT HIS HEAD. RIGHT AFTER YOU SAID YOU KNEW IT WASN‚ÄôT HIS FAULT. RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO WAKE UP ALL THE DAUNTLESS AS THEY DIDN‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OH YEA THAT‚ÄôS RIGHT WE NEEDED A KILL-YOUR-FRIEND SCENE. CUZ THAT‚ÄôS WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE STORIES, RIGHT? (hide spoiler)]

I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry everybody, for being a grump. But I just can‚Äôt with this. I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt deal. A book without a solid platform of sense is just not for me."

‚ÄúDo I love you? My God, if your love were a grain of sand, mine would be a universe of beaches.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you,' Buttercup said. 'I know this must come as something of a surprise to you, since all I've ever done is scorn you and degrade you and taunt you, but I have loved you for several hours now, and every second, more. I thought an hour ago that I loved you more than any woman has ever loved a man, but a half hour after that I knew that what I felt before was nothing compared to what I felt then. But ten minutes after that, I understood that my previous love was a puddle compared to the high seas before a storm.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho says life is fair, where is that written?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am your Prince and you will marry me,"" Humperdinck said.
Buttercup whispered, ""I am your servant and I refuse.""
""I am you Prince and you cannot refuse.""
""I am your loyal servant and I just did.""
""Refusal means death.""
""Kill me then.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seem a decent fellow,"" Inigo said. ""I hate to kill you.""
You seem a decent fellow,"" answered the man in black. ""I hate to die.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is my favorite book in all the world, though I have never read it. ‚Äú"
567,Sean Barrs,The Book Thief,"Nov 21, 2015",5,"I devoured this. I read it, then I read it again, and now I want to read it for a third time.

 I‚Äôve really got to move on, but this was just so Good with a capital G. This book takes such an interesting perspective on a very written about period of history. Having Death as the narrator for parts of the story really took it to the next level; it made it utterly unique. It also created a sense of detachment from the events, and evoked the message that death is unavoidable and will eventually come for all. I loved it, and I think the heroine is just superb.

 A book thieving heroine? Say no more! 

 
 

 

For me, one of the most important aspects of a well written character is someone I can sympathise with and feel vast quantities of empathy for. So, when the protagonist is in love with reading and appreciates the freedom it can grant, I find myself somewhat immediately won over to her cause. Liesel‚Äôs story is woe begotten and tragic yet she always seems to carry on; she always seems to realise that there are good things in this world. And they‚Äôre not just books; they‚Äôre people too. She doesn‚Äôt give up and fall into a pit of self-pity. You‚Äôve got to hand it to her for that. For a young girl she is incredibly strong. She‚Äôs written so well; it‚Äôs so easy to invest in her story and wish for her to have an ending she deserves. But, death, by its very nature, doesn‚Äôt work that way. 

‚ÄúA small fact:
You are going to die....does this worry you?‚Äù 

Indeed, Death is cold and undiscriminating; he can come at any time and take anyone. I should have known this was going to be a sad one. Death pretty much said so from the start. But one can hope: one can hope that someone who has gone through so much will get a happy ending, though that‚Äôs not the point of this book. I‚Äôm saddened by the ending, but it was necessary. This book‚Äôs impact would have been marginally lessened if the deaths didn‚Äôt happen at the end. At least Liesel found some degree of comfort, which lifted the veil of misery somewhat. The ending of this book is precisely what made it so powerful. I wouldn‚Äôt want it‚Äôs sadness any other way. 

 A fantastic story 

Liesel is an orphan, and when she was adopted I expected her to have an absolutely terrible time. I expected her adopted parents to be awful. This just seemed like the predictable route this story would take, and I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt go that way because Liesel learnt the value of human kindness. In the Hubermann household she received warmth and comfort. Hans Hubermann is an excellent man; he is open-hearted and genuine in his affection. He is everything the young orphan needed in a parent, and he is everything that was needed to balance the darkness in the book. He is a true figure of strength and someone who represents the underappreciated resistance to Nazism within Germany during WW2. He refuses to become a member of the political party and even hides a Jew in his basement. He‚Äôs a good man, a great man. 



He is Liesel‚Äôs rock and figure of morale guidance. He‚Äôs a great character. I know I keep saying that but it is so true. Everything about this book is just brilliant. I think this is such an accomplished story. It takes a lot to write a book like this, and to end it like this. The temptation to end it differently must have been humongous. It‚Äôs refreshing to see a modern story actually end how it should rather than the easier route of a happy ending. This certainly won‚Äôt be the last book I‚Äôll be reading by Marcus Zusak. 

 An outstanding five stars

568,Houston,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Nov 13, 2007",5,"‚ÄúUntil I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.‚Äù(p. 20)

I love this book and this idea of reading being like breathing. As Scout did, I read early too, and often. Every night before bed I would read and still do. I saw a Twilight Zone Episode once where the main character loved to read and only wanted to be left alone to do so. After falling asleep in the vault of the bank where he worked, he awoke to a post-disaster world where only he was left. He busily gathered together all the books he wanted to read, all organized and stacked up. Just as he chose one to start with, his glasses fell and he stepped on them trying to find them. It was terrible and I remember feeling horrified that this man would never get to read again! Such a thought had never occurred to me. This semester I had to get glasses myself after suffering migraines from reading. I was so nervous at the eye doctor because the thought of not being able to read was too much for me. Of course, I only needed readers, but when I ran across this quote, I thought about how much like breathing reading is for me. 


‚ÄúSimply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win.‚Äù (p. 87)

Never say die! Fight the good fight no matter what! I love the anti-defeatist message in this quote. Even though Atticus knows the deck is stacked against him, he tries anyway. He understands that sometimes you have to fight the un-winnable fight just for the chance that you might win. It makes me think that what he‚Äôs trying to teach his children is never to give up just because things look dim. 


‚Äú...before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.‚Äù (p. 120)

As Shakespeare said, ‚ÄúTo thine own self be true.‚Äù That‚Äôs really all that matters. At the end of the day, when you lay down, you have to know that you did the right things, acted the right way and stayed true to yourself. Again, Atticus understands that the town is talking; he has to explain to his kids why he continues against the tide of popular thought. He sums it up so well here.

‚ÄúWe never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.‚Äù(p. 320) 

I love the sad way this quote sounds. It is clearly the thoughts of a child, for hadn‚Äôt Scout just given Boo his dignity as they were walking home? Hadn‚Äôt she and Jem given him children to care for and watch over? But she knows too, even from her child‚Äôs perspective, that they could never give him anything close to what he had given them‚Äîtheir lives. It just sounds so beautifully sad.

569,Sean Barrs,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ,"Apr 29, 2014",5,"Despite this being the longest book in the series, I read it quicker than all the others.

 Here‚Äôs three things I really loved about it: 

1. Harry and Sirius- they never had much time together but the time they did have really influenced Harry‚Äôs development, a few wise words from a sincere friend (or godfather) can go a real long way. And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me, we all know what happens next: 





2. Dumbledore‚Äôs Army- Harry, Ron and Hermione have always taken matters into their own hands; they‚Äôve never waited for someone to come along and save them. And here they have got so many great characters involved in their heroics, which leads me onto my next point. 



3. Luna Lovegood- because the weird people are always the best people. Luna‚Äôs by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she‚Äôs often ignored, avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant. The world needs more Luna Lovegoods. I always thought she had far more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did."

I‚Äòve been eyeing this edition for a while and was circling it for the last few days. When I checked this morning, the delivery date shown was before Christmas. So this is now officially my Christmas present to myself.

*+*+*
I love Lord of the Rings. I doubt I can add anything of value to the discussion, that hasn't already been written about LOTR.

 I had a one-volume-edition once, like Tolkien intended it. It looked a bit daunting at first. I had meant to read the book for 20 years or so, but never dared to tackle it. Then the first movie came out. I decided to watch it and then read the book as far as the movie went. Then wait for the second movie, read the second part of the book, wait for the third movie... You get the idea. 

That plan went down the drain, when (view spoiler)[Gandalf fell into that chasm! As soon as I came home, I grabbed the book and flicked pages to find out, if he was really dead...  (hide spoiler)]

I then tried to stick to the plan, but just had to keep reading. It still took me a month to get through it, but I enjoyed it very much. I have never re-read it, because I am a little scared that I wouldn't love it as much anymore. And no, the first 100 pages did not bore me at all, and I mean that."
571,Jesse,A Game of Thrones ,"Jun 15, 2007",5,"I know no one reading this knows me much (well some of you may) but I DON'T reread books. I usually read a book once and its quite well locked into my brain. As much as I've enjoyed many books I've read, they just don't require a second read for me. I read them, now its time to move on. ""A Game of Thrones"" is different. I loved this book and its characters so much, and crave the world and narrative so much that I couldn't wait for Martin to get the newest installment out. So I started rereading the first book I've ever reread.

Let me just say that I didn't find ANY of the characters boring. Even the characters that I would find an anoying personality type, are deeply engrosing in this tale. And those types of characters number just 2 for me in this book. There are so many characters, with such a broad range of personalities that there is someone to match everyones likes. Yet even the characters I initially found myself repulsed by, grow and change and are just as fascinating as those that I admire and empathize with. 

Normally I dislike when an author has too many characters and jumps from character to character from one chapter to the next, not so in this book. Martin's ability to tell a story and hook you on it, is so great that I started to look forward to these jumps to different characters. With this many characters you really are provided with a great narrow and broad picture of the currents of this world and narrative. Its like watching individual storms all over the globe, all adding up to the global weather system.

Which leads me to my next point, his pacing. I've read my share of epic fantasy series. In particular Martin's two major contemporaries/rivals for the top spot of the epic fantasy genre: Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan. Both these authors have good parts, and bad parts to their books. There are momments in their books where I stop and think, ""That was the  coolest thing (event) I've ever read"". Yet there are way more parts in both author's works where I was thinking ""when are we going to get to the next awsome and exciting event? Why are we still walking/riding/working/...etc(you get my drift)"". I came to expect this in any book, particularly epic fantasy. I just thought that when a book/series gets as long as these tomes, you end up having to spread some borring filler in there because one imagination can only do so much exciting work. Martin broke that mold for me. I kept waiting for a momment where part of my mind would start, metaphorically, tapping its foot in bordom thinking, ""are we there yet?"". It never happened. Each chapter would grab me, and by the time the chapter ended I was groaning at having to leave behind this story thread because I was wrapped up in its narrative path. Then I'm instantly swept up by the events of the next chapters story thread.

Finally there is the commitment by the author to this narrative. Many stories have jeopardy but you kind of know that in the end, the main character can't die, there are more books to come. Don't ever count on that in ""A Game of Thrones"". Everyone of the characters is fair game, and people/characters will die in horrible and tragic ways. In this book and in subsequent ones in the series, I literally threw down the book and got up in shock. Sometimes even shouting out to no one at all, ""Oh my GODS!, he killed !"". It gives me confidence in Martin and his own level of commitment to telling me the best and most real story possible, complete with unfair and tragic events happening to good AND bad people (though in the case of the bad people I suppose it would be ""fair and happy"" when negative things happen to them..lol). Ok, thats it, I can't believe how much I wrote here. Hope this gets some folks to read this book. Cause once you read the first, you'll be hooked.

03/22/2009: I just finished re-reading this book, and have to say it was even better the second time around. I caught subtleties to the plot that I never caught before, particularly about Jon Snow, Lyanna Stark, and Eddard Stark. I also found it interesting how much more the tension in the book was increased for me because I knew certain great momments were coming in the book, and the tension that created for me was most enjoyable. This is quite possibly THE best first book in a fantasy series I've ever read. I can't wait to re-read book #2 now, if only I had more time to read!"

573,Mer,The Da Vinci Code ,"Apr 12, 2007",1,"PLEASE do NOT recommend The Da Vinci Code to me because you think it's brilliant. Please do not try to explain to me that it is a ""really interesting and eye-opening book."" Just don't. Please. 

I've read Iain Pear, I heart Foucault's Pendulum, Dashiell Hammett is my hero, Alan Moore is My Absolute Favorite, I listen to Coil on a fairly regular basis, and cloak n' dagger secret society/Priory of Sion/Knights of Templar-tinged num nums make me a very happy girl... but if you truly believe that Brown's stupid airport thriller has ANY right whatsoever to be placed in the same category with Michael ""Wooden Dildo Dialogue"" Crichton, let alone Umberto Eco, kindly keep this opinion very far away from me, or the ensuing conversation we have will not be constructive or polite in any way.

I loathe Dan Brown. I resent him for spoon-feeding the masses pseudo-intellectual ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" D-grade thriller shite under a pretense of real sophistication, and getting orally serviced by The New York Times for his effort.

I'd heard that the novel was meticulously researched and contained some really interesting and controversial assessments of religious zealotry. Um, not really? Well, not by my Merovingian standards, anyway. :D

Let's put it this way. If Dan Brown was teaching an Insurgent Christian Symbolism in Art and Literature 101 class at my local community college, I'd definitely have a different opinion about him. 

But NO. Dan Brown is not a professor of anything but pap. He is a barely competent thriller writer who wrote an AWFUL book that I could not bear to finish because I felt my IQ plummeting a little further with every ""Let's Go to Paris! Guidebook"" description and blowhard authorial essay. Oh, don't even get me started about those cute soliloquies the main characters are so fond of delivering, ever so calmly, often while cops n' bovvers are chasing them.

The characters are weakly drawn. The dialogue is excruciating. The research is shoddy and self-serving at best. The plot, no matter how open-minded you are, is beyond ludicrous. It's laughable enough to be incorporated into the next Indiana Jones movie. That'd be sweet, dude.

What really irks me are Dan Brown's sanctimonious interviews, wherein he shows off all of his priceless antiques while expressing his abiding convictions that the American public needs a ""deeper appreciation"" of art and history and culture. What a shallow, self-aggrandizing hypocrite. I'm all for fictional subversion of the dominant Catholic paradigm, but only if the subverter knows what the hell they're talking about. Brown DOESN'T. He's all ""la la la, connect the dots"" but the picture he comes up with is awkward and unconvincing.

The DaVinci Choad is a dead easy, nay, downright lazy read, and yet droves of people are patting themselves on the back for having read and *gasp* actually understood it. Like this is some spectacular achievement? WHY? What, because the slipcover describes it as ""erudite""? Are you fucking kidding me?

Don't believe the hype, kids. You are profoundly more intelligent than this holiday page-turner gives you credit for.

If you really, honestly, just plain liked the book, that's cool I guess. Maybe you also prefer Anne Geddes to Alfred Stieglitz, Kenny G to Sidney Bechet, John Tesh to Igor Stravinsky. Your prerogative. Just.... please don't try to tell me that this is ""fascinating"" or ""meaningful literature"". Frickin' read The Club Dumas or something. Then we'll talk, and I won't want to shoot myself in the face.

Alright, glad I purged that poison from my system. Carry on."
574,Nicko,Gone with the Wind,"Feb 25, 2008",4,"** spoiler alert **
           So much has been said in praise of this book it feels redundant to add more. In terms of the slave-holding society, the film actually toned-down the pro-South view of Reconstruction (Scarlett's second husband joined the KKK in the book) and Mammy remains probably one of the most fully-developed and likeable African-American characters from 1930 you'll read. 

Rhett Butler is the consummate alpha male. This book is definitely the timeless classic reputation it has earned, and though at times it seemed like the longest book ever, it is all worth it in the end. It touches on many misunderstood aspects of the civil war and its afterwords. What many people do not realize is how horrible it really was for Southerners after the war, mostly because they cannot get past the racism of the times (which it wasn't as if the North was full of equality and peace, either). If you can accept the times for what they were, you will see how well this book was written. I appreciate it for the well built characters, smooth flow, and albeit romanticized- depiction of the Antebellum South.

As far as being politically incorrect or the modern charges that the book is ""racist,"" remember that this book was written in the 1930s. Not to mention, the time period is the Civil War era! To be completely unracist would not have depicted the era correctly. As if it represents anything more than the way people thought when it was made. Of course, it's racist. America is and has been a racist society since the beginning. This book mirrors the opinions held by the people alive and working at the time, no more and certainly no less. Have opinions changed since then? Of course, as society evolves so does the writing. All this aside, the character of ""Mammy"" is one of the most likeable and respected characters in the book. Rhett Butler treats her very well, and tries to win her approval. She‚Äôs the one person throughout the novel who sees through everyone‚Äôs follies and foibles, but remains forgiving of them anyway. There's a reason this book won so many awards and still endures! It is a timeless classic that everyone should enjoy and read in context."

this is probably my most read book of all time so having to reread it for millionth time to continue on with the series was kind of like pulling teeth. listened to the audiobook by mae whitman which wasn't bad. but even on 2.6x speed it kinda dragged for me.

because i knew eeeeeverything that was going to happen idk.

i still fucking love herondales. yall can choke, idc idc idc.

on to the next one."

Sin duda la relectura me ha hecho disfrutarlo infinitamente m√°s, no s√© si es que me he hecho m√°s rom√°ntica, m√°s blanda o qu√© pero en fin, que me he enamorado de cada p√°gina, de cada matiz de la historia.
Me quedo sin duda con dos cosas, por un lado con la ambientaci√≥n oscura y fantasmal y por otro con el personaje de Jane que ha conseguido colarse entre mis predilectos (y eso que la primera vez que le√≠ el libro me pareci√≥ una sosa, ¬°¬øEn qu√© estaba pensando!?)
Rochester no tienes perd√≥n como ser humano pero como personaje eres de 10 xD
En fin, una lectura maravillosa e inolvidable que adem√°s he tenido el placer de compartir con mis brujos del Aquelarre, lo que lo hace todo mucho m√°s disfrutable
***Eso s√≠, despu√©s leed 'El ancho mar de los Sargazos' de Jean Rhys para descubrir la parte de historia que nos falta......."

9 / 5 / 2022"
578,Michael Finocchiaro,Gone With the Wind,"Aug 15, 2021",5,"What an epic read! Mitchell‚Äôs white supremacist mentality aside, the characters of Scarlett and Rhett are sublime. I wonder if they are not the most selfish, egotistical characters in all of literature. Ok, so Rhett shows a bit of a human side in the end thanks to Bonnie, but for most of the book, he seemed to me as unscrupulous as Stendahl's Julien Sorel of the epic Le Rouge et le Noir. The unrequited and ultimately fruitless love of Ashley and Scarlett was torture throughout. It is one of those books where you want to scream at Scarlett for her actions over and over again. It also occurs to me that there would never have been a Sam and Diane had there not been a Scarlett and Rhett beforehand. The author did such a superb job of describing the inner life of her protagonists and highlighting this against their actions in the real world. The war scenes were gripping (despite an extreme pro-Confederacy bent) and the burning of Atlanta so well-described. I found it interesting that this all happens in the first 20% of the novel and the following 80% was about Reconstruction. 

My second sentence generated some commentary, so I think I should set down my justifications a bit. I would base my phrase ""white supremacist viewpoint"" along four axes:
1/ paternalistic, condescending description of black characters 
All of the POC in the book are described as mental children and/or sources of extreme, incomprehensible violence (the attempted rape of Scarlett is a big example). The characters that get slightly better treatment (Uncle Pete, Porc, and especially Mammy) are those who are submissive and grateful to their ""employers"". In general, they are never treated as equals or as humans, but rather as chattel and with no aspiration to humanity. True, as Jillian mentions in the comments, that Mammy does mention that she is free, but her comment is ignored and incomprehensible to Scarlett. There is not a single example of a solid POC character with a soul and a truly independent destiny. 
Jillian points out below that Mitchell's real views were probably more nuanced, but the book clearly places a paternalistic or animalistic filter on all descriptions of POC.

2/ the revisionist description of slavery
Slavery is presented as a given, a necessary state for adapting white life in the South to a labor-intensive agrarian economy. There is no description of the violence of overseers (Jonas being a shitheel but an import from the North), no hint of the systematic rape of black slaves (producing generations of bastards, all missing from this description), and mocking derision of the release of Uncle Tom's Cabin when it is released and read by the characters. 
Again, this is a comment on the book but also about the writer as if she wanted to, she could have presented alternative points of view (through, say, a minor character or something).

3/ defensive view of the Klu Klux Klan
The KKK is presented as a justifiable response to the post-Civil War chaos in the South and its participants are all described as heroes to the Cause. The only incidence of violence directly referred to was the revenge taken against the attempted rape of Scarlett (granted that she is saved by her ex-slave Big Sam) and nothing of the random lynching and domestic terrorism. True that Ashley tries to work against it, but even he is drawn in with Frank into Klan violence resulting in his being shot and Frank Kennedy, Scarlett's second husband, being killed.
 
4/ paens to the Lost Cause
Lastly, there are the passages particularly towards the end of the book, where the author will spend pages to describe the victimhood of Atlanta and Georgia in general with no counterpoint. It was particularly deplorable when she describes (with implicit agreement) the violent reaction to the fifteenth amendment (the right for POC to vote). It is not mentioned that the white planter class was justifiably disenfranchised as punishment for having broken with the Union in open rebellion. Never once does Mitchell give a sympathetic word for abolition, for Lincoln, or for anything north of the Mason-Dixon line. One could argue that she was being journalistic and detached, but these passages serve no purpose in the overall narrative and seem to me that they are the author's own viewpoint being overlayed on the story. 
I think that the nuance here is in how characters react to the dissolution of the South:
""Well, this is the reason. We bow to the inevitable. We're not wheat, we're buckwheat! When a storm comes along, it flattens ripe wheat because it's dry and can't bend with the wind. But ripe buckwheat's got sap in it and it bends. And when the wind has passed, it springs up almost as straight and strong as before. We aren't a stiff-necked tribe. We're mightly limber when a hard wind's blowing, because we know it pays to be limber. When trouble comes we bow to the inevitable without any mouthing, and we work and we smile and we bide our time. And we play along with lesser folks and we take what we can get from them. And when we're strong enough, we kick the folks whose necks we've climbed over. That, my child, is the secret of survival.""  (p. 670) 
This all sounds like the classic grifter mentality to me and Scarlett and Rhett are nothing if not grifters if we are honest: Grab what you can when you can. It is ironic that the speaker says that the south isn't stiff-necked because that is one of the most characteristic features of Southern thinking.
In one of Mitchell's monologues/harangues about the South:
With the Republicans in the political saddle the town entered into an era of waste and ostentations, with the trappings of refinement thinly veneering the vice and vulgarity beneath. Never before had the cleavage of the very rich and the very poor been so marked. Those on top took no thought for those less fortunate. Except for the negroes, of course. They must have the very best. The best of schools and lodgings and amusements, for they were the power in politics and every negro vote counted. But for all the recently impoverished Atlanta people, they could starve and drop in the streets for all the newly rich Republicans cared. (p. 914)
The argument ""always the best for the blacks, and nothing for whites"" has been the rallying cry for white supremacists even up to today. The ""very best"" not truly having been granted because they are still the poorest population in the South and in Georgia in particular. Of course, there were opportunists and grifters among the carpetbaggers, but let us not forget that both Rhett and Scarlett also took full advantage of the chaos to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor. There is even an exchange where Scarlett explicitly states that she prefers taking advantage of the poor because there is less chance of repercussions and they are there to be taken advantage of. I saw this as wanting your cake and eating it too. 
I would also point out that the resistance to the black vote was especially present with the white women and that this racist viewpoint continued up to Mitchell's day (in the equivalent to Mellie's various sewing circles) in the struggle for suffrage in which white women wanted the vote at the expense of that of POC. I.e., since the 15th gave black MEN the right to vote, the suffragettes were fighting only for WHITE women's right to vote, not for women of color.

That isn't to say that there is not a lot of nuance in GWTW. There is an interesting commonality of antiwar sentiment in Ashley and Rhett - both are against the war but for entirely different reasons. For Ashley, he can't stand the violence and yet still goes off to fight from the get-go based on his romantic principles of fighting for the Cause and his lost colonial dream. For Rhett, he knows that the South will ultimately lose and decides to profit from the war as much as possible, only joining the Cause at the last gasp in Johnston's Tennessee campaign, abandoning a freaked-out Scarlett after fleeing a burning Atlanta (one of the most gripping scenes in the book!

The studio shooting the film burned dozens of old studios in Hollywood to make the effects as realistic as possible). There is also a lot of nuance in the way Scarlett and Ashley never quite become adults and how Scarlett is FINALLY aware of this towards the end (when it is too late), but Ashley never quite makes it over the hill to adulthood and even after losing Mellie, he remains unreachable by Scarlett.

The primary romance in the novel is, of course, the epic story of Scarlett and Rhett which takes several hundred pages to turn into a marriage and just one birth to turn into a fiasco. I did love the description on page 793 of Scarlett's honeymoon in New Orleans that despite loving the time there, she left without knowing anything about him. She is so egoistic and narcissistic that she can only see Rhett's love when it is truly too late and Rhett has to give her a dose of hard love with his famous line, ""my dear, I don't give a damn.""


However, I had forgotten the other leg of the love triangle between Scarlett and Ashley. I love this paragraph:
For a moment, his eyes came back to her, wide and crystal gray and there was admiration in them. Then, suddenly, they were remote again and she knew with a sinking heart that he had not been thinking about starving. They were always like people talking to each other in different languages. But she loved him so much that, when he withdrew as he had now done, it was like the warm sun going down and leaving here in chilly twilight dews. She wanted to catch him by the shoulders and hug him to her, make him realize that she was flesh and blood and not something he had read or dreamed. If she could only feel that sense of oneness with him for which she had yearned since that day, so long ago, when he had come home from Europe and stood on the steps of Tara and smiled up at her."" (p. 499). 
This is a nice resum√© of the central contradictions in the novel: while Ashley says he loves Scarlett (implicitly for the most part admittedly), he really only wants her for a lover whereas when Rhett says he wants her as a lover, he actually loves her. It is this tension that vibrates throughout and makes it such an exhilarating read. 

Another thing I found interesting was the fact that Scarlett was from a very Catholic family because today's South is so overwhelmingly Protestant/Baptist and so very anti-Catholic. And the 20th-century incarnation of the KKK was violently anti-Irish and anti-Catholic while upholding GWTW as a fundamental text. Let us not forget that overall GWTW sales in the US are only exceeded by those of the Bible. Oh, the irony.

It is truly the ambiguity in the characters and the extraordinary dialogs that make this such a great piece of literature, and that is why, despite my lengthy expos√© above about the inherent white supremacy in the work, that I still could truly enjoy it as literature. It is an obvious classic that deserved its Pulitzer without reserve.


I haven't watched the movie in many, many years, but I do recall some of the more epic scenes and as I mention in a comment below, I think it has only been equaled in Visconti's adaptation of Il Gattopardo on the silver screen in terms of a 19c drama with costumes and balls. Not only that, but the background of Lampedusa's masterpiece is very similar: the characters in both live through a civil war that destroys their way of life and opens up a new era, and we get to observe how each of the protagonists copes with the new reality, whether they sink or swim. In both cases, the writing is superb and in both cases, the film versions are among the greatest films ever produced.

I just rewatched the movie and wanted to make a few comments. First off, Vivian Leigh is breathtaking throughout and Clark Gable shows a great character arc through the movie from debonair, devil-may-care pirate and womanizer to caring father to bereaved father and back to cynical loner again. The film cuts out Scarlett's babies with George and Frank and accelerates some events (Gerald dies much earlier), but essentially captures the primary events and best dialogs from the book. I think the film was even more racist than the book in some ways (certainly the scrolling text made me cringe at many points in the film), and yet they did not cut the scene where Scarlett gives Pork Gerald's gold watch and the scene where Scarlett confronts Ashley about his hypocrisy about opposing prison labor at the mill while having no qualms with slave labor. They also pass over the fact that Frank and Ashley are in the KKK on a raid on the fateful night after the attempted rape (this only hinted at by the expression on the white man's face, the director having decided for whatever reason not to have the black actor rip apart her bodice as in the book version - too shocking for an audience in the late 30s perhaps? The scene of Scarlett crossing the rail yard looking for Dr Meade when Mellie is giving birth and the subsequent scene of the flight from burning Atlanta are very impressive and emotional scenes. Lastly, the costumes, and in particular Scarlett's dresses (including the impromptu one from her velvet curtains that she makes to try to seduce an imprisoned Rhett to pay for increased taxes at Tara) are extraordinary.

579,Nilesh Kashyap,The Hunger Games ,"Mar 26, 2012",2,"My ‚ÄòThe Hunger Games‚Äô week

23rd march- movie is released
24th march- I read this review and end up watching excellent trailers, Later I downloaded the excerpt and kind of liked the first chapter
25th march- I am a proud owner of the book. Yay!
26th to 27th march- I started reading the book
This is how I thought it would go:
Once I would start reading it, I would just be sucked into it and finish the book remaining awake until early hours of morning, with my bloodshot red eyes.
This is how it went:
I started it and was immediately sucked into the book but then around midway I started losing interest. I fell asleep and had horrible dream (credit to graphic violence). Next morning I finished it owning to its fast pace.

This book is special:

This is my first dystopian novel. I was very much excited about it since it was my introduction to a new genre. I would like to thank this book for such amazing description of dystopian world.


The book:

This is a kind of book which probably everyone has read including their dogs, cats and birds too!
So there is no need to hide the spoilers but as warning-
**SPOILERS AHEAD**
This book started brilliantly and within few pages sucked me into it. The world building part is brilliant. Introduction to districts, new society, people‚Äôs life, the rules, the reaping, and yes ‚ÄòThe hunger Games‚Äô. It is fast paced with simplistic writing. These are all good things. The best part kids are starting to read the books.
But that‚Äôs where the good things end.
Suzanne Collins created the opportunity (golden ones) and one by one she destroyed it. But still most of the people are enthralled by the book as it eventually came out. But I‚Äôm not.
So I‚Äôm going to tell very explicitly what I didn‚Äôt like...


Using the first person perspective and thus losing the chance to give depth to any character

This story has been told through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, she just doesn't give a damn about anyone else except her family so naturally the other characters are too shallow and one dimensional.
Many people just love Peeta and Katniss but I don‚Äôt like either of them. All I knew about Peeta was that he liked Katniss from age of five, saved her twice and is now in love with Katniss, rest is mystery.
About Katniss, she does a lot of thing (infact she does everything in the book) but never has a second thought about them, never reflect over what she has done, eventually no attachment with the character.
People tend to like Rue, Peeta, Cinna because these are few characters that spent time with Katniss, but (again)no character has depth.
One more outcome that I feel from other reviews is that Katniss is definitely heroine of the story but why make other 10 kids villain. While Cato and Clove make their kill they become monster but when Katniss makes her kill, it has to be justified as revenge for killing Rue and pity killing of Cato.
This book is all about KATNISS, KATNISS and KATNISS...


Very predictable plot

The plot is so much predictable that I was surprised after every 10 or 20 pages (I‚Äôm not out of my mind) because the story would turn out exactly how I would guess. First I thought that maybe my mind is highly synchronised with Collins‚Äôs mind but later on reading other reviews it turned out the plot was predictable.


Missed opportunities

This could have been much more interesting novel. Where did it all go wrong? As I‚Äôm writing, everything wrong in story to me looks like is outcome of first person perspective.
--I would have felt much more connected to the games had it contained a bit of background information of every important tributes. Despite the killings being graphical, I didn‚Äôt felt sad for their deaths.
--When Katniss makes her first kill, she moves over to do other things (because Rue is dying). But later when she realises that it was her first kill, still she doesn‚Äôt reflect over it even for a minute. Killing other human has effect on the killer, until and unless killer is sociopath, moreover here the killers are kids. Instead of giving insight to their mind the story flatly moves ahead with killing and ending the games.


It doesn‚Äôt make me think

I read books because I enjoy it and because they push my mind to a new level of thinking which benefit me. This book made me think only about, why I didn‚Äôt like this book when whole world is enjoying this. No further thoughts beyond that.

Maciek‚Äôs thought on this book:

‚ÄúThe Hunger Games reads like a bag of chips, meaning you can devour it in several short bites but it will leave you unnourished and aside from gas, it won‚Äôt have much effect.‚Äù

FOR ALL THIS 2 STARS(**)
In many reviews people come out with most lame excuse (defense) I have ever heard- IT‚Äôs A YOUNG-ADULT NOVEL
As for other books in the series, I will definitely read them but I‚Äôm not in hurry or excited with this prospect. I will read it someday, probably before second installment of the movie.

To put a perfect end to ‚ÄòThe Hunger Games‚Äô week
28th march- I watched the movie
Movie turned out pretty good, much better than I had anticipated. As I watched the movie it seemed that novel was written with movie in mind. Few minor changes, like in the end President Snow shown thinking representing its start of story unlike novel which ends. Some scenes are breath taking, too much violence. Acting by Jennifer Lawrence is good (she turned out better than Katniss in the book). I liked the movie, rated it 7/10.

This review is inspired by Maciek‚Äôs review and Brian‚Äôs review.
P.S. The kind of reviews and comments I have seen makes me think this book is being followed like religion and my review will sound like blasphemy to them. But I can‚Äôt help it, I tried to be honest."

581,Sophie Crane,The Complete Chronicles of Narnia,"Jun 29, 2017",5,"The Chronicles of Narnia are 7 wonderful adventures experienced on two or three levels: children's adventure stories, adults' and children's adventures in the Christian life and their spiritual being, and an adventure into the future of planet Earth. Perfect for reading aloud to children from 8 upwards they're moving and inspiring for adults as well. There's humour, knotty problems we all face and positive ways to face them, a new and lovely way of perceiving and respecting animals and the environment, knightly battles and daily battles, and an open acceptance of the different and the little. These books retain their excitement and inspiration after many readings, especially because the more one reads them, the more one sees in them and can apply to one's life and aspirations. There is the battle between Good and Evil throughout and the most helpful, natural and comforting confrontation of weakness, failure, struggle, mutual responsibility. Evil and death are faced and gone through positively. Different beliefs are respected. Sound theology is well grounded in reality. An inspired man wrote these books."
582,Sean Barrs,Of Mice and Men,"Feb 26, 2014",5,"I remember reading this at school at being completely uninterested in the story. I remember the teacher droning on about basic plot allegories before we read each section; she would tell us what certain things ‚Äúmeant‚Äù before we had even seen them. She would explain how this portrays a vital part of American culture and a vital element of human nature. All in all we were told what to see in the book before we even began reading. 

Perhaps she should have just let us read it first, and see what we took from it before being told how to read it. I hated it at the time. I hated being told that passages meant certain things when clearly criticism is just speculation. This wasn‚Äôt effective teaching: it was being told how to think. She should have prized open our minds and made us engage with it more. When I approached it again years later I did so with more of an open mind, I was determined to find more in the book than I‚Äôd been taught to see. 

And I did. Lenny and George naively dream of the farm; they dream of a retreat where they can reside in friendship without having to answer to any master. They wouldn‚Äôt have to go to work; they can simply work for themselves. Running their own farm would mean that they are self-sustainable. They could grow crops for themselves and choose when they laboured: they would be free. Well George wants this. Lenny just wants a few rabbits to pet. The attractiveness of the dream draws in Candy, who is very old and very lonely. He doesn‚Äôt want to end up like his dog: put down because of his years. He wants someone to protect him and care for him in his advanced years. The three become united by this shared dream but it is nothing but fancy. 

‚ÄúJust like heaven. Ever‚Äôbody wants a little piece of lan‚Äô. I read plenty of books out here. Nobody never gets to heaven, and nobody gets no land. It‚Äôs just in their head. They‚Äôre all the time talkin‚Äô about it, but it‚Äôs jus‚Äô in their head.‚Äù



Indeed, the American dream doesn‚Äôt exist in this book. Only harsh cold reality awaits the protagonists. Crooks, for all his cruel and understandable bitterness, was right in the end. The farm is just a dream. It is evocative of the loneliness within the human soul, and how we will always long for the impossible. It‚Äôs impossible because there is no sunset over the rainbow. Life doesn‚Äôt quite work like that. People don‚Äôt always get what they want. The world is a cruel unforgiving place here. This is embodied by Lenny; he is vulnerable and emotionally weak. He is completely unaware of the vicious strength he possesses. He never truly understands the situation. He almost walks through the world blind. The world he sees is different to that of everyone else‚Äôs. 

So this is a story about the outsiders, about the unloved and misunderstood. This a story about those that long for an alternative to the drudgery of standard human existence, but have their expectations cut short. This is a story about how we judge people based upon their appearance and how we label them unjustly. This is a story that Mary Shelley would have loved, a story where a character with an innocent heart is destroyed by the world he should have been accepted by.

583,Federico DN,1984,"Feb 24, 2014",4,"""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.""  

In ravaged post-apocalyptic future, the world has divided itself into three totalitarian superpowers: Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. The three superstates always in constant never ending war with each other, and relentlessly and mercilessly purging their own population to align them with their current goals. Winston works in the ‚ÄòMinistry of Truth‚Äô every day revising, rewriting and burning history records to match the ever changing version of history dictated by their all-powerful leader, the Big Brother. Secretly though, deep in his heart Winston hates their cruel leadership, and wishes their defeat. A traitor in thought, his life would be forfeit if someone ever finds out, and there are spies everywhere‚Ä¶

An unforgettable story about the inner strength and inherent weakness of the human spirit, struggling in the most oppressive of worlds. A book that teaches us to love and value freedom, and its costs; to cherish independent thought, and never letting go the fight. I LOVED the secret unfolding relationship with Julia, their quirkiness (view spoiler)[and even their doomed fate (hide spoiler)]; and I can‚Äôt express my heartbreak and sadness for the ultimate fate of the ever cheerful and loyal Tom Parsons. Gosh! This was a such a dark and grim story, but overall, enormously invaluable. 

A timeless masterpiece and one of the founding pillars of dystopian fiction. A must read in life, along with Fahrenheit 451 and  Brave New World . The holy trinity of dystopia. Highly Recommendable!

After a decade or so my memory is a bit hazy but I think I found the ‚ÄòGoldstein book‚Äô part quite tedious; hence the four stars. Everything else was just perfect, darkly perfect. I remember enjoying this one immensely back in the day. ‚ÄòAnimal farm‚Äô as well, another absolute masterpiece. Boy I really need to read more Orwell one of these days!

*** The movie Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) is a fantastic adaptation, greatly capturing much of the book‚Äôs essence. Some liberties were taken of course, but overall pretty faithful to the original work. Coincidentally it was filmed in 1984! Can you believe it? Talk about brilliant perfect timing! John Hurt was spectacular, in one of his most iconic and remembered performances ever. May the good man rest in peace. Suzanna Hamilton was magnificent too; and Gregor Fisher as Parsons was totally on point., and boy did I hate O‚ÄôBrien! Fortunately much of the book of Goldstein tediousness was omitted. Not a perfect film mind you, but a great adaptation. An absolute must watch, even if you didn‚Äôt read the book.

 ‚ÄúLa guerra es la paz. La libertad es la esclavitud. La ignorancia es la fuerza‚Äù  

En un devastado futuro post-apocal√≠ptico, el mundo se ha dividido a s√≠ mismo en tres superpoderes totalitarios: Ocean√≠a, Eurasia y Asia Oriental. Los tres superestados siempre uno contra otro en una constante guerra sin fin, y purgando sin descanso y sin piedad su propia poblaci√≥n para alinearlos con sus objetivos actuales. Winston trabaja en el ‚ÄòMinisterio de la Verdad‚Äô todos los d√≠as revisando, reescribiendo y quemando registros de historia para que se adecuen a la siempre cambiante versi√≥n de la historia dictada por su todopoderoso l√≠der, el Gran Hermano. Aunque secretamente, en lo profundo de su coraz√≥n Winston odia su cruel liderazgo, y desea su derrota. Un traidor en pensamiento, su vida estar√≠a perdida si alguien llegara a enterarse, y hay esp√≠as por doquier‚Ä¶

Una inolvidable historia sobre la fuerza interna e inherente debilidad del esp√≠ritu humano, luchando en el m√°s opresivo de los mundos. Un libro que nos ense√±a a amar y valorar la libertad, y sus costos; apreciar el pensamiento independiente, y nunca abandonar la lucha. AME el secreto desarrollo de la relaci√≥n con Julia, su excentricidad (view spoiler)[ e incluso su fat√≠dico destino (hide spoiler)]; y no puedo ni expresar mi desconsuelo y tristeza por el fin √∫ltimo del fiel y siempre positivo Tom Parsons. ¬°Dios! Esta s√≠ que fue una historia oscura y sombr√≠a, pero por sobre todo, enormemente invaluable.

Una obra maestra de todos los tiempos y uno de los pilares fundacionales de la ficci√≥n dist√≥pica. Una lectura obligada de la vida, junto a Fahrenheit 451 y  Un Mundo Feliz . La santa trinidad de la distop√≠a. ¬°Altamente Recomendable!

Despu√©s de una d√©cada o m√°s mi memoria es algo nubosa pero creo que la parte del ‚ÄòLibro de Goldstein‚Äô fue bastante tediosa; por eso las cuatro estrellas. Todo lo dem√°s fue simplemente perfecto, oscuramente perfecto. Recuerdo haber disfrutado inmensamente este libro en su d√≠a. ‚ÄòRebeli√≥n en la granja‚Äô tambi√©n, otra gigante obra maestra. ¬°Creo que necesito leer m√°s de Orwell uno de estos d√≠as!

*** La pel√≠cula (1984) es una fant√°stica adaptaci√≥n, capturando enormemente mucha de la esencia del libro. Algunas libertades se tomaron por supuesto, pero dentro de todo bastante fiel a la obra original. ¬°Coincidentemente fue filmada en 1984! ¬øIncre√≠ble no? ¬°Brillante y perfecta sincronizaci√≥n! John Hurt estuvo espectacular, en una de sus m√°s ic√≥nicas y recordadas actuaciones jam√°s. Que el buen hombre descanse en paz. Suzanna Hamilton estuvo magn√≠fica tambi√©n; y Gregor Fisher como Parsons totalmente acorde, ¬°y por Dios c√≥mo odi√© a O‚ÄôBrien! Afortunadamente mucho del tedioso libro de Goldstein fue omitido. No un filme perfecto debo aclarar, pero s√≠ una genial adaptaci√≥n. Un absoluto deber de ver en la vida, incluso si no le√≠ste el libro.

This concludes my re-read of Order of the Phoenix! Thanks for riding along with me!"
585,Debbie W.,The Outsiders,"Feb 19, 2023",3,"Why I chose to read this book:
1. I have heard about this book over the years and wanted to see why it was required reading in some schools; and,
2. February 2023 is my ""Books For Young and Old Alike"" Month.

Praise:
The characterization is quite complex in this story. Even though the Greasers come from ""the wrong side of the tracks"", they each have their strengths and their weaknesses. Some question their choices in life. Even some of the rich ""Socs"" are shown in a humane light.

Niggle:
The plot really fell short for me. Events happened quickly and either ended too conveniently or too abruptly. Some scenarios were head-scratching unbelievable and, at times, emotionless.

Overall Thoughts:
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that author S. E. Hinton wrote the majority of this story when she was only 16-years-old! She obviously followed the ""golden rule of writing"" - write what you know and care about.
Research shows that children crave structure - they need the adults in their lives to ""parent"" them, not to be their buddies. So as a parent and a teacher myself, I loved the quote when Randy was talking to Ponyboy about his dead friend, Bob's, very lax upbringing:
""That is what he wanted. For somebody to tell him 'No'. To have somebody lay down the law, set the limits, give him something solid to stand on. That's what we all want, really.""

Recommendation?
A quick, thoughtful read. Give it a try, if you haven't already."

It's long."
587,Ela,The Lightning Thief ,"Jun 19, 2011",5,"I'm slightly ashamed to say that I watched the movie before I read the book. But I'm even more ashamed that I watched the movie only to experience the hotness that is Logan Lerman.



But, come on! Someone tell me that  this , is not hot:



Really. What did I tell you? (I do imagine that you probably won't read the rest of the review anf just stare at this gif instead, but that's no reason not to like my review! :D)

But, I really have to thank Logan. I really do. Because without his unfreakingbelieveable hotness, I wouldn't have watched the movie, and I would've never read the awesomeness of The Lightning Thief. 

Yes, I loved the book. I've always taken an interest in Greek Mythology and I thought Rick Riordan's take on it was very unique, and unlike anything I've read before. 

I absolutely loved Camp- Halfblood. Well, it sure seemed better than the budget summer camps I've been to. RR seriously out did himself with writing the camp. I could imagine everything vividly and I like to think that I know the camp from back to front. The cabins would have to be my favourite feature of the camp, though. If only they were like that in the camps I've been to. 



Percy. What can I say? The guy has amazing underwater powers, is kick- ass and is a demigod. He's super loyal to his friends and family, is brave and has the looks (this is the part when you look at the gif of Logan Lerman again ;D). And he can make me laugh. Come on. You have to give a guy who make you laugh some credit. In short, the guy's the full package. 

Another thing I loved were the other characters. Especially Annabeth, who looks like Cinderella in Percy's words (am I right? I don't have the book on me, sorry. Stupid library fines). And I'm expecting something to develop between her and Percy, if you know what I mean....



So, yeah. I loved the book, it was exciting, fast- paced and humorous. Just one thing though, I'm kind of pissed that they didn't have cabins in the movie. Or Clarisse. Or the Oracle. Though it's hardly RR's fault. I just had to get it out there."
588,Andy Marr,Gone with the Wind,"Jun 16, 2021",1,"God's nightie! A thousand-page love letter to slavery! 

I did not like it."
589,Emily May,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Aug 15, 2012",5,"""The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.""


And so begins this tale of art and sin. 

I would highly recommend first watching the movie Wilde, a film which takes the audience on a journey through the life of the tormented writer, from the beginnings of his fame to his later incarceration for ""gross indecency"" - a charge used to imprison individuals when it was impossible to prove sodomy. Wilde was sentenced to two years hard labour and died not long after being freed due to health problems gained during those two years. Looking at Wilde's story from a twenty-first century perspective, it is sad and horrifying to realise this man was indirectly sentenced to death for being gay. The ""hard labour"" prescribed was carried out in various ways but one of the most common was the treadmill:



This machine made prisoners walk continuously uphill for hours on end and had many long-term effects on people's health.

Why do I think it's important to know this? Because, as Wilde claims, in every piece of art there is more of the artist than anything else. And I believe this is especially true of The Picture of Dorian Gray more than perhaps any other fictional work I've read. In this novel, Wilde explores the nature of sin, of morality and immorality. The homoerotic undertones between Dorian Gray, Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton are, I think, the author's little expression of his own secret ""sins"" within his work. Rarely does a work of fiction so deeply seem to mirror elements of the author's life.

By 1891, when The Picture of Dorian Gray was published, Oscar Wilde had met and fallen in love with Lord Alfred Douglas and they had begun a semi-secret affair. By which I mean that many were suspicious of the relationship but didn't argue with Wilde's claims that they shared a Socrates/Plato teacher/student kind of love. The idolisation of Dorian Gray's youth and beauty, his tendency to be mean at random... these characteristics all fit with the description and personality of Lord Alfred Douglas. For me, there is no real question as to whether part of Dorian is meant to be Mr Wilde's lover.

I think if you familiarise yourself with Oscar Wilde, this becomes a very personal novel, much more than just a disturbing horror story where a man sells his soul. But even without any additional information, I think this is a sad and haunting book that tells of the joyful naivete of youth and the sad wisdom of maturity.

590,LooseLips,The Great Gatsby,"Dec 31, 2007",3,"The eh Gatsby

Classic. Yes. THE great American novel. Hmph, so I heard. I suppose it should make one more interested, or at least feel more compelled to read something (or re-read as is the case here) when it has ""classic"" and ""everyone else loves it!"" stamped all over it. And has a movie made out of it, though what beloved novel hasn't these days? Of course, I originally read FSF's Gatsby because I was expected to for a high school English class. So, even though I was never the type to do homework, I read The Great Gatsby because it had a neat cover, Fitzgerald is fun to say, and, of course, the legend of Zelda. 

Unfortunately for Meredyth, my thoughts on Gatsby 10 years ago are pretty similar to the thoughts I have on it today: How pretty. Pretty decedant. How drippy. How zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. 

It's not that I was completely uninterested. It's that my interest was never piqued to the point of really giving a shit. Sure, who doesn't love a hot mysteriously wealthy man with serious heart ache for a serious material girl? What about those rich dudes who may be crooks but no one can figger out how crooked they are exactly because how crooked can you be if you throw such mean hoedowns?! 

Oh, and I love a good morally ambiguous-protaganist/narrator-who-hates-parties-and-society-but-just-can't-seem-to-stay-away as much as the next person, but Nick, our hero, just wants to be liked so very much, and unfortunately, he reads like a sap. And when all the other characters are unforgivable bores, I would prefer that my ambiguous, socially mandated narrator manage to keep me awake. 

What about those three stars? You ask. Well I can't lie. I do think Fitz had a way with words. I did find that those subtle nuances of the variations in lifestyle during the depression to be very much in effect, and I would be happy to visit any fictional small town called West Egg. Or East Egg for that matter. And I get the kind of crazy he was going for in his more psychopathic character, George Wilson, who, because he was in love, becomes the bastiOn of normalcy even when he is driven to murder and his own suicide. 

FSF did manage to be believably compassionate towards his seemingly less insane characters, (who are all on the brink of insanity) (but still made me drowsy). There is definitely a part of me that sees how one could be drawn into the twinkly lit world FSF created, supposedly, out of his own reality, and I have noted his passion for the beauty of the unfolding story, such as it is. 

But I was disappointed 10 years ago by the story's inability to convince me it wasn't nap time, its unwillingness to point out the the relevance of the individual over society, and the irrelevance of the world Gatsby inhabits, and I was disappointed again this past week. 

In summation, be sure to keep an eye out for this writer. Once he writes something more appealing to the masses he's sure to bust out onto the scene soon. You heard it here first."

The Alchemist ~~ Paulo Coelho


I preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate The Alchemist. I‚Äôm one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work. Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book.



The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.



The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.



As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate.

 

Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their ‚ÄúPersonal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: ‚ÄúI am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life.

 

The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting."

Jokes aside, The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is an endlessly quotable book. It reads like a fable, with very catchy and accessible writing that is meant to empower and make you feel good. This really works for a lot of people‚ÄîI mean this was a widely successful novel‚Äîand I‚Äôm happy that so many people could be moved and inspired by a book. Especially a book that unites people around the world by being an international success. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it all comes across as a pristine facade without much behind it, offering something that can be quickly digested but isn‚Äôt actually filling. This is a book that I recall enjoying enough when I read it as a teen but haven‚Äôt thought of since, so when someone picked it as our next read for our book club I was excited to revisit it seeing as I remembered literally nothing about it. I hate to say it, but being fun but forgettable is my takeaway from it again.

‚ÄòThere is only one way to learn... It's through action.‚Äô

Coelho said the book was written very quickly because ‚Äòthe book was already written in my soul,‚Äô and in the forward he discusses how this novel was his own Personal Legend. ‚ÄòI was living my own metaphor,‚Äô he said, being thrilled just to get it picked up by a Brazilian publisher who, in 1988, only ran 900 copies assuming it would not be a big success. The book ended up taking off, with the 1993 English translation becoming a massive hit and lead to numerous further translations. Coelho even holds a Guinness World Record for ‚Äúmost translations of a single title signed by the author in 1 sitting‚Äù, signing his book in 53 different translated editions at a book event in Germany. So I can really appreciate that aspect, and his own personal journey into publishing and believing in himself is honestly better than the book itself. 



Fun fact: The Alchemist had a big boost in sales when then-President Bill Clinton was photographed reading it.

For those who don‚Äôt know, the story follows a young boy, Santiago, as he journeys across the desert and meets a lot of interesting people along the way. Literally every person has a pearl of positive wisdom to share it seems, and it becomes a rapid fire of empowerment quotes that could all go on one of those inspirational posters made for office walls in the 90s. Actually, I‚Äôm fairly certain I‚Äôve seen one that quoted this book. The characters all feel like a mouthpiece for Coehlo to pass along his positive message, or wisdom, and one can easily imagine this being a self-help book had he not decided to attach a fictional narrative to it. It is a nice message, that you have to believe in yourself and in your goals and, if you truly do (‚Äúonly those who are true of heart‚Äù vibes like in fairy tales) the universe will conspire to help you achieve your goal. Which is a nice inspirational message and sometimes that is what you need to hear to break free from self doubt. Particularly as another primary message is that we must overcome fear to accomplish what we need to do. ‚ÄòDon't give in to your fears,‚Äô Coelho writes, ‚ÄòIf you do, you won't be able to talk to your heart.‚Äô So great, yea, believe in yourself. I dig that.

‚ÄòTo realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation.‚Äô

I do, however, see it as a bit of a back-patting perspective. Like yes, if you are successful it is nice to feel like it is because you are pure of heart. He tells us that those who don‚Äôt follow their dreams end up in ruin and sadness. This is sort of a success fallacy in a way, as it implies that if things are bad its because you just didn‚Äôt try hard enough. Which‚Ä¶ehhhhh‚Ä¶I mean there are a lot of forces acting in society that gatekeep and sometimes it‚Äôs more than just not overcoming adversity. And I get it, keep trying, yea, but it feels a bit like shaming? Which is honestly overthinking it though as this book is not that nuanced or deep (something I kept saying during debates over minor details during book club: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he even considered that and its beside the point because it‚Äôs not actually that deep‚Äù). It is meant to be a fun and empowering story that paints in broad strokes and yea, I get why it means a lot to many people. For me it just seemed a bit flat and like a snack when I wanted a meal.

‚ÄòEveryone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.‚Äô 
Okay, fine, I don‚Äôt know how to write a good book or how to live my life either, but I just know this one wasn‚Äôt it for me.


I did appreciate how it was aimed at a general positive idea of spirituality that, while using different religions, was not necessarily religious. Spiritual, or mystic would seem the better term. I liked the idea of the universe, the sand, the wind, etc as conscious entities that can collaborate with you. While I really disliked the deus ex machina ending, the whole idea of the world as a spiritual presence was well done. Coelho does sort of pull an orientalism in his depiction as an outsider of the region as this wild and savage land full of wise sages and cutthroat robbers, but it does seem with the aim of capturing the feel of One Thousand and One Nights or other tales of adventure and ‚Äòfinding yourself‚Äô in exotic locale. Which I think is a topic that people have had a more nuanced discussion on since this book was written.

‚ÄòIt's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting,‚Äô Coelho writes, and this I can agree with. However, in The Alchemist, the general tone of the book is that dreams seem a thing only for men. Fatima, Santiago‚Äôs love interest, lacks much agency in the tale and is more or less written as a prize for following his Personal Legend. She is an element of his journey, while I guess he is all her journey gets to be. He tells her ‚ÄòI love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you,‚Äô which‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt all that romantic or great? Hey, the universe popped you into my life, guess you‚Äôll do for a bride. C‚Äômon, man, does she have any personality or intelligence you enjoy and don‚Äôt just tell me how beautiful she is. Didn‚Äôt vibe with any of that aspect of the book.

I also didn‚Äôt really like the ending. Sure it is riffing on the whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs the journey not the destination‚Äù aspect but it felt a bit flat for me with the deus ex machina moment. It is a happy ending though, and one full of success and rewards. As a bookclub member pointed out, it sort of resonates with a quote by T.S. Eliot: ‚ÄòWe shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.‚Äô

So in the end, I‚Äôm mostly ambivalent to this book. I see why people enjoy it and it is admittedly pretty and sweet and uplifting. It‚Äôs a good vibe to be in. It didn‚Äôt do much for me, but that‚Äôs alright too.

593,Colleen,The Book Thief,"Aug 18, 2007",5,"I put off reading this book for the library book club. Here are my three reasons for doing so:

1) It's a Young Adult Book. I am an Adult. It can't be that good if it's written for young people.
2) It's about the Holocaust, and I think we've all heard enough about that. The author will probably even focus on colors among the grays, as in ""Schindler's List.""
3) I have WAY too many other books to read.

After avoiding the book for as long as possible, I sat down, hoping to enjoy it enough to gain some clever comments for the book group.

Turns out, most of my concerns were right. But one other thing was also true: THIS BOOK ROCKS.

The first thing any review will say about this book is that it is narrated by death. So, I might as well get it out of the way. Death, the Hooded One, the Angel of the Night, narrates. He is very busy during the war years, as you might expect. Some people claim this is a mere gimmick, and that the story is strong enough as it is. 

I agree that this is a strong story-- it moves like a sailboat on a brisk day-- but I think the choice to tell it through Death was a good one. Death foreshadows constantly, so we know a bit about which of the characters will die. Instead of ruining the shock value, this heightened my anticipation and dread. And isn't that how people feel during war? They know some of them are bound to die. They know they will lose loved ones. It's one long, hellish wait to see how it will turn out. 

It's also an unusual take on the Holocaust because it focuses on Liesel, an orphaned German girl living in Hitler's birthplace. Liesel (The Book Thief) and the other characters in this book are rich, interesting, and wily. I say wily because at points in the book you hate them, but they change, and you grow to love them. For instance, Liesel's adopted mother is a foul-mouthed, abusive, sharp woman. (SPOILER--->) When Liesel's adopted father is shipped off to war, however, Liesel creeps through the house to see Rosa sleeping with her husband's accordian strapped around her waist. Rosa's changes prove one of the greatest reasons to read good literature-- to get insight into the type of people we don't usually give a second chance."

Arthur Dent is having a bad day, his house is about to be levelled down because it‚Äôs in the way of the construction of a new freeway. At the local pub, he encounters his enigmatic friend Ford Prefect. Prefect, a galactic hitchhiker, is leaving the Earth, and taking Dent with him. A minor nuisance; apparently the Earth is just about to be demolished to make way for an interstellar freeway. Dent‚Äôs realization is instant, several billions of people are going to have a very bad day. 

This is the most ridiculously funny book I‚Äôve ever read. Although that may be because it was my very first of the kind. I think the hype is very well deserved, if you are into that kind of humor. I lost track of how many times it made me laugh, and I‚Äôm not really an easy person to make laugh. Outrageously silly sci-fi humor in every single chapter. An unforgettable ride through an absurdity of worlds scattered along the vast craziness of an unfathomable galaxy.

The movie (2005) is a mediocre adaptation at best; even with a stellar cast like Rockwell, Deschanel and Malkovich. It‚Äôs not nearly as funny as the book, not by a long shot, at least for me. It doesn‚Äôt make it justice and is not exactly faithful to the original work. And sadly, you just can‚Äôt bring down the magnificently complex absurdity of Douglas writing to cinematic dialog without losing much of its original magic.

-----------------------------------------------"
596,Sean Barrs,Jane Eyre,"Feb 26, 2014",5,"Reader, I gave it five stars. Please let me tell you why. 

Jane Eyre is the quintessential Victorian novel. It literally has everything that was typical of the period, but, unlike other novels, it has all the elements in one story. At the centre is the romance between Jane and Rochester, which is enhanced by gothic elements such as the uncanniness of the doppleganger and the spectre like qualities of Bertha. In addition, it is also a governess novel; these were an incredibly popular type of storytelling in the age and for it to be combined with gothic elements, which are interposed with a dualistic relationship between realism and romance, is really quite unique. The correct term for this is a hybrid, in which no genre voice is dominant; they exist alongside each other creating one rather special book. 

And this is so, so, special; it‚Äôs an excellent piece of literature. Jane‚Äôs journey is gut wrenching and emotional. Through her life she experiences real sorrow, the kind that would make a lesser person give up. She also experiences real friendship, the type that comes across perhaps once in a lifetime. But, most significantly, she experiences true love and the development of independence to form he own ending. I really do love this book. Bronte utilises the first person narrative, which creates a high degree of intimacy with her character; it makes me feel like I know Jane as well as she comes to know her own self. 

‚ÄúI am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.‚Äù

 

Jane‚Äôs a strong willed individual. From a very young age she had the clarity of intelligence to recognise the injustice that was her life; yes, she is narrating her story retrospectively, though she still had the perceptiveness to realise how mistreated she was. I love the pathetic fallacy Bronte uses at the beginning. The child Jane looks out the window, shielded by the curtain, and witnesses the horrible weather. It is cold and bleak; it is windy and morose; thus, we can immediately see the internal workings of Jane‚Äôs mind. The weather reflects her feelings throughout the novel, and at the very beginning the situation was at its worse. This can also be seen with the fire imagery that represents her rage when she is shoved in the red room; it later mirrors that of Bertha‚Äôs fury.

 Everybody needs love, children especially so. These early experiences help to define her later character, and, ultimately influence how she sees the world; she still hides behind a curtain in Rochester‚Äôs house when he flirts with Miss Ingrum. These experiences set her on an almost perpetual quest for love, for belonging and for the independence to make her own decisions. She finds friendship in the form of Helen Burns; she gives her some sound advice, but Jane cannot fully accept such religious fatalism. However, it does inspire her, a little, to continue with life; she realises, no matter what happens, she will always have the love of her greatest friend. Jane clings to this idea, but, ultimately, has to seek a more permanent solution to her loneliness. She needs a vocation, one that will fulfil her and give her life meaning; thus, she becomes a governess and crosses paths with the downtrodden, miserable wretch that is Mr Rochester. 

 

Sometimes I feel like Rochester didn‚Äôt know quite what he wanted. When he sees Jane he sees a woman with strength, blunt honesty and integrity: he sees an emotional equal. This attracts her to him, which develops into love. However, when he tries to express his love he does it through trying to claim her as his own. Through doing so, not only does he show the nature of Victorian marriage, he shows his own deep vulnerability. He loves her mind, her intelligence, and he too wants to be loved. He longs for it with a frightening passion. So, instead of doing things the way Jane would have wanted him to do, he overwhelms her with expensive affection. By doing so he almost loses her. All Jane wanted was his heart, nothing more nothing less. 

By showering her with such flattery and expensive items, he insults her independence. He risks destroying the thing that attracted him to her in the first place, their equality; their mutual respect and love. He takes away her dignity. I really don‚Äôt think the original marriage would have worked. Ignore the existence of the mad woman in the attic; I just think Rochester would have spoilt it. It would have become too awkward. They needed to be on the same societal level as well as one of intellect and character. The ending is touching and a little sad, but it is the only one that could ever have worked for these two characters. Without the tragedy there could never have be rejuvenation and the chance for them to be together on equal terms, no matter what it cost to get there. 





If that wasn‚Äôt enough reason for me to love this book, there are also elements of fantasy and desire. This is a realism novel, it pertains to credible events, but the suggestions of fantasy only add to the strong romantic notions. Rochester is enamoured by Jane; he cannot believe that a woman like her actually exists. All his misguided notions are brushed away in an instant. Whilst he views Jane as special, it is clear that he realises that other women may also have a similar rebellious voice, only hidden. He considers her an elf, a witch, an improbable woman that has captured his desire, his heart, his soul, his life. He knows he will never be the same again. From Jane‚Äôs point of view, her first encounter with him is otherworldly. She had grown bored with her governess role, and when she sees the approach of Rochester and his dog Pilot, she sees the gytrash myth; she wants to see something fantastical instead she finds her heart, which is something much rarer. 

Then there are also the feminist elements. Jane transgresses the boundary associated with her gender in the Victorian age. For a woman to be recognised as having equal intellect to that of a man was sadly a rare thing. Women could actually attend university, but the downside was they could never get the full degree. They could spend months studying, though never be recognised as actually having gained the qualification. It was just another attempt to keep women under the thumb, so for Bronte to portray the truth of Jane‚Äôs equal intellect is a great step for the recognition of women, and women writers. This book received a whole host of negative reviews at the time of its publication for this element alone. Stupid really, but that‚Äôs misogyny for you. 

Reader, I love this book. I really could go on, but this is getting kind of long. I hope I‚Äôve made it clear why I love this story so much. I shall be reading this again later this year to correspond with my exams, which I‚Äôm already looking forward to- the reading that is, not the exams. I don‚Äôt think will ever have read this story enough though.

           I looked up Harper Lee online this is her only published book. However, she did write a few articles that one can find and read online:
Love in other Words - Vogue
Christmas to me - McCalls
When Children Discover America
Romance and High Adventure

Her full name is Nellie Harper Lee - I bet she dropped the Nellie part so publishers would mistakenly think she was a man and read her material. She is also still alive and living in Monroeville, Alabama. And once you read about her and her family, you will know that she is not the only amazing person in that family (guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree).

I was able to tell in the beginning that the book started in the 30's once Dill mentioned that he saw Dracula in the theaters. Dracula was in theaters in 1931-32 (don't ask how I know that), and they mentioned that they were in the Depression which started in 1929 (1927-28 for the farmers) and went on through out the 30's. Since they were openly drinking, Prohibition must have ended (1933). And, towards the end of the book, they were mentioning Hitler and what he was doing in Germany which took place in the late 30's. My history teachers would be so impressed that I retained all of that information. Too bad my head is so full of that information, I have to look up my own phone number.

I loved Scout. In fact, I get dibs on that name for a little girl- or did Bruce Willis and Demi Moore beat me to it? I loved that she wanted to be a person first and then a girl. And she supports the fact that little kids know the meaning of life and forget it as they get older. She had a great relationship with her brother and father and they encouraged her to be true to herself and not follow the stereotypes of ladies of that time. I loved her way of thinking especially how she drew the conclusion that if she starting swearing her dad would assume she picked up the bad habits from school and pull her out. And when she wanted to write a letter to Dill in invisible ink just to drive him crazy, I almost ruined the book because I was drinking a Diet Pepsi at the time.

I have a feeling that Harper Lee was just like Scout and have you noticed that all early 1900 female authors are tomboys? Louisa Mae Alcott was Jo in Little Women, Laura Wilder wrote about herself. It just goes to show you that the truly creative women were those that went against the stereotypes of the time.

I'm not sure I like the fact that Atticus allowed them to call him by his first name and not Dad, but aside from that he was the perfect role model. He talked to them, not at them, and he always listened. He firmly believed that it was important for his children to respect him and by NOT following the creed ""Do as I say, not as I do"", Scout and Jem would be able to look up to him. He wanted his children to look beyond the color of one's skin, therefore he did. He treated everyone as equal despite their race, family background, age or education and if more people did that, there wouldn't be as many problems today. His teaching methods worked. You can tell how much the children loved and looked up to him. Nothing hurt them more then having their father be ashamed of them. They didn't keep things from him because they thought he wouldn't understand. They kept things from him because they didn't want him to get hurt. And they always listened, because to disobey would hurt Atticus.

Atticus's brother was another one of my favorite characters even though he wasn't mentioned a lot. When he realized his error after punishing Scout for beating up her cousin and tried to make it right, it showed that he also strived to earn their respect just like Atticus. Nothing irates me more then when someone tells me I have to respect them because they are older than me. Whatever. Does that mean I have to respect Bob Ewall because he is older?

It's easy to see with all of the problems in the world why Boo Radley feels safer hiding from away from it. It takes a special person to admit defeat to the clich√© ""if you can't beat them join them"" and turn his back on things he doesn't understand. I think everyone has a little bit of Boo in us, when we shut out the problems of the outside. Of course, we all have a little of Scout in us to especially when I come out fighting if anyone tries to hurt my family.

The court case. Wow, the sad thing is, is I can see that happening even today (i.e. the Rodney King trial). When I moved here the first time, just before the LA riots, there was a huge ordeal about a Korean, store-owner who shot and killed a 17-19 black, teenager girl, she claimed was stealing and attacking her. The security camera shows the tiff and it shows the teen putting down the item and walking towards the exit. The store owner shot her in the back and was found not-guilty, by reason of self-defense. When the book was published in 1960, discrimination was still a big problem. I did like how Harper Lee brought up Hitler's actions against the Jews. It was obvious that what was going on in America with African Americans was no different in her eyes than what Hitler was doing. I agree, we were just more discreet about it. Perhaps because deep inside, Americans knew it was wrong to treat African Americans as third class citizens so we tried to hide it more. Hitler was right out in the open with his actions.

-	Margaret Mitchell, Gone with the Wind

As Scarlett would say: God‚Äôs nightgown! What a book!

This is an all-time memorable reading experience. 

I loved it! I hated it! It gave me chills. It led me to the brink of tears. It caused me to stress-eat (cheese, handful after handful of shredded cheese). It made me laugh out loud on public transportation. At times, it revolted me. This is 959 pages (in my paperback anniversary edition) that, for better or worse, absolutely creates a world. Not a real world. Not a world that ever existed, per se. But a fully-realized place nonetheless, filled to every corner with memorable characters. 

Margaret Mitchell‚Äôs Gone with the Wind lives up to its reputation, every bit of it, both the good and the bad. 

The plot is America‚Äôs urtext. Everybody knows the highlights, at least as captured by the classic film rendition. In case you‚Äôve entirely managed to avoid Gone with the Wind, it suffices to say that it‚Äôs the story of Katie Scarlett O‚ÄôHara, the young (but eldest) child of Gerald and Ellen, who lives on the Georgia plantation known as Tara. The tale opens shortly after secession has threatened imminent civil war. The coquettish, boy-crazy Scarlett has just found out that her one true love, Ashley Wilkes, is about to marry his cousin Melanie. 

(Aside: In all honesty, I found Scarlett‚Äôs love for Ashley to be one of the harder pills to swallow. I was never convinced that a woman of Scarlett‚Äôs native intelligence and natural fierceness could ever fall under the sway of such a wet noodle. As with other aspects of GWTW, I held my nose and plunged forward). 

We continue to follow Scarlett through the Civil War and Reconstruction ‚Äì a roughly decade-long period ‚Äì as she attempts to rebuild her life from the ashes, while advancing her undying (ugh) love for Ashley. 

Scarlett has to be one of the greatest literary creations in American history. Mitchell deserves kudos for the willingness to make her so fascinatingly multi-dimensional. Scarlett has many fine qualities. She is, in a way, a proto-feminist. She refuses to follow patriarchal strictures. She is ambitious. She is driven and pragmatic and an outside-the-box thinker. She can do math. (The scene where she does sums in her head, to the befuddlement of the men-folk, is so modern it could have been written last week). Scarlett has a bracing clarity when it comes to the conventions and dogmas of her day. 

She is also a fully terrible human being. Spiteful. Wicked. A terrible mother. Unconscionably spoiled and selfish and conceited. As I read these 959 pages, I thought of Scarlett as a plane that has lost propulsion. In contravention to the typical redemption arc, in which a bad character becomes better through hard experience, Scarlett kept losing altitude. Mitchell never quite lets her nosedive, but every time she pulls Scarlett out of a tailspin, she remains lower to the ground. By the end, I had given up on Scarlett completely. It is a testament to the sheer momentum of the plot that Mitchell manages even that much. She convinces you to stick with Scarlett long after we probably should have written her off. 

Mitchell writes from a roving, yet restrained, omniscient third-person perspective. Most of the time, we are tethered to Scarlett, privy to every one of her noxious thoughts and amoral schemes. Every so often, though, and usually with powerful effect, Mitchell will dip into one of the many unforgettable side characters. 

There is Ashley Wilkes, of course, a wishy-washy milquetoast that Mitchell manages to make into the most dynamic wishy-washy milquetoast you‚Äôve ever met. There is Melanie, who at first seems like she was created in the Charles Dickens School of Bland Female Protagonists. Her angelic, saintly presence brought back bad memories of Bleak House‚Äôs Esther Summerson. Again, though, Mitchell refuses to let any major character get pegged. By the end, I was utterly sold on Melanie. And of course, there is Rhett Butler, the debonair blockade runner, who arrives on every scene like a Greek Chorus to ridicule and puncture the Lost Cause myths that, ironically, Mitchell was helping to cement. 

For me, the chief joys come not from the iconic major players, but from the memorable supporting actors. This is a novel that is consistently generous in its cameo appearances. From the comic relief of faint-prone Aunt Pittypat, to the straight-shooting advice of Grandma Fontaine, to the darkly taciturn hillbilly Archie, Mitchell gives almost every single person in this world a minute in the spotlight, a grace note, a funny one-liner, or a piece of wisdom. It is absolutely extraordinary how real Mitchell‚Äôs story feels. Men we barely meet go off to war and don‚Äôt return, and we feel for them, because Mitchell evokes their spirits, their lingering presence, their gaping absences, so well.

The writing is beautiful, the prose superb. She lands her one-liners with effortlessness (‚Äúshe was twenty-five and looked it‚Ä¶‚Äù). Her sense of place is amazing: 

It was a savagely red land, blood-colored after rains, brick dust in droughts, the best cotton land in the world. It was a pleasant land of white houses, peaceful plowed fields and sluggish yellow rivers, but a land of contrasts, of brightest sun glare and densest shade. The plantation clearings and miles of cotton smiled up to a warm sun, placid, complacent. At their edges rose the virgin forests, dark and cool even in the hottest noons, mysterious, a little sinister, the soughing pines seeming to wait with an age-old patience, to threaten with soft sighs: ‚ÄúBe careful! Be careful! We had you once. We can take you back again.‚Äù

The dialogue is excellent. During the exchanges between Rhett and Scarlett it can be as snappy as the best romantic comedies. And the monologues! Oh, the monologues. They are Shakespearian. Rhett‚Äôs final summation to Scarlett, cutting bone deep and brutal. Will Benteen‚Äôs beautiful funeral eulogy. 

When I think of how good GWTW is, I think of Mitchell‚Äôs execution of the Grandma Fontaine speech. She gives a spellbinding peroration about surviving the Creek massacre of Fort Mims, of facing the worst in the world, capping it all with her hushed advice: ‚ÄúScarlett, always save something to fear ‚Äì even as you save something to love.‚Äù

As I finished the passage, I actually stopped reading, looked up, looked around, took a deep breath, mesmerized. Then I looked back down, where Mitchell delivers the deadpan and hilarious kicker: 

Scarlett moved impatiently. She had thought Grandma was going to understand and perhaps show her some way to solve her problems. But like all old people, she‚Äôd gotten to talking about things that happened before anyone was born, things no one was interested in.

I have studied the American Civil War all my life. I despise Lost Cause mythologizing. Here, though, for the first time, I get it. I still don‚Äôt like it, but I understand it. 

The Civil War is remembered very differently between North and South. That‚Äôs a consequence of losing. With a few Lee-inspired exceptions, the war never came into northern territory. That is not true with the South. Mitchell evokes the ravages of the war with incredible detail and emotion. There is a breathtaking scene set after Gettysburg, where everyone in Atlanta is gathering to see who lived and died. There are countless moments of terror, upheaval, hunger, and dislocation. There is a line about a mother whose soldier-children were gone, along with the future: ‚Äú[She] said she never wanted a home again, for what was a home without children and grandchildren in it‚Ä¶‚Äù

This is extremely potent stuff. It moved me, and I‚Äôm typically pretty unmovable when it comes to the distortions of Civil War history. 

And there are distortions. 

 ***

‚ÄúTomorrow is another day.‚Äù

Scarlett‚Äôs famous motto, repeated like a mantra whenever things get tough. 

Let‚Äôs play with that line. Let‚Äôs toy with the meaning. Tomorrow is another day. 

What does that mean if you are an enslaved person, working on a cotton plantation like Tara, part of the gang-system, meaning you are up at dawn and work till dusk, and you have a quota that keeps rising, and you do this every day until you are too old to stoop? In such a marvelous triumph of the imagination, that thought never seems to have crossed Mitchell‚Äôs mind. 

Tomorrow is another day, indeed. 

Though for an enslaved person, it‚Äôll be a lot like yesterday.

***

That‚Äôs my pivot to the thing we need to talk about when we talk about Gone with the Wind. 

Early on, the racism is about what you‚Äôd expect from a book published in the 1930s. The field hands are entirely ignored, while the house servants are the stereotypical ‚Äúhappy slave,‚Äù proud to serve their white masters. Blacks speak in eye dialect, which is not only racist but frustratingly difficult to comprehend. The good white folk, of course, speak the Queen‚Äôs. 

Nevertheless, Mitchell demonstrates interesting glints of comprehension. Scarlett and Rhett, for instance, are very forthcoming that slavery was the cause of the Civil War, which is something I can‚Äôt say for a lot of people I‚Äôve met in the 21st century. This, I think, is a function of Mitchell‚Äôs time. She was close enough to the original Lost Causers that she didn't need to pretend the war started over state‚Äôs rights. It was okay to say it was about slavery, because slavery wasn‚Äôt a moral wrong to her. It was an institution worth defending. 

Certain characters, such as Mammy, Pork, and Uncle Peter, are even given their dignity. They exist only to serve, but at least they are nominally treated as human. That‚Äôs more than any other black person in GWTW can say. The rest are referred to as trash, as loafers, as predators. Still, every time one of the characters exclaims that they have to ‚Äúwork as hard a field hand,‚Äù Mitchell is, perhaps unconsciously, acknowledging the cruelties of slavery. 

There is always a question in fiction between the content and the message. A book‚Äôs content can be horrible without that being the message. Thomas Harris, for example, is not condoning cannibalism, just because he created Hannibal Lecter. When I read John Jakes‚Äô North and South trilogy, which covers the same time period, I never worried (despite some questionable narrative choices) that Jakes was defending a system that legally removed the natural rights of four million men, women, and children. Here, though, I never trusted Mitchell‚Äôs moral compass. To the contrary, I think she endorses most of the questionable messages that Gone with the Wind propounds. 

Specifically, things take a dark turn around the 600-page mark. This is the start of the Reconstruction sections, which last till the final page. Periodically, Mitchell inserts what I‚Äôll call intercalary passages, similar to what Steinbeck did in Grapes of Wrath. These passages are written as objective fact. In reality, they are a funhouse mirror distortion of the tragic Reconstruction Era. 

In Mitchell‚Äôs telling, the northerners and the blacks are the terrorists, rampaging across the defeated south, lynching, raping, stealing. Decent southern whites are rightly horrified by such things as: blacks getting to vote; blacks serving in the legislature; and horror of all horrors, miscegenation. The Ku Klux Klan is the heroic party, here. In his forward to my edition, the novelist Pat Conroy gently chides Mitchell for making the KKK into a ‚Äúbenign combination of the Elks Club and a men‚Äôs equestrian society.‚Äù That‚Äôs putting it too lightly. She makes them into the La R√©sistance (long before the French Resistance became its own tangled mythology). Mitchell‚Äôs inversion of history is stomach curdling. It was like reading Soviet or North Korean propaganda, where you witness a worldview tethered to nothing save a sick ideology. 

One of the defining features of Ms. Mitchell‚Äôs bizarro Reconstruction is the murder of blacks for being ‚Äúuppity.‚Äù This happens with frightening frequency, and is not only condoned, but celebrated. At one point, one of the novel‚Äôs most beloved characters casually admits to slaughtering another human being for the crime of effrontery while black. 

This was published in 1936. Emmett Till wouldn‚Äôt be born for another five years. It would be 19 years before the teenager was beaten, shot, mutilated, and thrown into the Tallahatchie for the crime of speaking to a white woman. The jury deliberated just over an hour in acquitting the killers. It only took that long, one juror said, because they ‚Äústopped to drink pop.‚Äù Mitchell died before Till, meaning she had no way of knowing how her novel‚Äôs ugly leitmotif would manifest in real life. However, reading it today, the ghost of Emmett Till hovers over this rancid perversion of the historical record. The Reconstruction period removed the mask of ‚Äúbenign slavery‚Äù and showed it for what it was: a system built on race-hatred. A system built upon the specific premise that blacks were subhuman. After fighting black equality for a decade, Reconstruction ended, and the South unleashed 100 years of viciously unreconstructed apartheid. 

As Brutus might say, I have come to contextualize Gone with the Wind, not to burn it. I‚Äôm not here to lecture GWTW-lovers about why they are wrong, because I‚Äôm one of the GWTW-lovers. That said, this is fiction, and it should be treated like fiction. More than that, it should be read alongside honest portrayals of the Civil War and Reconstruction. 

Gone with the Wind is often discussed as a contender for that illusive title: the Great American Novel. 

I‚Äôm not going there. I have gone on too long already. Instead I‚Äôll finish with this: 

Gone with the Wind 
is
 America, the sublime and the terrible in eternal, irreconcilable conflict."

Is Orwell turning in his grave? Does his epitaph read. ""I fucking warned you! Don't say I never told you so! ""

Did he have a crystal fucking ball?

***
If you want truth, go out and see

Not like in 1984, Richard Burton on TV

Orwell must have been psychic, or was he in the know

Cos' what's going on in the world clearly shows

That humanity is programmed through a TV screen

Since its conception, its all its ever been

News, films, dramas, sports, soaps and cartoons

Leaving the masses wide eyed, like Buffoons

All the rhetoric and propaganda, oozing about us, every place we look, and go

It is everywhere, embedded, enveloping, as people to and fro

Screens on buildings, bus stops, train stations, all over the place, fuelling our vices

PC's, laptops, google glass, tablets and mobile devices

Its in the ether, the air and the subconscious brain

Whether one is aware or not, the information leaves its stain

Orwell must have been psychic, or was he in the know

Perpetual war, a bogeyman, terrorists, must be real, its all a TV show

Censored press, hacking phones, spying on the masses

Every email, phone call, text message, and google eye glasses

Technocratic Dystopia, hunger games, people put into factions

Not allowed to speak, monitoring our actions

In the name of security, no person is free

Unless your blood is Royal, or have connections to the family

Or a valued member in Vatican State, purple robes, velvet glove, and iron fist

A Freemason, a congressman, senator, president, PM, you get the gist

Social engineering, eugenics, deep state, cabals and satanic cults

Lodges, temples, hail, thunder and lightening bolts

Rapture, ragnarok, jihad, ends of days TV

In dramas, films, cartoons, its all we ever see

Monsters and bogeymen, cold war, terrorism, and disease, and destruction

People trafficking, drug smuggling, arms deals, and child abduction

All entertainment, to keep the masses distracted

No freedom of information, cos the juicy bits are redacted

In the name of security, or for the security of a famous name

The whole thing is inverted, its all a game

Cos' rules are lures, and laws are walls

And all of the people are silly fools

Glued to a PC, Mob Phone or TV screen

Since its conception, its all its ever been

Was Orwell a psychic, or was he in the know

One things for certain, it won't be on a TV show

When one is young and immersed into the seas of academia one is asked what one wants to be when one grows up? Which pigeon hole? What label? What career?

When a car driver loses control of the vehicle and strays from the path that was ahead, the car careers off the road. One might crash. One is no longer on the journey one originally set out on. One is lost. Off the beaten track.

So, when one is a child and asked what career one wants, esoterically it means how can one be swayed or crashed and stopped from what one may want to be when one grows up. The only answer a child should give to their teacher (indoctrinater) is...HAPPY!üëçüêØ

Who are these people? These authorities with all the powers?

Deciding what we say, or do, or go, from their Ivory Towers

A deviant neighbour moves in next door, behaviour abnormal, and hoarding trash

Puts his waste in his shed, a festering, mouldy stash

Attracting rats, mice, flies and vermin of all kinds

Breaking other residents resolve, distorting their minds

For when the community complain about it, every day, week in week out, all the time

These authorities point the finger at us, accuse us of a Bloody Hate Crime!

Rationale has been replaced, with the word Hate

As the lines blur, in this New World Order, is it too late?

To change this world? To take a stance? Maybe our last Chance!

This world is going to Hell in a Shitstorm! If we don't restore the Earth's Balance. üêØüëç


 Politics, or many ticks? Crawling all over society

 Police or Po-Lice? Crawling over people who are Free

Choose and Lose, for they are not there, for the likes of You and Me

Look around and thus, Beware!

 These parasites, are only there to Scare

 To enforce Order, in the chaos they Create

 On behest of the Magicians behind the curtains, the One's that preach Hate. 

In this Cube, this false construct, this Square. 

So look around, see the whole, and Beware!

 I am full aware of what is going on in this pursuit for a New World Order, an Old World Order, whereby the void between the few and the majority broadens. I am so frustrated how the Sheeple just seem to lap it up. Every day the Inter-NET tightens it's grip or, the World Wide Spider Web lures and traps millions with the Glitsy new smart phone. A cell phone. A smart cell phone that is all singing and dancing...Blah! Blah! Blah! It is called a Cell phone for a reason. Like the Net and the Web. Soon all appliances and mob devices will be Smart. If one does not own one then when 5G is rolled out and the Smart Grid comes into being, one will be left behind. Soon all money paid in wages or commerce will be digital and people will not survive in the New Virtual World unless one is chipped or connected to the 5G network. Understand that money is phony. It is paper or a figure on a PC screen. Soon to be a digital concept, like in the film In Time. Money used to be made of copper, silver and gold. This is when coins actually held value, worth it's weight in gold actually meant something. Then the Templars invented the Banking system, (now they are called Freemasons) a Fiat pyramid system that is illegal yet, no person seems to care. That is the way it is. Only because of ignorance. Acquiescence, Taxation is a fraud. It is theft. Time to wake up before it is too late.

Club of Rome, Skull and Bones, Knights of the Realm, Knights of Malta, Rosicrucians, CFR, just a few of the Nefarious institutions. London School Of Economics and the Tavistock Institute. Oh! And the female freemasonic Eastern Star. Maybe I have said too much but, I don't care anymore.

That is today's Rant.

Everybody should read 1984 and also watch the film.

This.Was.Good. It seems like every dystopian book that comes out now is being compared to The Hunger Games. Well, if there was ever a book that might come close to that comparison it would be Enclave and now Divergent.

Veronica Roth's debut novel Divergent is getting some major hype and you know what? I think it deserves it. It's no secret that I have a dystopian society book addiction right now, but Divergent is just what I love in a book. It had loads of action, strong heorine, slow building romance, extremely flawed society, ect. I mean I could go on and on here.

Now, I know what you are thinking, ""B-b-b-but what about your status updates complaining about the world building?!"" Yes, kiddies it's true, I did complain. When I first started reading Divergent I thought the world builing left much to be desired. And even still, the faction Dauntless just doesn't sit right with me (which is why this is a 4 star review and not a 5 star review. Don't worry, I'll address that later.). But, even with these world flaws, I still really loved this book!

Divergent thrusts you into a world where society is divided into five factions each representing a particular virtue. You have Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), Erudite (the intelligent) and Abnegation (the selfless), which our heroine 16-year-old Beatrice is from. In her world when you reach the age of 16 you must choose which faction you want to join. Will you remain with your family in your current faction or risk it for the biscuit learning a whole new way of life? Thankfully, the government graciously provides an aptitude test to help determine which faction you would most likely belong in. But, you always have a choice (or so they say) to pick whichever pre-determined life you want you want regardless of the results. Awesome! High fives all around for free will!





So, what does Beatrice choose? Well Dauntless, of course! This would be a rather boring book if it had been any other faction. If I had to describe Dauntless I would say they are a cross between xtreme sports thrill seekers and a blood thirsty gang. Everytime I turned around the Dauntless were trying to hurl themselves off another building, moving object, or beat the crap out of each other for the sake of being called brave. None of that is brave. It is stupidity at it's best.





This was a constant pet peeve of mine. And the worst part is: beatrice just.accepted.it. Not only that, but she joined in the craziness! And that brings us to the big old negative of the book. There were a few big holes in the world building. Such as, how did the world get to where it is? What is beyond the walls of Beatrice's society? What's the point of having the factionless? They kinda felt like page fillers to me, and most importantly: WHO RUNS THE TRAIN?! I need to know! It's bothering me! Now if you know anything about me, you will know I can not stand when an author builds a world and tells me, ""This is how it is. Just accpet it."" No. Just no. Seriously, it makes my eye twitch.





But, once you get past the sketchy world building the book is good. I think the second half was definately noticably better than the first half. The first half was a bit slow, but once the book got going it hooked me and never let me go. I stayed up until 2 am to finish it and that it epic for me. LOL. Like Power Rangers meeting the Ninja Turtles epic. 





The plot and characters and pretty solid to me. I did like Beatrice and her character development. I also felt like the love intrest between her and (view spoiler)[Four (hide spoiler)] was slow developing and not rushed. It provided a nice build up. For a YA book to do that nowadays, you get bonus points. 

And I really loved the ending. It left me frazzeld and wanting more. 





And best of all there was no cliffhanger! I'm growing to hate clifhangers in YA novels. You don't need to leave me hanging to keep me reading your series. If your writing/story is good enough, I will continue regardless. So I really appreciated things being tied up nicely in this book even though I can tell things are not over. 

So, if you are digging dystopians right now, do yourself a favor and check out Divergent. It's definately one of the best out right now.

607,Eddy Allen,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Apr 18, 2012",1,"While the plot was very gripping and well-written, the book didn't actually instruct me on how to kill a mockingbird. I bought this book intending to do away with this obnoxious bird that's always sitting in my backyard and making distracting noises. I had hoped this book would shed some light on how to humanely dispose of the bird, but unfortunately it was this story about a lawyer and a falsely-accused criminal. As I said, the plot is great but nowhere in the book does it say exactly how to kill a mockingbird."
608,Jason,The Book Thief,"Apr 17, 2011",3,"I write this review under severe duress.

Three-star books are always difficult to review, aren‚Äôt they? They are difficult for me, mostly because I am so dispassionate about them. It‚Äôs much easier to review something you love, or something you hate, rather than something you‚Äôve half-forgotten before you even get to your local library‚Äôs return box.

So this book is fine. Fine. It‚Äôs the story of a young German girl caught in the path of the advancing Nazi regime during World War II. For many German villagers in the late 30s and early 40s, the Third Reich was like a quiet glacier, slowly encroaching on their lives‚Äîit moved languidly enough that disaster seemed never truly imminent (there is always plenty of time to get out of the way), yet it had enough momentum to churn to pulp anything that was unfortunate enough to meet its frothing jaws.

What annoyed me about this book, however, was its distracting style of storytelling. It is told from the point-of-view of the Grim Reaper, the personification of death. I would have actually been okay with this except Death is a grating little sonofabitch. He pretends to keep a distance from the German girl whose story he‚Äôs telling, representing himself as a disinterested party whose job is simply to harvest souls from their lifeless hosts, but over time he becomes clearly vested in her story, and for this he is a failure. I mean, if death and taxes are the only two things I can count on, and the IRS is a bullshit government arm that can‚Äôt find its asshole with a flashlight, then I need to be able to depend on Death not being a loser.

Additionally, I specifically detested the

Which means that there's a lot of pressure riding on any book to live up to its promise, particularly one that comes from a 23-year-old author who has already landed a 3-book deal and signed away the movie rights.

After so many big dollar and wearisome projects such as Halo or Matched, it's a pleasure to find that every once in awhile, there's a good reason behind the fanfare. Divergent is the fast-paced, action-packed story of 16-year-old Tris, who comes from one of the five factions in a dystopian Chicago. She must choose one of the factions--Candor (honesty), Abnegation (selflessness), Dauntless (bravery), Amity (peacefulness), or Erudite (intelligence)--to live in and serve for the remainder of her life. Tris makes the decision to leave her old faction, Abenegation, in favor of Dauntless, and the majority of the book focuses on the dangerous trials that the new initiates must endure in order to find out whether they qualify to stay. Failure means living a factionless life--or death.

The very concept of the novel, however, asks that readers accept a fairly rigid framework for the story. This idea that human beings would sublimate their natural instincts to live in a society where a single virtue is promoted is pretty farfetched; it reminds me of various Star Trek alien races known for a single prevailing characteristic, but at least they are also usually presented along with certain instincts and behaviors that made sense. The division between the factions here doesn't really serve much of a purpose, and is simply explained away as people who chose a lifestyle based on differences in philosophy. Even within the factions, the doctrines don't really hold up under scrutiny--members of Dauntless, for example, are forever indulging in reckless, pointless exercises that are more about posturing than about testing their mettle.

But the thing is, the book is really fun to read. Most of the trials are pretty well thought-out, with scene after scene of nerve-wracking physical and mental tests. I liked the interplay between Tris' fellow initiates, who cautiously bond with each other but also have to look on each other as rivals, and I liked the mysterious and attractive Four, as well as the way her family members' characters eventually revealed themselves. 

Tris herself I had a harder time connecting to, as she's physically very capable but mentally and emotionally it's more difficult to say whether she belongs on my ""butt-kicking heroines"" shelf. Some of her actions also ended up being more self-centered than I expected, mostly because I think the author was trying to show the change in Tris' morphing from Abegnation to Dauntless. But she and Four also make a huge tactical error at a crucial scene late in the book, which negates both Dauntless' philosophy and their training. I'm also not sure that several of the deaths later in the book had the appropriate emotional impact, though there were several other scenes that made me yelp. Let's just say that I gave my knife some pretty fishy looks at the dinner table last night. (view spoiler)[The eye! The eye! Oww. :-O And poor Will, of course. (hide spoiler)]

Still, I had a really good time reading this book, and there's a lot to be said for books that are just plain entertaining. Many of my fellow readers have major issues with the world-building and the plot holes, and I can't say that I disagree with most of the criticisms I've seen. It's certainly not in the same category as The Hunger Games; it's closer to light entertainers such as Blood Red Road or Legend, but I think we often do ourselves a disservice when we endlessly make those kinds of comparisons. It's always important to read with a critical eye--and it's true that with more attention to detail, this book might have been even better--but I don't feel that getting hung up on criticism or comparisons should get in the way of enjoying a book when so many of the other elements do work well. For me, the positives of this adventure outweigh the negatives and in the end, Divergent is still loads of fun to read. I'm looking forward to seeing where the story goes next!

The Kite Runner brought me here; however, I will say that I enjoyed The Kite Runner more. 

This book reminded me a lot of A Woman is No Man, and I also enjoyed that one more than this one. 

One of the things that I didn‚Äôt like about this book is how dark it is. Of course, the subject matter is quite heavy, and it isn‚Äôt meant to be a lighthearted comedy. However, it was just a bit too dark for my liking. Even in dark circumstances, people can still find joy or hope. 

Also, I had a hard time really connecting with Mariam and Laila. There are two things that contributed to this: 1) The author would jump years into the future from one chapter to the next. 2) The author wrote this book in the third-person perspective. It could have been more impactful if the book was written in the first-person perspective, really feeling the characters‚Äô fears and thoughts.

614,Matthew,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Jan 08, 2013",5,"Update ‚Äì 4/4/2022 ‚Äì Reread out loud to my kids

Both of my kids were born after the whole Harry Potter series was released. They are now old enough to start appreciating the story so I thought it would be fun to read it out loud to them. While it did take us a while because, you know . . . life happens . . . we were able to find a few minutes every few nights or so to read a chapter or part of a chapter. It was really fun to see them getting into it. 

They are looking forward to watching the movie and starting in on the Chamber of Secrets!

Original review:

One of my first jobs was at a bookstore. When I was a kid my Mom would take me to the mall and I would spend tons of time hanging out at Waldenbooks (who here remembers Waldenbooks?) Right when I became legally old enough to work, I went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later I was selling literature to the masses.

Why do I tell you this story on this review, you ask? Well, at the time, young adult/teen literature consisted mainly of RL Stein, Christopher Pike, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and a few other classic Newberry Award winners, but certainly we did not have a YA section to the extent you see it today.

Towards the end of my tenure at Waldenbooks - as Oprah's book club was hitting its stride and Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus was in its bazzilionth week on the New York Times best seller list - a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard. I remember the display at the front of the store, and selling a few copies, but I didn't realize what it would become.

A few years later (early 2000s), I had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books. I had just finished college, which had taken up most of my free reading time. A friend of mine named Bronco (yup, real name, not a nickname, who also was the Best Man at my wedding) had a copy of this book on his coffee table. Holy cow! Here is that same book we were selling at Waldenbooks about 5 years before - what was he doing with it!?

Well, he said it was good, so I borrowed it. I quickly plowed through the first 4 books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of Order of the Phoenix. And, I noticed when I went to the bookstore, the YA section and selection was not so small anymore. I truly believe it was Harry Potter that opened the door to get more young adults (and even adults, of course) reading and authors interested in writing for that genre."
615,Charly,Ender's Game ,"Aug 05, 2007",1,"** spoiler alert **
           Spoiler Alert***

God damn did I hate Ender‚Äôs Game. I checked out Amazon and can surely see why I wanted to give it a shot. Talk about a cult following of people absolutely smitten with it. I even read some where that it‚Äôs on the required reading list at Quantico. I suppose this book could be some kind of manifesto for misfit nerds who waste their life playing video games or a source of legitimacy for motivating tired Marines sick of drilling (The book rambles on infinitely about the boy genius Ender and his laser tag in a zero gravity vacuum.) I also suppose we could kid ourselves into thinking the novel brings to light the necessity of Machiavellianism in conflict or maybe we could discuss the pathetic New Age garbage the book ended with as our annoying protagonist spreads some half crocked neo-religion amongst space colonies in which you love the enemy you are forced to annihilate. Some sort of cryptic Latter Day Saints plug by the Mormon author? 

There were several other things I couldn‚Äôt stand about it. First of all, like even the best science fiction, the characters were one dimensional card board cut outs. This starts with the dorky, self absorbed protagonist Ender himself. I can deal with this problem if the plot is cool enough (ala Dune). Dune, too, often times dealt with children geniuses, however it was explained and made sense in the story. We have no idea why Ender and the other children (of which 99.9% were male) are so smart. Speaking of children, did any of you guys pick up any sort of creepy pedophile vibe in this book? How many times were we told of naked little boys? Why were there references to their tiny patches of pubic hair? Why did Ender have to have his big fight naked while lathered with soap in the shower? And the corny Ebonics that the children randomly spoke in? WTF? 

The third rate and minuscule insight we were given about the geopolitical conditions on Earth were terribly dated. The Warsaw Pact dominated by Russia? What a cheap rip of Orwell. Lame! The side story about Ender‚Äôs genius two siblings also using Machiavellian tactics to achieve their political goals (instead of Ender‚Äôs military ones) by blogging on the internet really didn‚Äôt add up to beans in plot development if you ask me. Of course, Ender is never beaten at anything he does. I suppose we are to be awed by his victories but, strangely, his greatest triumph was his stoic willingness to use some sort of super weapon to destroy an enemy wholesale via exploding an entire planet. On the cover of my book, it suggests this book is appropriate for 10 year olds. What could a child get out this book? Boo to Ender‚Äôs Game!!!!!"
616,mark monday,A Game of Thrones ,"Oct 23, 2010",5,"there are about a billion reviews of this one so i doubt i have anything to add. the only thing i feel truly compelled to say is TYRION THE DWARF IS AWESOME! my God, i haven't read a character who is so different and so enjoyable in years. many-layered and consistently surprising, hero & antihero, generous & spiteful in equal amounts, as capable of high-handed miscalculation as he is of clever deduction, brave & loyal & vindictive... just overall a superb creation. Tyrion, you are the tops! and now you're going to be played by the studliest dwarf actor in the business. GO, TYRION, GO!

the novel itself is fast-paced and fun, featuring lavish and completely enjoyable world-building, a narrative that is widescreen in scope but often intimate is scale, some nifty twists, and strong & vivid characterizations. this is not a novel with much idiosyncratic ""style"" but there is a very literary feel to it nonetheless. it is complex but straightforward, nuanced, carefully planned writing, in the classic historical-novel mode... but made grand & epic by the range of fascinating (and overlapping) multiple perspectives. the action scenes are sparse but very well-rendered; the magic is likewise rare but that rarity make each appearance even more fascinating. although it is all rather archetypal and familiar, it is still never less than pleasing.

when thinking on it again, a few months after first reading it, everything just seems perfectly accomplished, even meaningful. DING DING DING!! you & your sequel just won 1 more star, congratulations amazing novel!"
617,emma,Animal Farm: George Orwell ,"Nov 25, 2014",4,"i'm sure this book was very good when it came out in 19whatever (i could check this but warning - i am going to spend this review being as annoying as possible to a certain group), but it's way, way better now.

in whatever time of the 20th century this came out during, this was thought to be written in opposition to stalinist russia. that's fine. whatever. not exactly a hot take for a white guy from the western world to be anti-USSR. 

but now...now it's abundantly clear.

if it weren't already obvious that this book is written about how bad totalitarianism is (as opposed to being specifically about communism), take a look at the world around us, then check it against orwell's political views, then come back to me.

a certain political faction (of evil morons) in my certain country i live in (take a wild guess) likes to call certain things (the ones that are against them) ""orwellian.""

nonwhite people entering your country? orwellian. having to be nice to others and not call them slurs? orwellian. the idea of people not appreciating your opinions and thereby being ""anti-free speech"" (even though that is not what free speech is)? orwellian.

ignoring the fact that the very idea of their using the word orwellian to serve their purposes is far more, well, orwellian, i'll just come out and say it: because people on the right don't know how to read, they haven't ever actually really thought about or analyzed either this or 1984. so they assume that george orwell is on their side - the pro-rich getting richer and anti-poor not being poor side.

but, my dear conservative friends, orwell was an outspoken democratic socialist from top to bottom.

so maybe pick one of the copious number of far-right classic authors to support your dumbass point.

oh? there aren't really any to be found?

bummer. maybe next millennium.

618,Miranda Reads,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Sep 13, 2018",1,"All I have to say to the author is...REALLY? Are you effing kidding me right now?? 

Charlie is a freshman, a loner and an odd duck, all wrapped up in one stunningly awkward package. 

How awkward? Cripplingly so. 
I am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other.
He's always been a bit....out there...but his family knows how to handle his moods and step around his antics. 
So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.
Only, he's now in high school, and the things he would get away with in middle school aren't exactly going to fly now that he's in the big leagues, and he's having difficulties adjusting.

Luckily, he met Sam and and a few other friends...and with them, things are finally looking up.

So. 

Sooooo.

Sooooooooooooooo.......here's my problems with this novel - it ticks too many boxes, The Charlie Cringe and I honestly thought the novel was going a completely different direction.


This book ticks too many boxes - aka is there anything NOT covered in here?
 

It feels like the author googled ""Most traumatizing teen issues"" and then, looking at the list of twenty-or-so of them, says, ""F*ck it. I'll throw them all in.""

I mean, really. 

Does anyone expect to adequately cover suicide, mental illness, alcohol, drugs, sexual orientation, first-time-sex, incest, abuse, rape, and more in a single 200ish page novel?

That's right, you can't. 

But you can sure as hell definitely cram all of those buzzwords into one book and throw in a few fancy-sounding quotes, like this:
We accept the love we think we deserve.
and this:
And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.
And boom. Instant classic. 

The audience is shuffled from one BIG issue to the next BIG thing without any development.

That's what frustrated me so much - we have these huge, hard-hitting issues...and nothing is dealt with. 


The Charlie Cringe -  aka holy sh*t that's a lot of crinnnnge.


And Charlie, while he is cute and adorable, his whole character just didn't feel authentic to me - the dialogue, the actions, the issues.

 And I'm speaking from the perspective of a wallflower - I was a quiet kid but I was NO where near Charlie-level crinnnge.

Okay. You may be wondering, what level of cringe are we talking about?

He's blessed by the two coolest kids in the school taking him under their wing and made him their best friend. 

Personally, I find that the odds that these two popular senior kids adopting the cripplingly awkward freshman to be astronomical...but hey, it's fiction. 

Anyway, Charlie feels like he can say anything on his mind to these seniors. And what does he tell them? 

Everything.

 And by everything, I mean EVERYTHING.

For example, he confesses a sex dream about one of them 
to their face
 because he felt guilty. And they find it charming.

Just. What the what?

Is this really supposed to be high school? 

I'm just like...I may have been a wallflower, but thank GOD I wasn't 
this bad of a wallflower.



 I honestly thought the novel was going a completely different direction - aka am I the only one?


Charlie supposed to be this super smart kid, with reading comprehension off the charts (based on the English essays he writes).

...but his monologue sounds like an eight-year-old with a bucket of sugar and a microphone.

How can you write essay after essay on great and notable works of English that absolutely boggle the mind of your teacher...and when you pen a letter, you sound like this: 
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning
or like this:
And I thought about how many people have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud. 
Honestly, for the first 2/3 I thought he was slow or autistic and this is one of those books where everyone knows but the kid (and he finds out in some hugely traumatizing way).

I mean, the signs were all there.

He has emotional episodes, monologues like he's half his age and just seems so spaced out all the time.

At one point, he watches a drunk girl get raped (forced to give a blow job to a much more sober guy). 

And by watches - he's in the same room, silently staring from a corner - doesn't intervene or do anything other than watch. AND he only realizes she got raped weeks later. 

How is this kid classified only as a wallflower?

I really, truly thought we were going to find out that the popular kids were only nice to him because he was ""special"" - honestly, am I the only one who had these thoughts? Am I just going completely left-field on this book?

Jeez. 

Ah well, I don't know, maybe it's just me but I'm really (really) grateful there isn't a sequel.

619,Richard Derus,Pride and Prejudice,"Jun 24, 2010",4,"Well-loathed books I've re-read

Rating: 4 very annoyed, crow-feathered stars out of five

The Book Report: No. Seriously. If your first language isn't English, or if you're like nine years old, you might not know the story. Note use of conditional. 

 
My Review: All right. All right, dammit! I re-read the bloody thing. I gave it two stars before. I was wrong-headed and obtuse and testosterone poisoned. I refuse to give it five stars, though. Look, I've admitted I was wrong about how beautiful the writing is, and how amusing the story is. Don't push.

Stephen Sullivan, who rated this with six stars of five, is now on a summer travel break from Goodreads, so I can publish this admission: He was right. It is a wonderful book. I had to grow into it, much as I had to grow into my love for Mrs. Dalloway. But now that I'm here, I am a full-on fan.

Deft is a word that seems to have been created for Austen. She writes deftly, she creates scenes deftly. She isn't, despite being prolix to a fault, at all heavy-handed or nineteenth-century-ish in her long, long, long descriptions. She is the anti-Dickens: Nothing slapdash or gimcrack or brummagem about her prose, oh nay nay nay. Words are deployed, not flung or splodged or simply wasted. The long, long, long sentences and paragraphs aren't meant to be speed-read, which is what most of us do now. They are meant to be savored, to be treated like Louis XIII cognac served in a cut-crystal snifter after a simple sole meuni√®re served with haricots verts and a perfect ripe peach for dessert.

The romantic elements seem, at first blush, a wee tidge trite. And they are. Now. Why are they? Because, when Miss Jane first used them in Pride and Prejudice, they worked brilliantly and they continue so to do unto this good day. Why? Because these are real feelings expressed in a real, genuine, heartfelt way, as constrained by the customs of the country and times. And isn't that, in the end, what makes reading books so delicious? I, a fat mean old man with no redeeming graces, a true ignorant lower-class lout of the twenty-first century, am in full contact with the mind, the heart, the emotional core of a lady of slender means born during the reign of George III.

You tell me what, on the surface of this earth, is more astonishing, more astounding, more miraculous than that. Jane Austen and I Had A Moment. She's Had A Moment with literally millions of English-speakers for over 200 years. She's had moments with non-English speakers for more than a century. Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are cultural furniture for a large percentage of the seven billion people on the planet. (Large here is a relative term. Less than one? Still amazing for a book 200 years old.)

Reading is traveling in time, in space, but most importantly inside. Inside yourself, inside the characters' emotions, inside the author's head and heart. It is a voyage of discovery, whether you're reading some bizarro mess, Dan Brown's mess, religious tracts, Twilight, whatever. You-the-reader are going somewhere in a more intimate contact than you-the-reader have with any other being on the planet. Movies, TV, sex, none of them take you as deep into the essence of feeling and emotion as reading does. And no, snobs, it does NOT matter if it's well written, it matters that the book speaks to the reader. (Sometimes, of course, what one learns is how very shallow and vapid some people are...I'm lookin' at you, Ms. Fifty Shades.)

So I thank that rotten, stinkin' Stephen-the-absent Sullivan, safe in the knowledge he won't see me admitting this, for reminding me to live up to my own goal of remaining open to change. I heard him yodeling his rapture, and I revisited the book, and I learned something valuable: 

Only admit you're wrong when the person you don't want to embarrass yourself in front of isn't around to see."
620,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),The Help,"Jul 09, 2019",5,"This is one of those few books where people have a polarising opinion. Some loved reading it, while some others detested it.

Kathryn Stockett tries to tell us the story of the life of two African American housemaids named Aibileen and Minnie in Mississippi. The racism and rejection they had to face in their life and how they faced it with courage form the crux of this story. 

Even though the character creation of Skeeter by Stockett has some cliches, we will still like the way the author crafted this story due to the way she unravels the complex plot enmeshed with various themes with a Surgeons precision. I loved the way the author made sure that this novel never becomes pedantic or preachy in any place. 

I also equally loved watching the silver-screen version of this book. Some of the events mentioned in this book have the propensity to disconcert you to a certain extent. Still, I can easily say that this is one of those rare books that you should never miss.

621,Tadiana ‚ú©Night Owl‚òΩ,Anne of Green Gables ,"Mar 08, 2013",5,"The beloved classic 1908 novel about an orphan girl who mistakenly comes to the Prince Edward Island home of aging brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, who just wanted an orphan boy to help Matthew with chores. After an initial kerfuffle about sending Anne back to the orphanage and getting the boy they had intended, hearts are softened, and Anne proceeds to upend their lives ... in what turns out to be very good ways for everyone involved.

Anne is eleven years old when she first comes to Green Gables, and the novel follows her adventures over the next five years. It‚Äôs kind of an episodic novel, with memorable characters. Anne is a chatterbox with a tremendously vivid imagination, passionate and sincere. Marilla and Matthew are drawn so well that I feel like I really know them (though it's disconcerting to realize that Matthew in the book has a long beard. My mind's eye refuses to see him that way, LOL. The miniseries has co-opted my imagination). And then there's Anne‚Äôs classmate Gilbert, who lives to regret some initial teasing about Anne's hair.



This novel has a healthy sense of humor that sets it apart from most literature of this period and keeps it from being too sticky sweet. It‚Äôs really so charming, with great insights into human nature, and lovely descriptions of P.E.I. It's a feel-good story and a total comfort read!



Anne of Green Gables spawned a slew of sequels and five other related novels, not to mention any number of film and TV adaptations. Not all of the sequels are great reads like this one - they start getting progressively more sappy - but I do recommend the first four books in this series if you liked this one."
622,m.,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"May 06, 2021",0,what a silly little gay book
623,Susan,Little Women,"Oct 04, 2007",5,"Someone I know claimed this no longer has value, that she would never recommend it because it's saccharine, has a religious agenda, and sends a bad message to girls that they should all be little domestic homebodies. I say she's wrong on all counts. This is high on my reread list along with Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre, and a Tree Grows in Brooklyn--you could say that I'm pretty familiar with it. 

Let's see--there's a heroine who not only writes, but is proud of the fact and makes a profit from it in a time that this was somewhat out-of-the-ordinary. Reading this, and especially knowing later that the main character is (for all practical purposes) Alcott herself, inspired me to write myself, and I haven't forgotten the writing lessons even today: don't let money cloud your vision, write for yourself first, take criticism, write what you know. Still wise even today. Also in this book, we see the perspective of a family coping with the financial and emotional strain of having a loved one away at war, something that is unfortunately all too relatable today. There's also (extraordinary in those times, common in ours)a platonic, though not uncomplicated, friendship between a man and a woman that is sort of a different kind of love story in a way and a powerful one at that. We see people getting married, but marriage is never portrayed as The Answer to Everything--many of the matches involve sacrifice and struggling. The girls, though good at heart, aren't a picture-perfect family of saints. They're flawed and human. The paragon Beth would seem the exception, but the message with her is more about how even the quietest among us can make an impact on the world--not parading her isolated life as an example, only her kindness. 

I won't lie. Someone dies, there's a war and a father's away--so yes, God is mentioned: I think there's a few Pilgrim's Progress references in passing and there's some talk of faith at moments when the characters most need it. To contemporary readers, this may seem like a lot, but heavy-handed it is not. It was probably somewhat unusual for its time. The thought that everyone's relationship and perception of God could greatly vary, and that to be true to your religion was entirely non judgmental and meant being kind to other people and trying to make yourself better, not other people? The thought that each person must be allowed to deal with these feelings in their own time in their own way? Wacky stuff. 

I admit it seems like a tough sell to today's kids, packaged in somewhat formal sounding-language, and bearing every indication of being literary broccoli, but this book is a classic for a reason. It might be a tough sell, but I don't think we should give up on trying to think of ways to do it anyway. What's inside still counts. Don't write it off.

624,Tadiana ‚ú©Night Owl‚òΩ,Jane Eyre,"Feb 11, 2013",5,"I'm bumping Jane Eyre up to the full five stars on this reread. It has its Victorian melodramatic moments (horrible aunt! and cousins! (view spoiler)[mad wife secretly hidden away in the attic! heroine starving in the wilderness! (hide spoiler)]), but overall I found this story of a plain, obscure girl determined to maintain her self-respect, and do what she feels is right even in the face of pressure, profoundly moving. And I'm a romantic, sorry/notsorry, so that aspect totally sucked me in too. And it really is a great romance, at least in my book, but it's just so much more than that.

Reasons I Love Jane Eyre:
1. Jane is no beauty. There's no Cinderella moment. Deal with it. Her beauty is all on the inside.
2. Rochester is not gorgeous. This is not going to change either. In fact, his outward appearance gets worse in the end. And it doesn't matter! When's the last time you read a romance where neither the heroine nor the hero was good-looking?
3. Great dialogue. Rochester makes sarcastic comments to Jane all the time. She sasses him right back.
4. This is a romance of the mind and the heart, not just OMG HE'S SO HOT AND HIS LIPS MAKE ME MELT. (Though there's definitely physical attraction here too.)
5. Jane maintains her pride and self-respect. She sticks to her principles, even when the pressure's on, even when it would be much easier, and would bring her much more short-term happiness, to let those principles go hang.
6. Jane Eyre takes a very nuanced view of religion: there are hypocrites, in at least a couple of different variations. There are hard, cold people who sometimes use religion as a tool, or an excuse for what they do. There are saintly characters who always turn the other cheek. And there are believers, like Jane, who are imperfect but are doing the best they can. 
7. Jane teaches us that we have a great power to take control of our lives and decide our own destiny, even when the cards are all stacked against us. It's up to us to take action to change our lives, not wait for someone else to change it for us.
8. Jane Eyre empowered women, written at a time when in so many ways we were considered second-class citizens. It still empowers us now.Women ... feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.Buddy (re-)read with Jess, Karly, Vane, Kristin, Rabbit, and Andrea.

P.S. The Kindle version available for free at Project Gutenberg has wonderful pencil drawing illustrations.

625,Reading_ Tamishly,Charlotte's Web,"Apr 11, 2020",5,"I feel like I did something right by picking up this book years after of having it in my to-be-read list!

I picked it up at the right time (as on 11th April 2020) as I have picked up this book at least 4 times before during a span of 2 years.

At first I thought it would be a really short children's fiction with lots of pictures of animals and the family of the little girl on the book cover.

But I got genuinely surprised the way it weaved an unforgettable story of various animals with distinct personalities who live in a barn together sharing the ups and downs of life.

I would say this book is pretty insightful in understanding kids from their perspective as well as some very useful information regarding the animals (Charlotte the spider as one of the main characters which is one of the best nonhuman fictional characters ever, Wilbur the pig which was almost given up for being the weakest at birth, Templeton the rat which is notorious for his catty remarks, the geese family which speaks the truth and provided entertainment during the whole story). The way these characters were written, how bits of information about these animals were interwoven in the story isn't like a chore as it tends to happen in most of children's books. This book is entertaining, this book is fun to read. It is packed with emotions. It ended beautifully!

You won't believe I cried towards the end of the book. The story seems so real. A good book is a good book. No matter for whom it's written for.

I am so glad I read this book finally!

*The story highlights:
üìå Being empathetic towards animals of all kinds

üìå Friendship that is loyal and unforgettable

Here's something about Charlotte the spider from Wilbur the pig:

""She was in a class by herself. It is not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both.""

(You would be really lucky to have a friend like this who you would say this to.
But even more lucky if you have someone who say this to you.)

üìå Parents who are not overbearing. Parents who has the sense to listen to their kids. Parents who does not behave like know-it-alls and who have the sense to take help when needed.

üìå The gullible nature of us human adults

üìå The author is really witty!"
626,chai ‚ô°,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Sep 30, 2018",4,"Facts that I know for sure:

1. I got this edition because I'm a slave to the aesthetics and that's exactly the kind of motive the ghost of Oscar Wilde would approve of

2. It‚Äôs safe to assume that no matter what I‚Äôm doing, at any given moment in time, at least 20% of my brain capacity is perpetually dedicated to making sure I am clever enough, gay enough, and dramatic enough to earn the approval of the ghost of Oscar Wilde"
627,Stephen,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Mar 18, 2010",5,"6.0 stars. I know I am risking a serious ‚ÄúFILM AT 11‚Äù moment and a club upside the head from Captain Obvious for voicing this, but nabbit dog I still think it needs to be said‚Ä¶TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of the BEST and MOST IMPORTANT American novels ever written. Okay, I said it, and I will wait patiently while you get your DUHs and DERs out of the way and hang your ‚Äúno shit‚Äù signs outside for Inspector Holmes.

Okay, now given the gruntload of reviews/ratings this book has I know I‚Äôm not the first person to wag my chin about how amazing it is. Still, I am going to chance coming off like that annoying dingleberry at the tail end of a huge porcelain party because I truly have a pile of love for this book. ‚Ä¶(Sorry for taking the metanalogy there just now, but I promise no more poop references for the rest of the review)... So if my review can bring a few more people into the Atticus Finch Fan Club, I will be just flush with happy. 

On one level, this book is a fairly straight-forward coming of age story about life in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression. It has a very slice of lifesaver warmth and simplicity to it that I think resonates with a lot of readers. It certainly does with me and I think the adjective ‚Äúcharm‚Äù may have been invented to describe the novel. 

Despite how easing flowing the narrative is, this book is both extremely and deceptively powerful in its discussion of race, tolerance and human decency. Most importantly, this book shows us by example the courage to stand all up in the grill of injustice and say ‚ÄúNot today, Asshole! Not on my watch.‚Äù 

That is a lesson that I think we can never be reminded of too often. When bad people do bad things to good people, the rest of us good people need to sack up and be counted regardless of how scary it might be. Easier said then done, I know. But at least that should be the standard to which we strive. 

Atticus Fitch is the epitome of that standard. He is the role model to end all role models and what is most impressive is that he comes across as such a REAL person. There is no John Wayne/Jack Bauer/Dirty Harry cavalry charging BSD machismo about him. Just a direct, unflinching, unrelenting willingness to always do what he thinks is right. As Atticus‚Äô daughter Scout puts it so well: 
It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived.
I was to make something crystal before going on because it is an important part of my love of this story. Notwithstanding this book's powerful, powerful moral message, it never once‚Ä¶ever‚Ä¶comes off as preachy or heavy handed. There is no lecture to be given here. The only sermon we are privy to is the example of Atticus Finch and the simple yet unwavering strength and quiet decency of the man. Even when asked by his daughter about the horrendous racism being displayed by the majority of the townsfolk during a critical point in the story, Atticus responds with conviction but without: 
 ""They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.""
This is a special story. Oh, and as a huge bonus‚Ä¶it is also an absolute joy to read. Lee‚Äôs prose is silky smooth and as cool as the other side of the pillow. Read this book. Read it with your children, read it with your spouse, read it by yourself‚Ä¶.read it the bigoted assclown that you work with or see around the neighborhood‚Ä¶Just make sure you read it. It is a timeless classic and one of the books that I consider a ‚Äúlife changer.‚Äù 6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!!!

BONUS QUOTE: This is Scout talking to Atticus after getting to know someone she had previously be afraid of: 

‚Äú ‚ÄòWhen they finally saw him, why he hadn‚Äôt done any of those things . . . Atticus, he was real nice. . . .‚Äô His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me. ‚ÄòMost people are, Scout, when you finally see them.‚Äô He turned out the light and went into Jem‚Äôs room. He would be there all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.‚Äù(Emphasis added)"

Dear Charlie,

First of all, thank you for sending me your poignant letters. I'm honored you think of me as a person that didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though I could have. I'm ecstatic you decided to allow me to read your thoughts. I'm glad you proved to be such a great letter-writer/story-teller. I am really quite happy about this.

It was nice receiving letters from you, even though they're dated long ago. I know that I got them for only a couple of months (in a span of one year), but it felt like you've been talking to me since you were very young. (Remember that memory you called the first one you ever remembered?) I sometimes felt like the things you were pouring out in your letters were a little too personal, but you let me into your head, into your heart, into your soul. 

With only your words, I saw you ""participate"", I saw you have friends, I saw you fall in love, I saw you grow. I may not have ever seen you or the persons you know personally, but I could almost taste your fries from that fastfood chain, I could almost hear Mary Elizabeth's chatter, I could almost see Patrick's smile, I could almost feel the winter cold of your world there. Your friends and family were as real to me as if I saw them every single day of my life.

Now... While I was glad you were very honest in your letters, I have to admit that your highs and lows were brutal and enlightening to me, as they were to you. Your first kiss (remember her tears?), your first ""girlfriend"" (e.e. cummings will always remind me of her), your first experiments with different substances (I was a little appalled, a little sad, a little curiously happy for you), your first drive (oh, the silly sophomores), your first mix tape (thank you very much for introducing me to a number of memorable songs!), your first time watching the last episode of M*A*S*H (I promise to keep that incident secret, too). You had your issues, but you seemed more interested in those of others. I felt more than a little sad when you were being too nice to some people... But boy was I rather depressed when you had to be all alone! I wish I could've always been there, instead of reading of your exploits on a date after you've had them.

I'll sincerely cherish your words, your thoughts, your ideas. Thank you very much for the pop culture references - you surely made me add more books and more songs and more ""films"" to my to-check-out list!

I'm a little sad that I haven't gotten any more letters from you after that last one, but I understand. I'm sure you're doing well, and rest assured: I'll always be here to hear you out when you need it.

Thank you for being so wonderfully Charlie-esque. Thank you for letting me feel infinite.

Love always,
Your friend"
630,Dave,1984,"Jul 28, 2007",5,"In George Orwell's 1984, Winston Smith is an open source developer who writes his code offline because his ISP has installed packet sniffers that are regulated by the government under the Patriot Act. It's really for his own protection, though. From, like, terrorists and DVD pirates and stuff. Like every good American, he drinks Coca-Cola and his processed food has desensitized his palate to all but four flavors: sweet, salty-so-that-you-will-drink-more-coca-cola, sweet, and Cooler Ranch!(tm). His benevolent overlords have provided him with some war happening somewhere for some reason so that he, and the rest of the population, can be sure that the government is really in his best interests. In fact, the news always has some story about Paris Hilton or yet another white girl who has been abducted by some evil bastard who is biologically wired by 200,000 years of human evolution to fuck 12-year-olds, but is socially conditioned to be obsessed with sex, yet also to feel guilty about it. This culminates into a distorted view of sexuality, and results in rape and murder, which both make for very good news topics. This, too, is in Winston's best interests because, while fear is healthy, thinking *too* much about his own mortality is strictly taboo, as it may lead to something dangerously insightful, and he might lose his taste for Coca Cola and breast implants. The television also plays on his fears of the unknown by exaggerating stereotypes of minorities and homosexuals, under the guise of celebrating ""diversity"", but even these images of being ghetto-fabulous and a lisping interior designer actually exist solely to promote racism and homophobia, which also prove to be efficient distractions.

For some reason, Winston gets tired of eating recycled Pop Tarts and eating happy pills and pretending to be interested in sports and manufactured news items. But, in the end, they fix him and he's happy again. Or something."

633,Federico DN,The Little Prince,"Feb 24, 2014",5,"‚ÄúWhat is essential is invisible to the eyes.‚Äù  

Saint-Exup√©ry‚Äôs plane crashes in the middle of the Sahara desert; with limited supplies and no hopes of finding help, his time is short to fix his airship. One day after waking up he finds a beautiful young boy playing on the sand, and starts to wonder if he may be losing his mind. Is he dehydrated and the boy a product of his imagination? Who is that little boy and what on earth is he doing in the middle of the desert? And why does he keeps asking to draw him a sheep?

One of the firsts books I picked up from my parent‚Äôs bookcase, if not the very first. A book I read during my teens and deeply LOVED, with a soul shattering ending that I never fully recovered from. To this day I think this is the first book I read with a devastating ending.

A book everyone should try to read at least once in their lifetime, but never force it. I think it‚Äôs essential for this book to come just at the right invisible time, and very important to keep an open mind about it. Don‚Äôt over analyze it too much, and it should be easy to enjoy. I think any kid can love it, or any adult with a healthy child at heart. 

A must read in life. Extremely Recommendable.

*** The Little Prince (2015) is a beautifully touching movie that has much and little to do with the original work. This film is more of a modern retelling of what ‚ÄòThe Little Prince 1 & 2‚Äô would‚Äôve been, if such a sequel existed. Still, of all the adaptations I‚Äôve watched (which is to say the only one in this case ehem), it‚Äôs so VERY worth it. An extremely heartfelt animation and something any reader of the Little Prince would probably love. A fantastic film with gorgeous artwork and an amazing voicing cast. Very Recommendable. Just mind it includes a lot more stuff than just a plain adaptation.

 ‚ÄúLo esencial es invisible a los ojos.‚Äù  

El avi√≥n de Saint-Exup√©ry se estrella en medio del desierto del Sahara; con escasos recursos y sin esperanza de hallar ayuda, su tiempo es corto para tratar de arreglar su nave. Un d√≠a al despertar se encuentra con un hermoso joven muchacho jugando en la arena, y se empieza a preguntar si tal vez est√© perdiendo la cabeza. ¬øEst√° deshidratado y el ni√±o un producto de su imaginaci√≥n? ¬øQui√©n es ese muchachito y qu√© por los cielos est√° haciendo en el medio del desierto? ¬øY por qu√© sigue insistiendo en que le dibuje una oveja?

Este fue uno de los primeros libros que escog√≠ de la biblioteca de mis viejos, si no es que el mism√≠simo primero. Un libro que le√≠ durante mi adolescencia y AME profundamente, con un final que parte el alma y del cual nunca llegu√© a recuperarme completamente. Hasta el d√≠a de hoy creo que es el primer libro que le√≠ con un final devastador.

Un libro que todo el mundo deber√≠a intentar leer al menos una vez en la vida, pero sin jam√°s forzarlo. Creo que es esencial que este libro llegue justo en el invisible momento adecuado, y muy importante leerlo con una mente abierta. No sobre analizarlo demasiado, y seguramente ser√° f√°cil disfrutarlo. Creo que cualquier ni√±o puede amarlo, o cualquier adulto con un ni√±o saludable en su interior.

Un deber para leer en la vida. Extremadamente Recomendable. 

*** El Principito (2015) es una hermosamente conmovedora pel√≠cula que tiene mucho y poco que ver con la obra original. Este filme es una especie de recreaci√≥n moderna de lo que ser√≠a ‚ÄòEl Principito 1 & 2‚Äô, si dicha secuela existiera. Igual, de todas las adaptaciones que vi (que dicho sea de paso es una sola en este caso ehem), esta lo vale MUCHO. Una extremadamente emotiva pel√≠cula animada y algo que cualquier lector del Principito probablemente amar√≠a. Una fant√°stica y bell√≠sima obra art√≠stica con un excelente elenco de voces. Muy Recomendable. S√≥lo sepan que incluye muchas m√°s cosas que una simple adaptaci√≥n.

It is my youngest child's turn to discover the joys and sorrows of friendship and of life, as presented by one of my favorite writers, Mr. E. B. White. Rest in peace, Andy, you beautiful man.

Original review:
This is quite ridiculous, that I should read this, at 42-years-old, for the third time in my life, and end up blubbering hot tears all over my face and down the front of my shirt. 

I can't get over that my youngest, at 5-years-old, sat through the entire book this week, mesmerized by the brilliant and timeless story-telling. She giggled, frequently, at the funny passages, and then she laughed at me, her grown mother, crying a river for the last 40 pages. I honestly cried to the point of being physically incapable of reading out loud.

And then, as Charlotte's babies drifted away shouting ""Good-bye! Good-bye! Good-bye!"" my daughter's face contorted strangely and the next thing I knew, she was face down on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably.

This is one powerful story."
636,Federico DN,The Hunger Games ,"Mar 11, 2014",5,"Dystopian Perfection.  

In a post-apocalyptic future, life has turned extremely hard. Fighting poverty and hunger every day, sixteen years old hunter Katniss does absolutely everything in her power to have enough for her defenseless little sister, and a barely lucid mother. Life is hard, yet not impossible, until the one fateful day arrives. Once every year, the ever vigilant all powerful Capitol of Panem celebrates for their entertainment the ‚ÄúHunger Games‚Äù, a yearly tournament where a handful representatives of each district are forced to fight in a massive arena, to the death. In a sad turn of events, young Katniss will have to fight not only for herself, but for the future of her starving family.

I think this series needs as much introduction as Lord of the Rings; but what the hey, old habits die hard. Maybe not everyone has read it, maybe not everyone has watched it, but doubt anyone has never heard of it at some point. One of the greatest dystopian fiction of all time, or at least one of the best-selling ones. A literature masterpiece? Hardly. One of the most entertaining ever? Quite possibly! Astounding world building and character development. Not a profound reading at all, but a plot perfectly balanced, fast paced and action packed; if you can withstand YA that is, and the triangle thingy. Along with Percy Jackson and Divergent, one of the pillar series that sparked my literary addiction. Highly Recommendable.

*** Hunger Games (2012) is a superb adaptation, maybe as good as the book, if not better. Highly popcorn and re-watch worthy. I don‚Äôt normally reread, or feel the desire to; but lost count of how many times I‚Äôve watched the movie on TV. It just never gets old, and is perfect, for what it is; really bringing the characters alive in a way a book never can, and few adaptations ever succeed. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson just marvelous in their roles, with an unforgettably heartbreaking performance by Amandla Stenberg as Rue too. Still, even a decade later I can never forget that Madge Undersee was left out of the adaptation; and the Tessera system hardly explained or mentioned; along with a few other minor things cut out. Not one of the greatest films but one of the greatest adaptations ever, hands down. One of those few cases where I think I ultimately prefer the movie rather than the book. Extremely Recommendable.

 Perfecci√≥n Dist√≥pica.  

En un futuro post apocal√≠ptico, la vida se ha vuelto extremadamente dura. Luchando contra la pobreza y el hambre cada d√≠a, la cazadora Katniss de diecis√©is a√±os hace todo lo humanamente posible en su poder para tener lo suficiente para su indefensa peque√±a hermana, y una apenas l√∫cida madre. La vida es dif√≠cil, pero no imposible, hasta que un d√≠a llega el fat√≠dico d√≠a. Una vez cada a√±o, el siempre vigilante y todo poderoso Capitolio de Panem celebra para su entretenimiento los ‚ÄúJuegos del Hambre‚Äù, un evento anual en una masiva arena donde un pu√±ado de representantes de cada distrito son forzados a lugar, hasta la muerte. En un triste giro de eventos, la joven Katniss deber‘ï luchar no s√≥lo por s√≠ misma, sino por el futuro de su hambrienta familia.

Creo que esta serie necesita tanta introducci√≥n como El Se√±or de los Anillos; pero qu√© demonios, los viejos h√°bitos nunca descansan. Tal vez no todos lo hayan le√≠do, tal vez no todos lo hayan visto, pero dudo que nadie no haya escuchado hablarlo en alg√∫n momento. Una de las m√°s grandes ficciones dist√≥picas de toda la historia, o al menos de las que mejor vendieron ¬øUna obra maestra literaria? Dif√≠cilmente ¬øUna de las m√°s entretenidas jam√°s? Muy probablemente. Incre√≠ble construcci√≥n de mundo y desarrollo de personajes. No una lectura muy profunda en absoluto, pero con una trama perfectamente balanceada, r√°pida en el ritmo y cargada de acci√≥n; si pod√©s soportar lo Joven Adulto claro, y el coso ese del tri√°ngulo. Junto con Percy Jackson y Divergente, una de las series pilares que encendieron mi adicci√≥n literaria. Altamente Recomendable. 

*** Los Juegos del Hambre (2012) es una sobresaliente adaptaci√≥n, tal vez tan buena como el libro, sino mejor. Altamente digna de palomitas y volver a ver una y otra vez. Normalmente nunca releo, ni siento el deseo; pero perd√≠ la cuenta de cu√°ntas veces he visto la pel√≠cula por TV. Nunca se gasta, y es perfecta, para lo que es; realmente trayendo a la vida a los personajes de una forma que un libro nunca puede, y pocas adaptaciones llegan a lograr. Jennifer Lawrence y Josh Hutcherson absolutamente maravillosos en sus roles, con una inolvidablemente desgarradora actuaci√≥n de Amandla Stenberg como Rue tambi√©n. Igual, incluso una d√©cada despu√©s no puedo olvidar que cortaron a Madge Undersee fuera la trama; y el sistema de las Teselas apenas explicado o mencionado; entre otras peque√±as cosas que quedaron fuera. No una de las mejores pel√≠culas pero s√≠ una de las mejores adaptaciones jam√°s, sin duda. Uno de esos casos donde creo que en √∫ltima instancia prefiero la pel√≠cula sobre el libro. Extremadamente Recomendable.

637,Elle (ellexamines),Dracula,"Aug 24, 2018",5,"I find Victorian horror so interesting as a microcosm of reaction to social norms of the time, to the buttoned-down and repressed social climate of the time, to the ‚Äúnew moral standards‚Äù of the church and the new questions brought up and hidden away by scientific thought. But under the fabric of late Victorian society lay wide ranges of change; the increased marriage rate and idea of the domestic sphere for women giving way to the New Woman, the upper class vs. lower class divide giving way to a new middle class. With the growth of the economy came new ideas of English excellence; with the growth of scientific thought, scientific racism. 

Literature, as is usual, struggles to react. With a growing counterculture in literature came the reaction to such; at the trial of author Oscar Wilde, passages from his only novel were read to prove that he liked men. Soon after, Bram Stoker, formerly his acquaintance, began writing Dracula. 

The result is a book drenched in fear of the unknown: In xenophobia of the time, in homophobia, and in the anxieties that come when that who embodies both appears. That is what sticks with me, to this day, about Dracula.

What outstanding prose--prophetic, which is by far the most rare and inspiring of attributes a work of literature can ever possess. & Ray ""I Don't Talk Things, Sir. I Talk The Meaning Of Things"" Bradbury is here at his absolute best. I cannot decide whether this or ""Martian Chronicles"" is my favorite... they are definitely my favorite of his, the best possible possibly in ANY sci-fi adventure.

This is ""The Giver"" for adults. Here, another example of overpraised books that shockingly do live up to the hype. It's a resplendent petition for life, beauty, & literature; an AMEN for The Book's very core of existence... THE BOOK that actually worships other BOOKS (like The Bible does with God). Personal events and not the battlefields of Tolkien-sized scope (I mean small occurrences such as breakdowns, unpleasant jobs, below-par relationships...) tightens the razor-sharp string of terror; a severe lack of details is a tenacious and masterful way to portray this post-apocalyptic nightmare in the most disconcerting way. (If you're a lover of books, this seems like some Dantean form of poetic retribution!) 

""451"" is an example of when planets aligned just right and gave the writer a light for him to share. This, a writer's ""capacity for collecting metaphors"" is absolutely enthralling. I am wholly amazed!

A PLUS: read the edition with the 3 introductions by the inspiring Bradbury (there are 451 printings or so of this novel after all) & save a couple bucks in a creative writing class. His writing tips are genuinely far-out!"

Romanzo che mi √® parso molto, molto cinematografico (anche se non credo Fitzgerald avesse ancora incominciato a lavorare a Hollywood quando Gatsby fu pubblicato). 
Ma il cinema per gli US (e per noi italiani) √® la forma d‚Äôarte esportata meglio nel corso del Novecento, quella che si √® diffusa di pi√π, √® diventata pi√π famosa. Fitzgerald anche in questo seppe cogliere l‚Äôaria del tempo (e poi restare eterno come solo i classici possono).


Il primo adattamento per lo schermo apparve a un solo anno di distanza dalla prima pubblicazione, 1926, film muto, con Warner Baxter nel ruolo del titolo, Lois Wilson in Daisy, e Neil Hamilton in Nick. La regia di Herbert Brenon. Il film fu un fiasco, come tutti gli altri che seguirono nel tempo. Fitzgerald e sua moglie Zelda detestarono questo primo adattamento e uscirono dalla sala prima della fine della proiezione. Di questo film √® rimasto solo il trailer, il resto si √® dissolto.

Cinematografico non solo nell‚Äôattenzione alle luci: le finestre, aperte e chiuse, i controluce, i colori (il verde della luce del faro, il giallo della macchina e degli occhiali, il rosa e l‚Äôoro degli abiti di Gatsby, l‚Äôoro della ricchezza, l‚Äôazzurro dei prati, l‚Äôargento della luna‚Ä¶) - pure se all‚Äôepoca la pellicola era ancora in bianco e nero, la realt√† ricostruita nei set era ovviamente colorata. 
Squisitamente cinematografica la prima apparizione di Gatsby, in silhouette, uscito per decidere quanto gli spettasse del nostro cielo, protende il braccio verso la luce verde al di l√† della baia, il faro davanti alla casa di Daisy (questa luce verde ritorna pi√π volte nel romanzo, diventa il simbolo della ricerca di Gatsby, del sogno individuale e collettivo, infatti √® lo stesso verde che appare ai primi marinai che raggiunsero la costa americana, loro s√¨ inseguirono il sogno diretti da est a ovest).
Ma, l‚Äôeffettiva entrata in scena di Gatsby √® articolata in un crescendo, per i primi due capitoli e met√† del terzo, come l‚Äôingresso della primadonna. Preparata dalle voci (‚Ä¶√® parente del Kaiser‚Ä¶ ha ucciso un uomo‚Ä¶ √® cugino di secondo grado del diavolo‚Ä¶), dalle chiacchiere, dai mormorii, la curiosit√† sale nel protagonista io narrante e nel lettore (sicuramente nel sottoscritto lettore).
E poi, colpo di genio, Gatsby all‚Äôimprovviso √® gi√† in scena: niente occhio di bue, niente rullo di tamburi, accanto a Nick, il nostro Virgilio in questa divina tragedia americana, √® seduto un uomo di qualche anno pi√π grande di lui, che parla con cura e formalit√†, probabilmente un ex commilitone durante la Grande Guerra. Ed √® proprio lui, Gatsby, il mitico grande Gatsby, colui che dispensava la luce delle stelle a falene indifferenti.


Sempre in bianco e nero, ma in sonoro, si comincia a entrare nel mito, con Alan Ladd nella parte di Gatsby, Betty Field per Daisy, e Macdonald Carey che fa Nick. Dirige Elliott Nugent. √à il 1949, e anche questo film incassa male, la maledizione di Gatsby contagia lo schermo.

Esistono molti tipi di sorriso: quello di Gatsby per√≤ √® unico, e FSF lo descrive a meraviglia. 
Dimentica tuttavia di dirci la cosa che spiega tutto: non basta scrivere che era uno di quei rari sorrisi capaci di rassicurazione eterna, come si incontrano quattro o cinque volte nella vita - il sorriso di Gatsby era uno di quei sorrisi che ti fanno sentire importante. Prima di tutto proprio per il fatto che sia uno come Gatsby a sorriderti. Quel genere di sorriso che si accompagna quasi sempre a laconicit√†. Perch√© a quel sorriso si affida l‚Äôessenza della comunicazione.


Ed eccoci alla versione del 1974, con la star delle star, Robert Redford [che quest‚Äôanno ne fa ha 81, e quando lui non ci sar√† pi√π, per me non esister√† pi√π neanche Hollywood], Mia Farrow, Sam Waterston, Bruce Dern, Karen Black, Lois Chiles. Firma Jack Clayton, che rifiuta la sceneggiatura di Truman Capote e opta per quella di Francis Ford Coppola. Il film finalmente incassa, ma l‚Äôalchimia Redford-Farrow √® sotto zero. Clayton non raggiunge purtroppo le vette di The Innocents (in italiano: Suspense, 1961), l‚Äôadattamento di ‚ÄòGiro di vite‚Äô di Henry James.

Sempre per restare nell‚Äôambito cinematografico, Nick, l‚Äôio narrante √® al contempo regista e interprete/testimone, racconta ci√≤ che vede, assiste e partecipa, ma anche ci√≤ che ha sentito, ricostruendo l‚Äôintreccio per noi lettori come farebbe una voce fuori campo. 
Fitzgerald glielo lascia fare in modo che la storia e il personaggio principale siano costruiti su vuoti ed ellissi, elementi strutturali quanto mai filmici ‚Äì alcuni degli eventi fondamentali del romanzo non sono messi in scena, non sono rappresentati: per esempio, l‚Äôincontro tra Gatsby e Daisy, l‚Äôinvestimento di Myrtle, la morte di Gatsby, tutti momenti clou che rimangono per cos√¨ dire ‚Äòfuori campo‚Äô.
Nick √® il punto di vista dominante, ma √® qualcuno che ammette di essere allo stesso tempo dentro e fuori i fatti, √® qualcuno che ci dice esplicitamente quanto il suo racconto sia in soggettiva piuttosto che oggettivo - per questo non si trattiene dal manipolare il piano temporale dei fatti, l‚Äôordine degli eventi, spostandosi avanti e indietro nel tempo, proprio come farebbe un regista in fase di montaggio. 
E proprio come un regista che interviene sulla lente e gioca con la messa a fuoco, la percezione visiva di Nick √® spesso annebbiata, distorta, come sottolineano i molteplici riferimenti alla vista, allo sguardo, al punto di vista, all‚Äôillusione ottica (lo stesso passato di Gatsby riassume in s√© contorni sfumati e incerti). 
In contrapposizione allo sguardo del grande manifesto pubblicitario che ritorna pi√π volte, quello del dott. J.T. Eckleburg, che dietro i giganteschi occhiali nasconde quasi sicuramente gli occhi miopi di dio (metafora della cecit√† eterna, la pubblicit√† mercifica il divino).


Questa versione nasce modesta, destinata alla tv: √® il 2000, Toby Stephens interpreta Gatsby, Mira Sorvino Daisy e Paul Rudd Nick. Dirige Robert Markowitz.

Alla ricerca dell‚Äôultima frontiera, il confine da Ovest si √® spostato a Est, e in questa terra di conquista dove il sogno di felicit√† e redenzione √® universale ed eterno, in questa vicenda semplice, per certi versi addirittura banale, eppure complessa e intricata come solo i grandi classici possono essere, in queste pagine che sono simboliche e mitiche, americane al cento per cento (Under the Red, White, and Blue sembra che fosse il titolo preferito da Fitzgerald, lo propose all‚Äôeditore troppo tardi, l‚Äôopera era gi√† in stampa) ma universali, il sogno √® destinato a fallire. 
Gatsby √® un cavaliere medioevale senza armatura che insegue il suo sogno, il suo Santo Graal che si chiama Daisy, ma si chiama anche successo, perch√© senza successo Daisy non si trova, non arriva. 
Il sogno americano √® gi√† marcio negli anni Venti del Novecento, quando √® ambientato questo romanzo: il proibizionismo stimola e diffonde corruzione, il successo arriva in fretta con metodi spicci, non serve pi√π il duro lavoro. Anche se si arriva in cima, ci si muove in una terra desolata come quella che circonda il drugstore del marito di Myrtle, dove la donna viene travolta e uccisa, mischiando il suo sangue alla cenere, e in ultima analisi all‚Äôimmondizia. 
Proprio come Lancillotto, il pi√π celebre cavaliere medievale, Gatsby conosce l‚Äôamore sia romantico che fisico (non credo di aver mai letto una scena d‚Äôamore pi√π erotica di quella descritta da Chr√©tien de Troyes tra Lancillotto e Ginevra).

On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby‚Äôs house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn. 
Un esempio dell‚Äôincanto che √® una grande scrittura.


Nel 2002 ci fu uno strano tentativo, Gatsby diventa nero in questo insolito remake che trasporta la storia al terzo millennio: si intitola semplicemente G, dirige Christopher Scott Cherot, e Richard T.Jones interpreta il protagonista Summer G. Esperimento curioso, ma non indimenticabile.

Nel 1922, quando inizi√≤ a pensare al romanzo che ultim√≤ e fu pubblicato tre anni dopo, Fitzgerald scrisse al suo editor: Voglio scrivere qualcosa di nuovo - qualcosa di straordinario, di bello e semplice e dalla struttura intricata. Parole che sono cronaca di un capolavoro annunciato.
Figlio di Henry James, o come disse T.S.Eliot, il primo passo in avanti fatto dalla narrativa americana dai tempi di Henry James, mi piace pensare che Fitzgerald battezz√≤ la sua non eroina ispirandosi proprio alla Daisy Miller di James.
Figlio della grande tradizione, dove Nick sopravvive alla morte di Gatsby per raccontare la storia proprio come Ismael sopravvive alla tragedia di Achab, Fitzgerald seppe spostare l‚Äôasticella pi√π in alto, pi√π avanti. 
Cos√¨ in alto e cos√¨ avanti che un altro sommo scrittore, J.D. Salinger, fa pronunciare al suo incomparabile personaggio, Holden, catcher in the rye, parole di lode per Fitzgerald e il suo Gatsby (Mi fa impazzire, Il Grande Gatsby. Il vecchio Gatsby. Vecchio mio. Mi fa morire, capitolo 18). E come Nick alla fine del romanzo pulisce una parola oscena scritta sui gradini della villa di Gatsby, cos√¨ Holden cancella le oscenit√† scritte sui muri della scuola della sorellina.
A questo punto mi piace citare Calvino, le cui parole trovo particolarmente adatte a questo capolavoro: un classico √® un libro che non ha mai finito di dire quel che ha da dire - Di un classico ogni rilettura √® una lettura di scoperta come la prima - I classici sono libri che quanto pi√π si crede di conoscerli per sentito dire, tanto pi√π quando si leggono davvero si trovano nuovi, inaspettati, inediti - Un classico √® un'opera che provoca incessantemente un pulviscolo di discorsi critici su di s√©, ma continuamente se li scrolla di dosso‚Ä¶


Ed ecco l‚Äôultima leggenda, Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan in Daisy, e Tobey Maguire fa Nick. La regia √® affidata al geniale Baz Luhrmann. Siamo nel 2013. Il risultato non √® memorabile.

Tentai poi di pensare a Gatsby per un momento ma lui era gi√† troppo lontano.

Probabilmente non avevo diciotto anni quando ho letto Fitzgerald per la prima volta. I 28 racconti. Il primo, ‚ÄòIl diamante grosso come l‚ÄôHotel Ritz‚Äô, mi fulmin√≤ e mi conquist√≤ col suo finale: I don't know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That's a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it."" He shivered. ""Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night's full of chill and you'll get pneumonia. His was a great sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours. Chiarendo e stabilendo per me sin da allora che l‚Äôadolescenza non √® un periodo della vita, ma uno stato dell‚Äôanima."

so the government wants their citizens as fu**ed up as possible to let them better deal with life in general and absolutely not care about who is ruling over them. Best combined with flaming monogamy to stigmatize possible, alternative ways of finding happiness like love or a great, deep relationship with friends and family.

Media
All propaganda and forced into line, controlled by conglomerates and the military industrial complex with their sockpuppet politicians driveling manufacturing consent. But I began thinking about the fact that streaming and the incredible world of 4K and 8K old school media and VR is just the beginning and one can imagine how this might look in 100 or multi k years. People who are still free to choose will prefer the perfect, forever, simulated utopia to reality and many won¬¥t even have the chance to realize that they¬¥re manipulated or living in a kind of simulation, because the perfection of how the system is run leaves no room for bugs and glitches that could make them suspicious. That was a bit off topic, back to the show.

Not more or less of something that¬¥s essential for the perfect functioning of the world government that once was a single state.

Drugs, sex, media, and good upbringing together make good sheeps
All together leads to the happy slave tragedy, that people are completely satisfied with their life and not even noticing what¬¥s really going on.

I know, I know. I'm a peabrain pleb and this is truly a classic and how dare I?

I understand what it's trying to do. I understand the over-enthusiasm for science and the depersonalization. I understand how showing a thriving world devoid of relationships and emotions feels counterintuitive and wrong. ('That's the point!' I understand that's the part that's supposed to 'make you think!') I understand how the conditioning and predestination of this ""utopia"" sacrifices individuality for compliance and just whoaaaa

I even understand that the frickin orgies and the special drug (""Soma"") are representative of the way the people shed their own identities and continue to live a unified existence. 

I understand how ground-breaking this was. I understand it raises all sorts of questions and opens discussions about free will, societal control, the role of government and what humanity is.

But it's not for me. This is incredibly dense as the entire first half has been dedicated to showing the science and structure of this 'brave new world.' There's not really a plot and there's not really even characters? (I mean kinda?) It all feels dedicated to driving the same few points home.

I understand. But I'm bored. And I'm tired of the shock-factor of orgies and children engaging in ""erotic play"" 

(This really could have been a short-story and it would have accomplished the same things)"
644,Merna,The Secret Garden,"Feb 17, 2013",1,"1 star for a popular and beloved classic?
What a scandal.
Well, I think this is the first classic that I'm giving a 1 star for so it‚Äôs a fairly big deal.
Although I did not finish this, I already know how the book wraps up. (view spoiler)[Take a guess. Bratty kid. Mean uncle. Sick kid. (hide spoiler)]


Here's the thing:

Many classics deal with universal ideas. The Secret Garden deals with kids who have been neglected emotionally by their parents, and even though it's overdone now days, I can understand why it was so popular a century ago. I already know the character will have some self-realization about the fact that she‚Äôs a little bitchy, ungrateful kid (of course, she will still be racist), and she will live happily ever after with her uncle, never attending school because she‚Äôs a stupid female. ‚ÄúOh, she doesn‚Äôt need school, she needs to jump more rope!‚Äù 

I just can't connect with a story about a spoiled little rich kid who finds out that they can actually be nice, but it warms my heart to know everyone is capable of such emotion. 

 I also believe the message of the book was loud and clear: if you grow up in a environment like India instead of England then expect yourself to be a bad and mean person too. The message was not: be a nice person even if you're rich or don't be rude and bratty.

And if I have to read one more line of Martha talking, I'll lose it. Can the women speak properly? I don't care if it‚Äôs some accent. It‚Äôs goddamn annoying reading it. I also believe her brother was on meth because he would go around the field saying, ‚Äúahahaha canna tha‚Äô can you hears the birds and smell the honey‚Ä¶‚Äù

Classic? Please!

EDIT:  No need to point out to me that racism was the norm in the early 20th century. I held no illusion that was contrary to that. However, I also believe that it was not necessarily something everyone subscribed to even back then. There are people born far earlier than Frances Hodgeson Burnett and held far more progressive beliefs and were not so easily led by society to subscribe to such notions. What of men such as William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips after all?

Their code of morals were above a novel whose main purpose was to teach about morals. This is what essentially annoys about this novel. I don't care for the racism in other books. H.P Lovecraft's racism doesn't disturb me. After all, his stories weren't written to teach kids about morality or goodness.

It's the fact that this book is dedicated to correcting the behavior and morals of a child at every instance. However, when the child says, ""blacks are not people"" and no one bothers to contradict her then whatever message this book was attempting to deliver about morality is lost. 

The author is a ""product of her time."" Sorry, I didn't realize that you had to be born at a particular period of human history to see others of different appearance as human."

646,Merrin,The Giving Tree,"Aug 29, 2007",5,"Reading the other reviews on this book, I'm really surprised that there's such a level of hatred for this book. But then I thought everyone else in the world loved my fourth grade teacher too. We have to grow up sometime. 

I can't imagine not loving this book. I can imagine berating the attitude of the boy, of the tree, but I can't imagine not coming away from this book with a deeper understanding of human nature, of reciprocity, of a parent's love for a child and the nature of servanthood. 

Maybe too it's that I'm a Christian and can see a parallel between God and mankind. Maybe it's that I'm a daughter and can see the parallel between parent and child. Maybe it's that I'm environmentally aware and can see a parallel between the earth and humanity. There are so many layers to this book, so many different things to take from it. 

I've read other people say that the tree is wimpy, weak willed, allowing the boy to take everything he has without a word of protest. Can't you see that's the point? How much strength does it take to perfectly submit to someone else? To give everything of yourself to make them happy, to give them what they need. Would you fault your parents for not taking that Hawaiian cruise they wanted because you needed braces instead? 

I can see myself in the boy, can see the ways that I've taken from God, my parents, the earth, without a word of thanks, even a thought for what they have to give up for me. Does it make me angry? Sometimes. Does it make me sad? A lot of the time. Does it make me hate this book for pointing out the ways in which I fall short? Nope. I'm a big girl, I can take it."

looking back, im pretty sure this is the first book that got me to read outside my comfort zone. a friend had recommended it and i remember just thinking about how dumb it sounded. so i was shocked to find that i not only loved this, but i really looked forward to discussing the book with my friends and buddy reading the series together. this was honestly one of the first books/series that gave reading a social perspective for me.

now, ten years older, i can understand how this isnt written as well as it could have been, the characters are pretty shallow, and the romance in this is absurd. but the fact that this book still reminds me of why i love reading means it gets to keep its 5 star rating. and i dont feel guilty about that one bit.

And so begins our journey into Macondo, as Garc√≠a M√°rquez's words walk us through seven generations of the Buendia family, where time has come to a standstill, and the fate of every character seems to be written with an ink of tragedy.

Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez is a truly gifted storyteller, and his ability to find metaphors, to make fables out of the most mundane events in life with the charm of Scheherazade allows him a rare distinction of being one of the pioneers of magical realism.


Themes and Symbolism


The book has a plot sewn together with metaphors and rhetoric representing the story of Latin America as a whole.

Insomnia plague

Rebeca brings a mysterious insomnia plague to Macondo, causing loss of memory and sleep. The people of Macondo entertained themselves by telling each other the same nonsensical stories in repetition and everything in households having to be labeled, representing a metaphor for the story of Latin America being a repetition of its past and its cure at the hands of the sage represented its return to history, moving out of isolation.

Incest

The Buendias are shown to have a tendency towards incest, while their family always suffers from the fear of punishment in the form of the birth of a monstrous child with a pig's tail.

Gender roles

Throughout the novel, the men instigate chaos while the women strive to maintain order, sometimes in vain. Garc√≠a M√°rquez calls this a representation of the Latin American machismo.

The Glass City

The glass city is an image that comes to Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a in a dream. It is the reason for the location of the founding of Macondo, but it is also a symbol of the fate of Macondo.

Colors

Yellow and gold are two significant colors in Macondo's history. In Macondo, gold represents solitude and bad luck. When Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a discovers the formula for turning metals into gold and shows his son the result of his experiment, he says it looks like dog shit.

""Yellow is lucky but gold isn‚Äôt, nor the color gold. I identify gold with shit. I‚Äôve been rejecting shit since I was a child, so a psychoanalyst told me.""

- Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez in The Fragrance of the Guava by Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza

The Banana Massacre

The Banana massacre was a massacre of workers for the United Fruit Company that occurred between December 5 and 6, 1928 in the town of Ci√©naga near Santa Marta, Colombia. The strike began on November 12, 1928, when the workers ceased to perform labor if the company did not reach an agreement with them to grant them dignified working conditions. A fictional version of the massacre is depicted in the novel.

The Flood

The story has a biblical period of rain and flood, quite similar to the tale of Noah.

Borges

Some of the themes in the novel are obviously inspired by the works of Jorge Luis Borges. The Garden of Forking Paths, The Library of Babel and many more Borges stories have similar themes of inevitable and inescapable repetition in fictitious realms."
652,Tatiana,Ender's Game ,"Dec 11, 2009",2,"Hmmm, I find it hard to understand the level of following this particular book gets. 

Ender's Game is the type of sci-fi that doesn't interest me much. 225 pages about a boy playing video games, battling in zero gravity, and learning about how military works? I can work up some interest for these things, but there has to be some characters I care about. However, how exactly am I supposed to find compassion for a boy who goes from one task to another never failing and always being the best at EVERYTHING, and not because he works hard to achieve his greatness, but because he was genetically engineered to be the best? Where is the conflict and character growth here I wonder? And then the kids. I wish even one of the characters actually acted like a kid, or a human being at least. I personally only saw cardboard in every direction. 

I suppose there are some interesting ideas about military training, manipulation, and leadership, but I admit, I mostly found myself bored to death by numerous battles, which I couldn't visualize, and it's-so-hard-to-be-the-bestest-ever-genius whining.

Listening to the author's speech at the end of my audio book didn't endear me to him personally either. He is just not a very sophisticated person, but he surely knows his audience of prepubescent boys and gamers well. Plus I have very little respect for writers who create not because they have something important to say about our society and human condition, but because they are paid 5 cents per word to do it. 

I think I will stick with Ursula K. Le Guin for now, whenever I am in a mood for some alien action, and resign myself to the fact that Ender's Game's cult classic status is something I will never be able to understand. 

P.S. I did have a blast reading reviews about the author's obsession with naked, soap-lathered little boys. How they came up with this pedohomoerotic BS, I have no idea. Did we read the same book? 

P.P.S. I also had a blast reading Card's raging homophobic ""essays."""
653,jessica,City of Bones ,"Apr 18, 2019",3,"CAN YOU BELIEVE its taken me this long to finally pick up my first cassandra clare book?!? because i can. lifes too short to read books you know you wont love implicitly, but i recently had a change of heart. 

unfortunately, reading this went exactly how i thought it would. this is serving some major pre-teen juvenile cringe realness. the writing is a little bland. none of the characters are memorable. and there is a lot going on that isnt really worth obsessing over. 

that being said. i didnt hate this? it had its entertaining moments and i actually thought the pacing is pretty decent. i have seen many reviewers say that they didnt love this the first time around. i guess this is one of those books/stories that is more meaningful when reread, so that doesnt make me feel so bad for not loving this initially. maybe after i read the series, i will appreciate the series‚Äô humble beginnings much more. im willing to keep an open mind.

but for now, i will just leave here. i will most likely get around to picking up the sequel at some point, but i dont quite feel the rush.

George Orwell was recommend to me by his two most famous books:""ANIMAL FARM"" and ""1984"", and I had started reading ""ANIMAL FARM"" first by chance. 
Then I though that Orwell, almost, hadn't have something to talk about in his other book; because he ""has summarized up all what is happening in the occupied revolutions"". 
Later, I knew that ""1984"" was about Dystopian world that occurs after ANIMAL FARM's world. and Overall, the book was full of simple comprehensive metaphors, and reminded me of Bolshevik traitors comrades like Trotsky and Kautsky, LOL.

655,Bionic Jean,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jun 30, 2013",3,"The Time Traveller's Wife was published in 2003. It was Audrey Niffenegger's first novel, and is a surprisingly accomplished feat, involving a complicated time structure and alternating first-person perspectives. The two main characters, Henry and Clare, are introduced by way of a Prologue. The couple meet in a library in Chicago, but while Clare clearly knows Henry very well, and has done for a long time, Henry does not seem to know who she is. He is vaguely dazzled by this ""luminous creature"", who insists that she has known him since she was six years old ... at which time he was 43. 

Since Clare is now 20, and Henry is 28, this seems a confusing scenario for the reader. We gradually come to understand that this is because Henry has been travelling from his future to her past, and that in her past they had fallen in love. We understand that Henry hasn't actually yet met Clare in his own present. Henry, therefore is the time traveller, and Clare is his eponymous wife. This sets a pattern for the rest of the story, which largely follows Clare's life but is interspersed with some of Henry's time-travelling adventures. Audrey Niffenegger explains that Henry has been born with a genetic dysfunction, which she terms, ""chrono-displacement"".

The Time Traveller's Wife is divided into three parts. The first Book: ""The Man Out Of Time"", broadly covers Clare's growing understanding of the unique relationship she is to have with Henry. Clare has carefully kept a diary, which details all the future dates for Henry's visits, and she shows him this on almost their first meeting. The obvious result is that Henry feels rather overwhelmed and confused, and does not know what to make of it all, but also finds himself very attracted to Clare, her obvious passion and fervent loyalty. It also squares with his own experience and what he knows about himself.

Henry can remember the first time he time travelled, on his fifth birthday. He had enjoyed his first visit to a Museum of Natural History in Chicago so much, that later on he found that he had suddenly been pulled back there in time to the museum. The novel breaks the accepted rules of most time travel books at this point, (view spoiler)[by having young Henry meet an older, 24-year-old version of himself. The older Henry explains that he is a time traveller, but that it is a great secret. All through Henry's teenage years, the older Henry teaches him various tricks which he will need to know to survive, such as stealing, breaking and entering, and running from the police. (hide spoiler)]

A major shift in the narrative comes, as we next read a description of the event Clare has already referred to. We jump to the first time she as a 6-year-old met the 43-year-old Henry in a meadow, near her family's house on Lake Michigan. Henry had called out to Clare from behind a bush, where he was trying to conceal his naked self. Oddly, this apparently rather dubious situation comes across in the story as being rather sweet, with a very self-possessed young Clare, merely handing Henry her picnic blanket so he can cover himself up. 

The book follows her childhood and teenage years; her longing for a physical relationship with the 43-year-old Henry, since she knows that she will be with him in her future. We see her growing recognition that her peers think her strange, wondering why she is not interested in boys of her own age. 

(view spoiler)[A particularly poignant part of this first section is set at Christmas time. Clare has hidden Henry in the reading room of her parents' house. She knows that Henry hates Christmas, because he had told her that was when his mother died. On the morning of Christmas Eve, when Henry was six years old, both he and his mother had been involved in a car accident on their way to pick up his father. Henry managed to survive only because he had time travelled. Ever since that occasion he had been overcome with guilt for not being able to save his mother's life, travelling to the scene of her death over and over again, but helpless to do anything except watch the tragedy unfold. Henry thinks he should have died then too. (hide spoiler)]

However, the book has many comedic moments, since Henry can never take anything with him into the next world, not even his clothes. Usually he can name the date of his next trip, and Clare becomes used to arriving with clothes for him, but as the novel progresses there are more of the spontaneous shifts, where at any moment Henry finds himself sucked out of the present and thrown naked into another time and place.(view spoiler)[

One example is when Clare and Henry get married. With all their family and friends in attendance, Henry is whisked away without warning, just before the ceremony. But through a coincidence beloved of novelists, an older Henry shoots through the years to take his place. Oddly only the most observant of guests wonders about his suddenly grizzled appearance. (hide spoiler)]

The second Book: ""A Drop Of Blood in a Bowl of Milk"" begins with Henry and Clare's married life, which is marked by Henry's frequent absences and Clare's inevitable worries about him. (view spoiler)[She has begun to feel trapped and frustrated in their small apartment. Of course with the premise of the novel, Henry is able to buy a winning lottery ticket, which he duly does, they move into a larger place where Clare has a studio and can pursue her Art ventures, and all is hunky dory again. (hide spoiler)]

Audrey Niffenegger carefully explores the emotions of the couple, and it is interesting to the reader to observe the dynamics of their characters and relationship. The time travel element serves to highlight and sometimes resolve any cracks in the relationship. There is a point in the novel, for instance, where Clare is in her thirties, and Henry is 41. Their relationship is rather jaded, as Clare narrates,

""Henry's been gone for almost 24 hours now, and as usual I'm torn between thinking obsessively about when and where he might be and being pissed at him for not being here... I hear Henry whistling as he comes up the path through the garden, into the studio. He stomps the snow off his boots and shrugs off his coat. He's looking marvellous, really happy. My heart is racing and I take a wild guess: 'May 24, 1989?' 'Yes, oh yes,' Henry scoops me up, and swings me around. Now I'm laughing; we're both laughing.""

The reason for this,(view spoiler)[ as their present selves both know, is that Henry has been swept back to the date when he and Clare first made love, when Clare was just 18, before once again being pulled back into his present. And the recognition of this (hide spoiler)] mends the breach they are both feeling, and also serves to demonstrate to the reader a shift or dichotomy within any relationship, new or established, where one is feeling and experiencing different emotions from the other, at any one time.

This dichotomy then is the crux of the novel. One person's story is always going to be slightly different from another's, even when they are experiencing the same relationship.

The novel does have limitations. Its focus is really very narrow, even though the complexity of the time travel element does mean that the reader tends to give up on carefully following the chronology - the dates heading each chapter - and just go with the flow. But these two characters seem to be almost fanatically trying to have the conventional American dream of happy, ""normal"", domesticity, and in the end this begins to pall a little, to feel a little tired.

There is even an attempt in this middle section to give the fantasy element more validity, with the introduction of a new character, a Dr. Kendrick. With his assistance, Henry's involuntary time travel will later become known as ""Chrono-Impairment"". Sadly this plot development leads nowhere. (view spoiler)[The doctor says he won't be able to cure him, because this newly recognised disorder is too complex to work out and treat during Henry's lifetime. The condition does appear to be hereditary, which explains Clare's repeated miscarriages. The unborn babies seem to time travel, which means that Clare's body aborts them. There is a way around this however, again using the premise of time travel, and eventually Henry meets the child, Alba, whom they will have together in the future. He discovers that she has more control over her travels than he does, but also learns from her the imminent date of his death.  (hide spoiler)]

There is also a mysterious shooting accident in this part, plus a gruesome operation making Henry's ability to time travel very dangerous. Neither of these episodes I found terribly convincing. The accident seemed to be put in purely for the mystery element - to make the reader wonder at the reason for all the blood, to wonder if it was fatal - during a couple of time travel episodes. The unconnected medical operation merely seemed rather ludicrous.

The third Book: ""A Treatise on Longing"" is possibly the least satisfactory part of the novel. (view spoiler)[It describes Clare's life after Henry's death. Although a letter from Henry has urged Clare to move on with her life, she also learns from it that he had once travelled to her future, where he had seen her as an old woman. This makes Clare decide to wait for him. For many years Alba sees Henry on his visits, but he never visits Clare again, until she is 82 years old. (hide spoiler)] 

Although with this final section the ending is inevitable, and meant to be poignant, it comes across as rather sentimental and maudlin. Throughout the novel the reader knows that Henry and Clare's lives are already mapped out, and the time of their deaths already written. This impinges on the fantasy element rather too much. In fact it smacks a little of a spiritual religiosity - and one without free will. However, this is a very ambitious project for a first novel, and for much of the novel it translates onto the page with skill, an authentic believability, and a fair amount of charm. If there had been no time travel element, this would be a romantic novel, perhaps with a psychological focus, or a simple family saga. The domestic details here are more enjoyable because they add the necessary realism to the fantasy. Even though the relationship element is predominant, the fascination with the time travel element tends to enhance what might otherwise be a mundane if romantic story. Some of it works, some does not; some is rather mawkish. 

It is very possible that Audrey Niffenegger's best novel is yet to come. She has since written another novel, ""Her Fearful Symmetry"" and a balletic fable, for the Royal Opera House Ballet in London, in addition to her previous graphic novels. She is professor of creative writing at Columbia College, Chicago. It will be interesting to read the novel she is currently working on, ""The Chinchilla Girl in Exile"", and to see whether this novelist has grown in stature.

‚ÄúI won't ever leave you, even though you're always leaving me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted someone to love who would stay: stay and be there, always.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I'm dreaming you. Maybe you're dreaming me; maybe we only exist in each other's dreams and every morning when we wake up we forget all about each other.‚Äù"
656,Emily May,Les Mis√©rables,"Aug 15, 2012",5,"Les Mis√©rables can be translated from the French into ""The Miserable Ones"", ""The Wretched"", ""The Poor Ones"", ""The Wretched Poor"" or ""The Victims"". So, as you will have concluded, this is not a happy book.

In fact, it is the very opposite of fluffy happiness. It is a story about the lowest and darkest parts of French society in the first half of the nineteenth century. Hugo takes the reader on a 1200+ page journey around France and into the lives of criminals, prostitutes, those wasting away under the strain of poverty... and he provides food for thought on commonly-held ideas about the nature of law, justice, love, religion and politics. Not only this, but I can say that not one page of this giant bored me.


At the end of the day you're another day older 
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor


I feel the need to mention the musical of Les Mis√©rables (and I'm going to incorporate some lyrics into this review because why not?). It's one of my favourite musicals. The book is, as is often the case, a much deeper and well-developed version of the same story, but I still recognised many of my favourite scenes from the stage production. I had actually expected the book to be more gentle and subdued than the musical because of the time it was written and to avoid controversy - especially as Hugo's opinion of the French judicial system during this time was made very clear - but this was not the case. Les Mis√©rables is a nasty, gritty, haunting novel that doesn't fail to stay with you for a long time after putting it down.


I had a dream my life would be 
So different from this hell I'm living 
So different now from what it seemed 
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.


It seems wrong to try and simplify the amazing plot of Les Miserables but I have to somehow fit all that greatness into this little review space. So, the main plot line of this story is about the ex-convict, Jean Valjean, who has been released from prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and then trying to escape. He comes away from all those years doing hard labour with anger running in his veins-- what kind of society sends a man to that disgusting fate for trying to quell his hunger? His thoughts turn to revenge and rebellion; he no longer even wants to try playing by the rules of a country which has done this to him. Until he is shown an act of kindness beyond his imagination by someone who breaks the cycle of anger and vengeance.


Lovely ladies ready for the call 
Standing up or lying down or any way at all 
Bargain prices up against the wall


Taking the little money and the vast amount of kindness he has been given, Jean Valjean slowly becomes an honest (and wealthy) man who helps those in need. But his new found way of life and the respect he has earned becomes threatened one day when the police officer, Javert, starts to recognise him. But that is just one story being told here. 

Several stories run parallel to one another throughout this book and thye begin to entwine more and more as the novel progresses. Another is the story of Fantine and her illegitimate daughter - Cosette. Forced into prostitution in order to feed her child, Fantine is a woman who looks old for her age and no longer has the sparkle of joy in her eye that she enjoyed back when she was allowed to be naive. Cosette, meanwhile, is mistreated by the foster family who agree to take care of her while Fantine ""works"" in the nearby town. Other stories include that of Marius and Eponine, but there are many more.


The city goes to bed 
And I can live inside my head


The above lyrics are from one of the musical's best known songs - On My Own - and are sung by one of the most fascinating characters of the novel, Eponine. Eponine's tale is an old one, one of unrequited love but it is far from cheesy. Marius describes her as an ""unhappy soul"" and nothing can be much more accurate. She is a sad, complex, and unfortunate character, which I suppose they all are in Les Mis√©rables, but Eponine has a special place in my heart. But she is also far from weak. She has been toughened by life, made ugly by poverty, and she is ferociously independent. Yeah, I like her.


Here they talked of revolution 
Here it was they lit the flame 
Here they sang about tomorrow 
And tomorrow never came.


This book also chronicles the events leading up to and including the Paris uprising of 1832 and the novel includes themes of revolution. It is a deeply thoughtful story that challenged attitudes held at the time in many ways. To use one example: a court of law was ready to sentence an innocent man to life imprisonment because he was slow and uneducated and therefore couldn't speak eloquently in his defence. 

Perhaps this book is nothing more than an entertaining but dark story that Hugo wrote to grip and shock people, but to me this is a highly political novel that makes many statements about law and justice in France during the time period. I find it hard to dismiss Hugo's observations of the treatment of those who are poor and unintelligent as anything other than criticisms of society. But that is just me. I think I can say that you will be affected by this. Whether you will thank me for it or not, well, that depends on how easily you tolerate a depressing read. But I've saved my favourite and the most uplifting song for last:


Do you hear the people sing? 
Singing a song of angry men? 
It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again! 
When the beating of your heart 
Echoes the beating of the drums 
There is a life about to start when tomorrow comes!

WHEN A ROSE IS NOT A ROSE



It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.


I plan to read The Little Prince since many time ago, and I was aware that it was a quick reading, but still I hadn‚Äôt do it yet, until now.

I went to the cinema theaters and I watched the new animated film about it, and while I hadn‚Äôt read the book, I watched the film and I loved it. I was aware that it wasn‚Äôt an exact adaptation per se, and then I knew that it was about time to read the book. 

It was a quick reading, it took me like a couple of hours. Wonderful book.
The Little Prince is a metaphorical and surrealist journey where a rose isn‚Äôt necessarily a rose, a fox isn‚Äôt always a fox, a small planet isn‚Äôt a small planet all the time...

All those things and more that you can find in the book, they will be whatever you need to be. You just need to recognize what will be the rose, what will be the fox, what will be the small planet...

And then, and only then you will be able to realice the power behind of this cute little book.



HIDDEN THINGS



What makes the desert beautiful,... ...,is that somewhere it hides a well...


Also, a hidden wonder about this book is that you not only need to realice what things in your own life to interchange with the ones in the Little Prince‚Äôs journey, but moreover, you need to ‚Äúsee‚Äù with your heart and being able to find the ‚Äúwell‚Äù in every ‚Äúdesert‚Äù.

Sometimes isn‚Äôt easy, and I guess that there will be moments when those deserts are truly dry, maybe there was a well some time ago, but it‚Äôs long gone. But only you, if you are careful and ‚Äúobservant‚Äù with your heart, you will be able to make the difference.

At plain sight, your eyes can deceive you about what it‚Äôs in front of you, but if you learn to ‚Äúwatch‚Äù with your heart, rarely you will be fooled about it.

So, not matter if you are in a desert or a little planet (most likely an asteroid), be prepared to take flight and be ready with paper and a pencil, since who knows? Maybe the Little Prince will need you to draw something beyond the evident..."
658,Nataliya,Divergent ,"Jan 11, 2013",3,"Heh. I'm torn now. I eyerolled so much while reading this book that I may have permanently damaged at least some of my cranial nerves. And yet I read it in one sitting, annoyingly and inexplicably entertained. Go figure.


There just may have been some facepalming as well.

It's yet another young adult dystopia based on a stupid premise. Seriously, it's plainly ridiculous. If I had to compare it to something equally ridiculous it'd have to be the notion of sparkly vampires. I'm not kidding. Just listen to this:
""Decades ago our ancestors realized that it is not political ideology, religious belief, race, or nationalism that is to blame for a warring world. Rather, they determined that it was the fault of human personality - of humankind's inclination toward evil, in whatever form that is. They divided into factions that sought to eradicate those qualities they believed responsible for the world's disarray.""





How ridiculous is it? Well, it's a dystopian Chicago where, in an attempt to battle the evils of this world people came up with a BRILLIANT idea to segregate into five ""factions"", each of one is based on ONE quality that is supposed to be the uber-defining feature of them. Therefore we have the brave, the selfless, the smart, the truthful, and the kind.¬π Except some people can be more than one of those - the Divergent.¬π You know what this idea is missing? A Sorting Hat yelling out, ""GRYFFINDOR!!!"" as the character decides to make a choice and join the reckless brave. I eyerolled at it in a children's book where it made its appearance. I exasperatedly eyeroll at it now.No, really. That is stupid. First of all, how exactly will our society ever get to the point where such thing becomes plausible? (I mean, seriously - at least we can imagine the world of ""The Hunger Games"" happening given current obsession with reality shows.) And second of all, how exactly is everyone in this world NOT 'Divergent'? They have an option to switch factions after being raised in one; so basically it's okay to internalize the principles of more than one of them. How will that not make them 'Divergent'? So there's that, and the sheer impossibility of a person to live only within the rigid frames of one of the factions' principles.For instance, let's look at doctors, 'kay? In this book, they belong to the faction of the kind. Because, clearly, for this profession you don't need the smarts to learn medicine, the selflessness to sacrifice sleep and rest in favor of helping the sick, the bravery to cut into someone's bodily cavity, and the truthfulness to deliver bad news or admit when you don't know something. 

Clearly it would take a special brain to use more than one of these qualities not only simultaneously but EVER.

............................No wonder this world does not work well. Duh. I mean, how well does complete segregation work to create peace instead of creating new lines of division of ""Us vs. Them""??? Clearly complete segregation would do wonders to solve the violence-causing issues in the world. History showed us many examples of that. And I cannot believe that up until this point in that universe nobody questioned the validity of this structure.
""I think we‚Äôve made a mistake,"" he says softly. ""We‚Äôve all started to put down the virtues of the other factions in the process of bolstering our own. I don‚Äôt want to do that. I want to be brave, and selfless, and smart, and kind, and honest.""
Well, duh. Did it take centuries to come to this conclusion?

-------------
But here's the thing - once you put in the gargantuan effort to overlook this stupidity and suspend your disbelief to the point that it helplessly dangles over an abyss, this book is actually fun - despite all the faults, despite the shallow characters, despite the many elements so traditional to teen dystopias that you can't help but wonder whether they have been mass-manufactured.



It's probably the sheer amount of action in this book - nonstop action that makes action-heavy plot itself giddy from action overload. Did I mention action?

 Tris, the occasionally too-dumb-to-live protagonist¬π, does not ever seem to stop moving. Running, jumping, falling, fist-fighting, knife-fighting, shooting, running, punching - all that while she, a special Divergent snowflake, learns to fit in among the Dauntless, the Gryffindor-brave (read: stupidly reckless) faction of this universe.¬π (view spoiler)[Tris on purpose nonfatally shoots two bad guys (one of whom tried to actually rape her and kill her) - but kills one of her friends (who was mind-controlled via the actions of one of the aforementioned villains) on purpose, when a disabling shot would have worked just as well. And she shoots her friend AFTER she thinks she won points with God by not killing the villain.  (hide spoiler)]*eyeroll*
""Somewhere inside me is a merciful, forgiving person. Somewhere there is a girl who tries to understand what people are going through, who accepts that people do evil things and that desperation lead s them to darker places than they ever imagined. I swear she exists, and she hurts for the repentant boy I see in front of me. But if I saw her, I wouldn‚Äôt recognize her. ‚ÄúStay away from me,‚Äù I say quietly. My body feels rigid and cold, and I am not angry, I am not hurt, I am nothing. I say, my voice low, ‚ÄúNever come near me again.‚Äù Our eyes meet. His are dark and glassy. I am nothing. ‚ÄúIf you do, I swear to God I will kill you,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúYou coward.‚Äù

Yeah, don't piss off Tris. You may not be prepared for what's coming.

Yes, almost the entire book is the scenes of Tris training to become super-awesome, occasionally punctuated by the scenes of mandatory self-doubt. She kicks ass (literally) and she is loving it. Of course, in the way mandatory to all YA dystopias, her training just proves that this plain little average humble girl is the sexy badass that is better than anyone else at whatever she chooses to do, and somehow will be number one no matter what she does because she is, well, special.Because, it seems, ever since Rocky Balboa took the second place we have become accustomed to root for the seeming underdog - but that underdog now invariably turns out to be the winner of whatever competition there may be in the book - and the hottest male lead as a special prize.
Those rare times the underdog loses. This is not the case in this book. Duh.

And yet, annoying as these scenes are, they are still so much fun to read. Silly, shallow, mindless fun - the kind you get when you playing a fast-paced videogame, perhaps - but fun nevertheless. Yes, most of the action here is juvenile and seems pointless as a part of faction training - but hey, so is shooting up the heads of videogame aliens. But it's still entertaining.

So here's what I'm trying to say here: Suspend your disbelief, don't think too hard about what's happening, approach it as just fun - and you will be rewarded with a fun ride, like that giant rollercoaster in the amusement park that is worth it while you're on it (and slightly less worth it when you're puking up your lunch into a trashcan afterwards). 

Would I have given this book the GR Choice Awards? No, and I would not give one to 50 Shades of Grey either. And of course, my opinion is NEVER wrong, right?



But for the entertainment value alone I will give it 2.5 stars rounded up to 3. Still, I'm undecided whether I care enough about what happens to Tris to invest time into reading the sequel. 
------------
So I did read the sequel after all - and here is my review of it. 
And here is  the review for the final installment in the series, 'Allegiant'. Spoiler: these books get worse and worse."
659,Becky,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Oct 21, 2012",1,"I am not a romance reader by nature. That's not to say that I don't enjoy them from time to time, but I just don't usually gravitate toward romance. And to be completely honest, I had absolutely zero intention of reading this book, ever. But then it was chosen as my October Bookclub book, so my intentions just became irrelevant. 

So, now that I've read it... Umm... Well. I think that this book did have an interesting premise, and in another author's hands, could have been fantastic. But most of the time while reading this, I just kept feeling, well, manipulated and skeptical. All I kept thinking as I read this was how implausible it all was. And I'm not just talking about the time-travel.

Just to forewarn you, this long (really long) Ranty McRanter Review may contain spoilery stuff.

This book's description says ""[...]this is the remarkable story of Henry DeTamble, a dashing, adventuresome librarian who travels involuntarily through time, and Clare Abshire, an artist whose life takes a natural sequential course. Henry and Clare's passionate love affair endures across a sea of time and captures the two lovers in an impossibly romantic trap[...]"". 

Uh huh. 


""Impossibly romantic trap""? Well. A trap of some kind, anyway. 

My biggest issue here is that Clare's life has been entirely determined by Henry, with a little help from his unknown ally, the Catholic Church. Henry's told her what her life is and will be: She will be his wife. And because of her Catholic upbringing, the concept of predestination is not at all foreign to her (remember, God has a plan for us all), and so she accepts it as a matter of course. She sees him as her closest friend, the person who knows the most about her in the world, the person who loves her the most in the world, and as a young girl who is just starting to form ideas about romantic love, I'd imagine that to her he's like a God. An all-knowing (he knows her future) but mysterious (because he won't tell her about it, or anything about himself), unconditionally loving (I don't think I need to explain this one), metaphysical or supernatural being (time traveler, remember?), and who is just waiting for her to accept him (well, actually, just to get old enough to do so). I don't think it's much of a stretch, honestly. 

So, leaving aside the paradox of their relationship technically being impossible (they only meet in the present because of Henry telling her where they will while visiting Clare in the past), it strikes me as incredibly unfair to Clare that from 6 years old, when she meets a naked man claiming to be a time traveler in the meadow near her house, her life becomes tethered to Henry. Now, I can see a 6 year old accepting a story of a time traveler. A 6 year old's imagination is a wild thing, and children can accept and cope with concepts that would drive adults to drink. But as Clare gets older, and learns more about her life with Henry - that they are married, specifically - it becomes less and less plausible to me that someone would be able to accept that.

How does she know that he's not lying to her, or manipulating her into the life he claims she will live with him? She doesn't know anything at all about him other than the fact that he shows up naked in her yard repeatedly and claims to be her husband in the future. To me, the time travel itself isn't enough evidence. He could be a time traveler AND a liar. 

It just seems to me like a waste. A waste of a life that Clare could have had that would have been fulfilling and satisfying without Henry in it. Considering the fleeting nature of their relationship, and the massive extent of time she spent waiting for him, I just don't think it was worth it, and to me, Henry is incredibly selfish for pursuing that life for her.


The waiting is just endless... 

And here's where it gets confusing, because Henry believes that the past can't be changed to affect the future, right? So, 42 year old Henry meeting 6 year old Clare in the past leads to 28 year old Henry meeting 20 year old Clare in the present. It's destined because 42 year old Henry's past contains that meeting at 28. Right? 

But, Henry's theory is kind of crap because the whole thing is a paradox. He went to a past from a future that couldn't have existed UNLESS he changed the past in order to affect the future. 

And this is another reason why this book felt manipulate-y. I feel like we're not supposed to examine it in this way, and just read it for the love story and the heartbreaking sadness that this time-travel thing causes in the time traveler's wife's life. We're supposed to see this as an epic romance. We're supposed to see the relationship as the central focus, we're supposed to accept this at face value (as everyone accepts Henry's time travel and 20 years worth of him gallivanting around naked in the Newberry Library without losing his job, which is completely plausible, of course) and not give it too much thought, because if we look too closely, we can see there's not much there. 

Henry is described as something of a player by everyone but Clare. A cheater, a heartbreaker, emotionally unavailable... yet we never see this. Not one time. Ingrid (who we don't see with Henry in a Clareless present) is the bitter, devastated ex, and whatshername Celia? is the one trying to catch Ingrid on the rebound, so of course she's going to play up the Henry-the-Dog thing. But I don't buy it. Pics or it didn't happen, as they say. If you're going to claim someone's a player, you need to back it up - in real life and in fictional time travel stories. Show him time travel back and interrupt his younger self mid-affair. Then I'd believe it. 


Whoops!

Instead, all we see is Henry the Totally Devoted To Clare. He loves her more than love ever loved love and therefore they are DESTINED, and so it shall be. Henry knows what's going to happen, and therefore he doesn't even try. He just sits back and let's the future come to him. Kendrick's going to be his doctor because he is. It happens because it has already happened. So no need to get all rowdy and make an effort or anything. *Yawn*

In fact that's another thing. There's absolutely ZERO conflict in this book. None. Henry gets arrested for indecent exposure on a freeway in 1963? Conveniently he disappears before he's booked. Want something? Take it. Something's weird? Accepted. Family troubles? Just introduce your new wife, then all tension is gone. If there's a snag, it's always a momentary one, and it always works out in the end. UGH. Jeez! 

Anyway! Where was I? Oh yes, characters. Clare. She is... Well. This is going to be unpopular, but Clare is just an older, slightly (very slightly) less annoying version of Bella Swan. She has no life other than Henry. Her friends become his friends (because it's not like he has any of his own. Oh, wait, his old Korean babysitter counts, I guess). Her life is completely engrossed by his and there's no part of it that is Henryless. She's completely devoted to this guy who had to ship in an extra to appear at his own wedding because he's too unreliable to actually be there in present time. Just the kind of life every girl dreams of on their big day! :D


Oops, close, but not quite!

Supposedly Clare's an artist or something...? Yeah. Something like that. I guess. I live with an artist. And the art TAKES OVER EVERYTHING. There's art and art supplies and potential art supplies and scribbles and drawings and markers and paint and art... just... EVERYWHERE. It's not a hobby, it's a part of the Boy's LIFE. This creative need. So when Clare is described as making stuff like 3 times in the book, complete with step by step directions and an accompanying Create-It-Yourself! shopping list for the reader... it rings false with me. I don't see her as being an artist. I see her as being a toy that Henry picks up and plays with when he's around, and who sits on the shelf and waits for him to come back and play with her again when he's not around. And when it's convenient (aka: will reinforce the romance, like when she sketches Henry), Niffenegger sticks her in a studio with some art supplies and calls her an artist. That's not character development, that's just lazy. Oh but wait, you say, what about the bird sculptures? Oh right, those, how could I forget, because they were so massively important to the story that they were mentioned like one time. Henry's job is mentioned a bazillion times, and Clare's work mentions I could count on one hand. Lazy. For real. The book is called The Time Traveler's WIFE, why is there not more about Clare? Why is there not more TO Clare? 

And, speaking of shopping lists, seriously, I don't need an entire recipe recitation for each and every meal they eat. And the kinds of meals they eat are ridiculous. I don't believe that a 20 year old and her 2 punk-rock rebel anarchist roommates are drinking merlot and eating wild mushroom risotto. I can't even roll my eyes enough at that shit. But that's not even the best. I mean, Niffenegger's descriptions are insanely long anyway (the quality of the light glinting off of this or that, dew on the thinger I don't care about at all, the texture of the whatchamajig, blah blah blah) but at one point Henry is unpacking groceries and EVERY. SINGLE. ITEM. is listed before getting to the point of the list: a shocker item. THERE WERE 32 ITEMS. THIRTY-EFFING-TWO!! I counted. Unlike Clare, I am not fascinated by celery stalks and cans of creamed corn. So I gave approximately 0% of one shit about 31 of the items that were listed before the SHOCKER ITEM. Gah. Thirty-two. Seriously. 

Another thing that really bugged me were the miscarriages. There were times that they were written in such a way that I wasn't sure if it was a nightmare of Clare's or reality - I'm still not sure, but I think it was supposed to be reality. I admit to skimming quite a bit, so maybe I missed something. Blood-soaked sheets and bed, and a little tiny fetus breathing its last in her hand? What? Maybe Niffenegger isn't familiar with the stages of fetal development, but lungs are pretty much the last things to develop, so that's just... weird. 

But then finally, FINALLY Clare gets preggers, with her husband who is time travelling from the past. She cheated on her hubby with her hubby while in bed with her hubby, who is sleeping. But hey, that's OK. They are used to being in bed with each other, eh, 15 year old Henry and 15 year & 6 months old Henry? *elbow nudge*

Anyway... Toward the end of the book there are quite a few events that feel manipulative in order to cause a certain event. Henry's feet are important to him. This is drilled into the reader time and again. He runs because he needs to run when he time travels and lands somewhere buck-naked, raising all kinds of suspicions. So of course, something happens to his feet. Not just one, which would have had the same effect, likely, but BOTH. For the shock value. And to me, it was just not necessary at all. Because THE EVENT would probably have happened anyway - it happened in an eyeblink. And the repercussions from that event are... well. We're supposed to be crushed. 


I think this book is doing it wrong. 

I won't lie and say that I wasn't affected, though... but it wasn't because of the characters themselves. It was because I imagine myself in the position of losing someone I love, and know how heartbroken I'd have been. But then I get angry, because in the goodbye letter he leaves for her, the one in which he tells her to live her life and be happy, he mentions - just as an aside, you know!- that he visits her in the far flung future. And that leaves her waiting for him again... for 50+ years. How horribly selfish do you have to be to do that to someone? Is that a comfort? I don't think so. I think it's exactly the opposite. It's torture to make someone wait in uncertainty for over half their life for one brief momentary visit. 

Such a waste, and the more I think about this book, the more I find to dislike in it. It's not romantic, it's depraved. 

Yeah... so. I could go on, like about how the different perspectives were written and how even with the abrupt shift in POV I could never tell who was narrating unless I either checked or got lucky and one was talking directly to the other, because there was no difference in character voice at all, but the longer I do, the more annoyed I get, and I have better books I could be reading."
660,Sean Barrs,Nineteen Eighty-Four,"Jun 09, 2018",4,"‚ÄúThe best books... are those that tell you what you know already.‚Äù 

Just about everything Orwell says in 1984 is a maniacal truism. In some twisted form, everything reflects the truth of reality. 

Of course there are exaggerations, though nothing is far from plausibility. We are controlled by our governments, and often in ways we are not consciously aware of. Advertisements, marketing campaigns and political events are all designed for us to elicit a certain response and think in a desired way.

1984 takes this to the extreme. Cultural brainwashing becomes the chief goal. Assimilation into a passionless (and completely ignorant) mind-set becomes the most effective means of keeping the population down. If you can make a man forget (or deny) his past then he knows of no situation better than his current state: it‚Äôs all he knows, so why would he act to change it? Subjugation becomes normality. 


‚ÄúIf you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face‚Äîfor ever.‚Äù

Big brother does this by harsh policing, excessive surveillance and language manipulation. The streets are claustrophobic and the people (the workers) can escape nothing. Every action, every word spoken, is recorded. The police are ready to grab anyone who steps remotely out of line. Controlling language is perhaps the most effective thought control method I‚Äôve ever heard of. If language can be broken down into the absolute basics, the simplest and ordinary units, then people can only express themselves on a very minor level. They cannot think beyond their daily tasks because there are no words that connote dreams and fantasy. 

Step out of line and you are killed, though not before being dragged to room 101 for torture and even stronger methods of thought control. As such through the plot the book depicts a stark transformation, a transformation of man who was once willing to fight and to think but falls into one of the ingenious traps big brother sets for him to expose his criminality. Orwell‚Äôs words are frightening because of their eerie parallels with reality. He shows us that we are not so far from big brother as we may think. 


‚ÄúWe do not merely destroy our enemies; we change them.‚Äù

Unlike Animal Farm this also leaves much to the imagination. It‚Äôs a much more successful book and one that once it has been read, it certainly cannot be unread.

661,Kay,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Feb 02, 2018",4,"2022
I didn't think that I'll re-read this book but Lisa of Troy's read-along group has this book selected for May so why not? I listened mostly and have a book for reference. It's such a slow story but I think it works for this fictionalized memoir.

Memoirs of a Geisha follows Chiyo's life which begins in a small fishing village. She and her older sister, Satsu were taken from their parents with the promise of a better life (their mother is terminally ill). They were shortly sold, Satsu into prostitution and Chiyo to a geisha house. Chiyo became Sayuri and trained in various traditional arts and became an apprentice geisha (maiko). 

I'm not going to lie, this book has parts that made me very uncomfortable. The selling virginity to the highest bidder and having sugar daddy (danna). Bidding ceremonies and prostitution were outlawed in 1956. I try to remove my opinion and consider it part of history and old culture (pre and during WWII). It wasn't easy, but overall it's a good (difficult) story.

DNF. Bought this paperback for a long flight, but never finished it."
662,s.penkevich,Romeo and Juliet,"Sep 27, 2011",3,Fuckin‚Äô around and finding out in fair Verona.
663,Elle (ellexamines),The Catcher in the Rye,"Feb 02, 2017",5,"Holden Caulfield is a character many, many people hate. And trust me, I get it. He's a posturing hypocrite. He's a dick. I wanted to hit him in the face for at least a hundred pages. We know this. But he's a character that, for some strange reason, resonates with thousands of people. 

Why? 

Well, simply put, it's because he's written like this on purpose. But I think that doesn't quite get to the heart of it. Holden is a fifteen-year-old kid on the verge of an emotional breakdown. He's an asshole. He's a liar. He's a hypocrite. 

And he's also... really relatable. 

See, as a preteen, I struggled with severe emotional issues. I had depression and anxiety, although I didn't know it yet. I was going through major emotional issues with my parents, ones far worse than teen angst. I was on the lowest rung of the social pole at school. 

And God, I was an asshole. I was whiny and I was a hypocrite. I knew it, too, and I cried myself to sleep thinking about it. In the daylight, I told myself everyone else was terrible and that's why my world was falling apart. I was just as hypocritical and torn up inside as Holden is. 

Holden is an asshole, granted. But he is an asshole that it's hard not to relate to. 

So all this is to say that I completely understand why so many hated this book. But it resonates with me, and with so many people I know, for the exact reason that it will be polarizing. 

This is the kind of book that's going to be incredibly divisive. This is the kind of book that should maybe be taught by a teacher who loves it (thanks, 9th grade English teacher who hated me.) And this is the kind of book that sticks in my head, a year after I first read it. 

VERDICT: I really do recommend this, even knowing at least half its readership will despise it. It's truly worth the read."

666,Gothadh,Lord of the Flies,"Jun 01, 2007",1,"I absolutely hated this book. That's my over-riding memory of it I'm afraid. I had to read it in secondary school when I was about 12 and I never remember disliking a book so much which was surprising as I was a voracious reader.

I just remember having absolutely nothing in common with the characters - a group of English upper / middle class school boys whereas I was a Scottish working class girl. I just could not relate to the story at all and just wished they would all kill each other as soon as possible so the book would finish.

The fact that we had to read the book in class at the pace of some of the slower readers (agonisingly painfully slow readers) and then discuss it afterwards, which was like trying to get blood out of a stone, probably didn't help.

Never, ever again."
667,Kathy,The Catcher in the Rye,"Mar 25, 2008",2,"I read the end of The Catcher in the Rye the other day and found myself wanting to take Holden Caulfield by the collar and shake him really, really hard and shout at him to grow up. I suppose I've understood for some time now that The Catcher in the Rye -- a favorite of mine when I was sixteen -- was a favorite precisely because I was sixteen. At sixteen, I found Holden Caulfield's crisis profoundly moving; I admired his searing indictment of society, his acute understanding of human nature, his extraordinary sensitivity (I mean, come on, he had a nervous breakdown for God's sake, he had to be sensitive). At sixteen, I wanted to marry Holden Caulfield. At forty, I want to spank him. After all, Holden's indictment of society boils down to the ""insight"" that everybody is a phony. That's the kind of insight a sixteen year old considers deep. A forty year old of the grown-up variety recognizes Holden's insight as superficial and banal, indulging in the cheapest kind of adolescent posturing. It suggests a grasp of society and of human nature that's about as complex as an episode of Dawson's Creek. Holden and his adolescent peers typically behave as though the fate they have suffered (disillusionment and the end of innocence) is unique in human history. He can't see beyond the spectacle of his own disillusionment (and neither can J. D. Salinger); for all his painful self-consciousness, Holden Caulfield is not really self-aware. He can't see that he himself is a phony. 

Compare Salinger's novel of arrested development, for instance, with a real bildungsroman, Great Expectations. Holden Caulfield is an adolescent reflecting on childhood and adolescence; Pip Pirrip is an adult reflecting on childhood and adolescence. Holden Caulfield has the tunnel vision of teendom, and he depicts events with an immediacy and absorption in the experience that blocks out the broader context, the larger view. Pip Pirrip has the wonderful double vision of a sensitive adult recollecting the sensitive child he used to be; he conveys at the same time the child's compelling perspective and the adult's thoughtful revision of events. While Holden Caulfield litters his narrative with indignant exposes of phonies and frauds, Pip Pirrip skillfully concentrates on ""the spurious coin of his own make"" -- that is, without letting the child Pip and the adolescent Pip in on the joke, he exposes himself as a phony. Pip Pirrip grows up. Holden Caulfield has a nervous breakdown. 

I suppose the only reason I begrudge him his breakdown is that so many in our culture -- many more, unfortunately, than just the legitimate adolescents among us -- seem fixated on Holden as a symbol of honesty and socially-liberating rebellion. We view nervous collapse and dysfunction as a badge of honor, a sign -- to put it in Caulfieldian terms -- that we are discerning enough to see through all the crap. Our celebration of overwrought disaffection reminds me of the last sentence of Joyce‚Äôs Araby: ‚ÄúGazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.‚Äù Here is the adolescent pose non-pareil. Equally self-accusing and self-aggrandizing, it captures the adolescent at the precise moment when his own disillusionment becomes the object of his grandiose and self-dramatizing vision. That‚Äôs the kind of crap that Holden Caulfield (and J. D. Salinger) cannot see through. And it is often the kind of crap that we ‚Äúadults‚Äù like to slosh around in. 

The Barney beating of several years ago is another symptom of our arrested adolescence, our inability to ride the wave of disillusion into the relatively calm harbor of adulthood -- as though flailing around in the storm and raging at the wind were in themselves marks of distinction and a superior sensibility. I remember a news story about a woman in a Barney costume being seriously injured when a rabid (and probably drunken) anti-Barney fanatic attacked the big purple dinosaur at some public event. Now, I don‚Äôt know the age of the Barney-beater, but the act itself is a supremely adolescent one, in which the impulsive response to disillusionment is to lash out at those symbols of childhood which made the biggest dupes of us. At the dawn of adolescence, when Barney begins to appear cloying and false, it seems natural to want to beat up on him, as though it was Barney himself who pulled one over on us instead of our own poignant and necessary misapprehension of the nature of things. I could see Holden Caulfield beating up on Barney (at least rhetorically), and I could see Holden Caulfield missing Barney (as he misses all the ‚Äúphonies‚Äù at the end of the book), but I cannot see Holden Caulfield accepting the postlapsarian Barney on new terms, as a figure who is meant for children and not for him. For all his touching poses about wanting to be the ‚Äúcatcher in the rye,‚Äù what Holden really wants is not to save children but to be a child again."
668,J.G. Keely,The Da Vinci Code ,"May 13, 2007",1,"A thriller devoid of pacing or exciting language. A mystery devoid of clues, foreshadowing, or facts. A tell-all of half-truths based upon a forged document written by a schizophrenic conman. A character-driven modern novel devoid of character. The second draft of Angels and Demons. Page-turning action thanks to the literary equivalent of pulling out at the moment of orgasm. A spiritual awakening built on new-age conspiracy theory. This book is many things, and none of them good, new, or interesting. However, it is an excellent litmus test for idealistic delusion.

Upon the first reading, I must admit I found it a bit interesting, but then I turned the final page, and there was no bibliography. No explanation of how the author became familiar with all the concepts he claimed to 'faithfully portray'. He wrote this book and pretended it was a history book, and then refused to support it in any way. And any history you can't check up on is a bad one. 

He's no better than James Frey. In fact, he may be worse, since I know people who base their religious beliefs on this book, whereas Frey's only crime was wishing he was Scarface. And really, what macho thirtysomething male doesn't?

Brown had good reasons for hiding his sources: they were forged by con-man Pierre Plantard and snuck into the Bibliotheque National in Paris back in the seventies. And it's not like Plantard got away with it, either--the whole 'Priory of Sion' thing was debunked thirty years before this book was even written.

The artistic 'iconography' that figures heavily into the mystery is also completely made-up, and was declared ludicrous by an art history professor of my acquaintance. There are a lot of well-known symbols and allusions in classic art, but none of them resemble Brown's claims. The whole hinge on which the plot turns--the notion that an inverted triangle is automatically symbolic of women--makes about as much sense as declaring that the use of the swastika by 3rd century, BC Buddhists was proof that they were fascists.

The rest of Brown's book is filled with the sort of cliched religious conspiracies you get from your first year as a theology student. Not only that, but these conspiracies were already explored by better writers in 'Foucault's Pendulum' and the 'Illuminatus! Trilogy'.

Well, I've already done more legitimate historical research on this review than Brown did in his whole book, so I guess I'll call it a day."

In a world where almost every human trait is now considered a product of both nature and nurture, would Golding have written his tale differently today? No, I don't believe so.

674,Andy,Of Mice and Men,"Jan 27, 2008",5,"It's the way Steinbeck describes things that gets me.

""Crooks, the negro stable buck, had his bunk in the harness room; a little shed that leaned off the wall of the barn. On one side of the little room there was a square four-paned window, and on the other, a narrow plank door leading into the barn. Crooks' bunk was a long box filled with straw, on which his blankets were flung. On the wall by the window there were pegs on which hung broken harness in process of being mended; strips of new leather; and under the window itself a little bench for leather-working tools, curved knives and needles and balls of linen thread, and a small hand riveter. On pegs were also pieces of harness, a split collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out, a broken hame, and a trace chain with its leather covering split. Crooks had his apple box over his bunk, and in it a range of medicine bottles, both for himself and for the horses. There were cans of saddle soap and a drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the edge. And scattered about the floor were a number of personal possessions; for, being alone, Crooks could leave his things about, ad being a stable buck and a cripple, he was more permanent than the other men, and he had accumulated more possessions than he could carry on his back.""

None of this is relevant to the story, and yet a middle chapter opens up with this vivid scene. Steinbeck succeeds because the characters he paints in your head are exact. The first time I saw the movie that was made out of this story, it was just as I had envisioned it. Though the story great itself, the reason I will come back to this book is for the little things, the very things that have made me love Steinbeck so much. 

I first read Of Mice And Men my sophomore year of high school, when it was a required reading in Mrs. Beeler's class. I recall disliking almost all required school readings up to this point (though admittedly I had skipped out on the summer reading project of ""The Grapes Of Wrath""). When this book was assigned, I knew it was different. I blew through it, reading it in a day or two, even though I wasn't supposed to. For once there was a school book that I enjoyed. And all the credit in the world to my teacher, who chose other good books the rest of the year. So it's been 6-7 years since I've read this, and now, reading it for the second time, it's just as memorable as I remember. The story sticks with you, the imagery sticks. The characters are among Steinbeck's best, painted in such a crystal clear vision of the time.

It's a near perfect short story, and one that I will surely revisit throughout my life."
675,Wil Wheaton,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Apr 14, 2014",5,"As wonderful and magical as promised. Because I didn't remember the movie, the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me.

I wish I'd had this book when I was a kid, because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it, and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me.

Anne's finishing this, too, and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book ... HURRY UP ANNE!"
676,Maureen,Anne of Green Gables,"Oct 19, 2015",5,"""Dear old world,"" she murmured, ""you are very lovely and I am glad to be alive in you.""

This quote really accurately depicts how Anne lives her life and what makes you love her as a character. She's stubborn and makes mistakes, but she also has a huge imagination and sees the world as beautiful and full of possibilities.
I loved this SO much and I'm sad I never read it before! I love all the characters and the plot, and it's really fun to see Anne grow up through this book. The writing is also really really lovely.
I can't wait to read the sequels and follow Anne's story! 
This has made it up to my favorite books of all time list, that's for sure.

I'm not gonna review how exquisite John Green can write, or how he can create characters as special as Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, or how amazing he can tell a story. Despite the huge number of ratings and the spectacular average rating, this book is not perfect. You might find it unrealistic, because if there are many of us who see the life and its complexity like Hazel and Gus do, this world will be such a happy place. So like any other book, this one also might be a miss or a hit. If it's a miss, then you can say it's not worth the hype. But if it's a hit, it hits hard.

Everyone grew up with Harry Potter. They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films. They would re-watch and re-read them. They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP fandom, about loving every character and instantly missing the world. Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones.

Except me. 

I didn't grow up with Harry Potter. Not because I didn't get to, but because I chose not to. I know, it's like living a life where everything has been a lie. Worse even. It's just, the movies would appear on my tv. From the first one, to the next and the next, and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one, I wouldn't be interested and would skip it when I came to it. I wouldn't bother and wouldn't care, and that made a big problem in my life now. Here I am now, being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7, 8, 9, and older until now. But now, as 2016 and having over 500 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films. Now, here I am, wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much, missed too much, and have been missing too much. I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is, and how special it already has become.


There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.


Harry Potter is one of the most famous, loved, and top series out there. It is loved, adored, cherished, and amazing for HP fans every time they read it. No matter how many times it is read, it fills the person's heart with warmth and happiness, as they are going back to the wizarding world. As for me, I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this, because I am new to this all.
Other than that, Harry Potter is considered a Children's book but in my opinion, it's in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some. Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand, I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names. 

Harry Potter, a story about a young wizard that didn't even know he was a wizard. Harry Potter, a 10 year-old boy, who turned 11, is living with his horrible, rude and awful ""family"", The Dursleys. Mrs. Dursley is known as Harry Potter's mother's sister. The problem is, they didn't like each other, nor blend in with each other. They were different. Her sister was a witch, while she was just a Muggle, a person who cannot seek the magic and find it, nothing and no one special because they aren't able to turn things into other things, aren't able to fly on a broom, cast a robe on fire, defeat a villain, confuse a troll, aren't able to do anything, really. 

The reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore, known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry was a baby, his parents were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who but as he tried killing Harry, he really wasn't able to. His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him, but as he tried killing Harry, he couldn't bare to do it and left him a scar, the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person. Once saved and taken, the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys, and as Harry grows, they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies. Except they don't.

As days pass, Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesn't know. He doesn't know who it is and what they want, but he knows there is something going on, due to the amount of letters being sent. After getting the chance to open the first one, his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him, read it, and burn it. He knows, he knows who it is and what they want, but he doesn't want Harry to know. But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all, letters keep arriving and arriving, until the person finally shows up face-to-face with The Dursleys and Harry on his 11th birthday.

He's huge, introduced as a half-giant and half-human, known as Rubeus Hagrid. Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth, telling him he is a wizard, and a well-known one as well. He's got talent, and has some of the same abilities as his parents. One being a witch and the other being a wizard, Harry is known as a wizard as well. And as Hagrid tells him the truth, Harry does too. He doesn't know what he is talking about and doesn't know what is going on. He doesn't believe he is a wizard, and doesn't believe the reason for his parent's deaths. But of course, Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash, for that seemed impossible, but they were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who and is the reason for his scar.

When Harry leaves with Hagrid, they go and buy him what he needs, including clothes and supplies for the school. As they go to the shop, he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else. Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand. He's famous, his name is everywhere, and he can be considered a legend for what happened. But even with all this going on, Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out. As Harry and Hagrid get what they need, it's time for Harry to go to school, where he meets Ron Weasley, as to what I know, one of his best friends. Ron is small, red-haired, has freckles, pale, and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him. He's not accepted into the other groups, and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend. Harry also meets Hermione Granger, known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be. Of course, they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school, so I was just like ""we get it."" 

Days pass, and Harry is being trained. He's a neutral to broom-stick flying, is able to play Quidditch, the most popular game in Hogwarts, is given special supplies, and is of course, known by everyone. Other than that, Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths, but in order to do that, he must find a way to find them and figure them out. With the help of his two friends, he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard, more about his parents, history about himself, who this ""You-Know-Who"" person is, remember his past, and see how his life really will be changed, forever.


Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.


Harry Potter was easy to read, understand, and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it 5 stars. Now, I hate myself once again and ask myself, again, ""Why did I not read this earlier?"" The answer is obvious, because I already know it and it's because I was never a fan of it. I hate speaking about my past, but this is one ugly past and I hate it. I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it. But soon I'll get over it and will be able to re-read this as many times as I will be able to during my last 3 years of being a teen. Yes, a 15 year-old that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young. PATHETIC.

The fantasy is cute, I will say. It's easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through. It's not long, it's not hard, and it's not boring. It's gripping, fun, and everything is filled with some kind of magical element that has me turning page by page. Having no regrets anywhere, I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards, where students learn how to make potions, talk to ghosts, learn about other creatures, transform things into other things, read minds, become invisible, fly in the air with a broomstick, play soccer in the air, have a feast and enjoy it all, learn magic, have a wand, and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses. Well, I guess in most.

Everything was fun to read. I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life. He was confused, but he found out a lot more. There's still more, but I know that as he grows, I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how. I'll see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness'. I'll be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes. I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think. I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger. I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy. But more importantly, I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like I'm on an adventure. Reading it for the first time feels like one. I've never watched the films. I've watched parts, but skipped them. Now, I won't skip anything. It's like an adventure where I'm dived in and can't seem to leave because I'm so alive and intrigued.

What can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said? Nothing. Reviews are always similar, and this one might be too. Everyone loves it, and so did I. Yes, I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed. But nothing was boring, and even when I rolled my eyes, there was a reason for that eye rolling scene. Maybe it was Hermione being annoying, or Draco being a rude boy, mocking an adorable red-haired. Or both. But I was also laughing. I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid. Since the beginning, I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious. I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig. I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly, but that's okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times. Oh and also, Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys, I love him. He's so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry. I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry. He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as 11, bring him a present and giving him another one at the end. 

Ron is honestly the cutest. I don't understand how anyone could be mean to him. He may be weak, but he has his own strengths. He's so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him. There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it, but I'll probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know he's still gonna be really mean throughout the series. I'm sure. I haven't spoiled myself, so I have no idea how his or anyone else's life goes, but I do know that he changes in some way. Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well, but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy. She hated losing points for her house and because she, Ron, and Harry were in the same house, they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor. She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments, but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with her.

The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites. I know it didn't work out at first and they honestly hated her, but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle. Thanks to the troll, she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them. She didn't yell at them for fighting the troll, but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again. As it was ending, she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldn't really figure out what to say. But also, my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning. It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends, and it just made me happy seeing them all together, same house, same team, same classes. 

The writing of course is, like I said, easy to understand. There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded, and there were no problems. I didn't know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies, but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences. I hear they are kind of the same, just that the book provides some more information and detail. Like always, it's no surprise. 


There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.


Overall, I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with, now wanting the 2nd and the 3rd and the rest. Really excited to see where this all goes to, and how Harry becomes a better wizard."
681,Lyn,The Alchemist,"Aug 29, 2016",3,"This is either a beautifully written and fable-like illustration of simple and universal truths or a load of crap.

I have a bad feeling it‚Äôs the later, but then I consider that there could also be a third option.

I read once that Sting, when he wrote the classic Police song Every Breath You Take, mixed up a series of banal clich√©s about love and loss and just put them all together, and so this cool tune has some satire about it. Similarly, the Credence Clearwater Revival song Looking Out My Backdoor, a clunky but loveable country western tune, was actually begun as a facetious parody of slide guitar yokel lyricism. 

I also think of the comedy / performance art of Andy Kaufman and the constant, uncomfortable tension about what he was doing and why. Was it really so bad it was funny? If it was so obviously corny and insincere, was that not funny? Or was it? Was he really wrestling women and then getting beaten up by Jerry Lawler? That was a joke right?

So ...

Was Paulo Coelho‚Äôs 1988 fantasy / magical realism parable of truths found in nature and subtle messages from God told straight or was there a wink and a nod told with some fun?

Now ‚Ä¶ think about it for a second. The whole ‚Äúlost gold‚Äù theme and the discussions with the alchemist about a supposed elixir of life and ‚Äúfollow your heart‚Äù rhetoric. Was Coelho telling this straight or pulling our leg?

I have to say that I doubt it, but I did laugh a few times and the over the top syrupy delivery made me wonder, and maybe I liked it better considering this twinkle of a third possibility.

I will say that this could go either way. I can absolutely see where someone could find hidden treasure and deeply meaningful messages in the short novel. And I can see someone rolling their eyes and sticking their finger down their throat in a gag gesture.

I‚Äôll cast a Cheshire cat smirk and like for another reason."

But this book deserves a thousand splendid stars- it is a true masterpiece and a wonderful book!

""Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. You remember that, Mariam.""

This story chronicles 30 years of Afghan history; from Soviet invasion, to the Taliban, to post-Taliban. This story is told from the perspective of two women; born a generation apart, with different ideas of love and family, two very different childhoods, they are bought together by loss and by war. This story shows both the dangers that Mariam and Laila face- on the streets of Kabul and in the home. This story shows the important bond of friendship, and how strong this is especially when faced with difficult decisions or scenarios, and how this bond of love will effect the next generation.

""Where I come from, one wrong look... and blood is spilled. Where I come from, a woman's face is her husband's business only I want you to remember that.""

My heart bled for Mariam's childhood. She held little freedom and was sheltered from most of the outside world. She knew very few people as well and had a mother who refused help for a mental illness (labeling it as the jinn taking over her body). Mariam had little luxuries and was denied an education by those around her... These exact things that most of us take for-granted. 

On the other hand, Laila had siblings and a father that absolutely adored her. She also had friends her own age with whom she truly cherished, and had the privilege of an education.

However, both women's lives are brought together through tumultuous events, leading them to both have the same fate and live in a very unhappy household, where abuse and violence takes place at the hands of their controlling husband, Rasheed.

Laila never would have believed that a human body could withstand this much beating, this viciously, this regularly, and keep functioning.

The level of control and subordination of these women shocked me. Reading parts of this book left a stale taste in my mouth over the abuse and learned helplessness these women face.

Singing is forbidden. Dancing is forbidden. Attention women: You will stay inside your homes at all times.. if you go outside you must be accompanied by a male relative. You will not, under any circumstance show your face.... Girls are forbidden from attending school. All schools for girls will be closed immediately.

Hosseini does a fantastic job at describing the rules that both men and women face under Taliban rule, and Shari'a law. It's almost hard to believe the inequality and the restriction of freedom the women in this story faced- it made me feel like my stomach had plummeted to my feet... It also made me incredibly angry, my fists curling on more than one occasion. 

On the whole, this book is extremely thought-provoking and not easy to digest, however, it also inflames the human body with emotion; heart-breaking, heart-clenching and the story hits you like punches to the gut. This book will resonate with some people who have lived through war-torn countries or under the terrifying Taliban rule, or, as in my case, it will be a learning experience. For example, learning Afghan history and the shifts in the treatment of women culturally. It also makes the reader consider their own privilege compared to the stories of both Laila and Mariam. 

I think the most stunning thing about this novel is that whilst Mariam and Laila are fictional characters, it applies to so many women out there (for example, around 65 million girls globally are not in school). Hosseini may be writing fictional characters, but these are the stories of an army of resilient and brave women who have lived and breathed this life. He makes the reader aware.

This book provided devastation and loss, as well as hope and love and beauty. Hosseini approaches the plot in a very realistic way and it is written beautifully. This is an unforgettable read for me and the stories of Laila and Mariam will stay with me for a while.

One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,
Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls."

For instance, if all the others would still age while one stays young. From a sociopathic or dark empath perspective, this wouldn¬¥t seem that bad. One should probably camouflage oneself with makeup to seemingly age, to not let others get too suspicious regarding bathing in the blood of virgins that wasn¬¥t extracted by harmless and consensual blood donations, selling one's soul to the devil, and sacrificing humans to the flying spaghetti monster or whatever one is into fetishizing to get kinky style aroused. Without proper aging style, this could lead to
 
Envious people ruining a show that could go on for a very long time
If this would be the only front, it could be easy to handle. But of course, poor, weak ephemeral flesh embedded, human minds, souls, and other questionable and theoretical constructs, just can¬¥t handle the pressure of seeing the manifestations of one's true age in a not so flattering painting. Then paranoia and other mental issues kick in and the whole thing tends to go

First Reading

I am FINALLY getting around to reading this series. 



I thought the movies were okay, I do wish they would remake them and make them better, like the books =) 

Poor Percy. 

Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood. 
If you're reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close the book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life. 

Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful, nasty ways. 

If you're a normal kid, reading this because you think it's fiction, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened. 

But if you recognize yourself in these pages-if you feel something stirring inside-top reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before they sense it too, and they'll come for you. 

Don't say I didn't warn you. 

My name is Percy Jackson.

Most people already know the story of Percy Jackson and how he found out he was a half-blood. How he ended up in a half-blood camp (almost didn't) How he beat a Minotaur and later on, many things. 

I thought it was a fun read and I loved all of the different mythical creatures! That was so wicked cool! 

Percy makes some good friends in the camp and they go with him to do a quest. He has been blamed for stealing something from Zeus, which he did not, so they have to set out to find who really did it. Other wise there is going to be some knock down drag out with Zeus and Percy's father (Poseidon) and others of course. 

So they set out on this quest. 



They have to go have a little chat with Hades <-- fun times. They get attacked by many creatures of all shapes and sizes. They also get help from certain creatures and a pink poodle named Gladiola who ran away from home and doesn't want to go back but does so the kids can have some reward money. Wasn't that sweet! 



‚Üë Can you blame little Gladiola? I mean I love the color pink, but NO, JUST NO! 

Anyhoo, I did want to smack the group a few times because of stupid things, but who doesn't do those from time to time. *raises hand* I loved when they saved the animals in the old truck they were riding in, Grover is awesome! 

I look forward to reading ALL of the other 50 billion books in this ongoing Rick Riordan world! ‚ô•

688,zainab,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,"Dec 01, 2022",4,"Alice suddenly falls into a hole and sees an empty corridor, where she is, she does not know. Often she does not know if she is herself or maybe someone else? In her dreams, Alice encounters many strange kings and queens, talking animals, a hatter, playing cards, a chessboard and many other strange creatures. It is a fable wrapped in a fairy tale. The book includes many beautiful drawings and makes the story more vivid. It is quite confusing at times, but that is what makes the story this adventure."
689,Julie,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Apr 10, 2008",2,"** spoiler alert **
           I finally got around to reading these all the way through. I'm pretty sure I read through book 4 when I was much younger, but really, it was a different experience reading them as a twenty-something. I vividly remember the moment several years ago when my mother and I were watching a televised version of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe... and suddenly made the connection that the whole thing was a giant allegory with Aslan as Jesus. We just looked at each other going, gee, this is sounding very familiar all of a sudden. Well, if you think that particular book smacks you across the face with Christian metaphors (and obviously as a small child I didn't pick up on this at all), wait til you hit some of the later books (especially The Last Battle).

The end of the series completely shocked me. I understand the whole thing was a Christian allegory to begin with, but HOLY COW. I will try not to spoil it here, but... it's vaguely creepy to see how enthusiastic they are, and also horrible to think that Susan is now left behind. I did read that Susan's fate is meant to be an example, that rather than showing that she is now damned/unable to someday go to New Narnia, her fate is left open‚Äîif she repents and returns to believing in Aslan, and asks him for forgiveness, she will be able to join her family. Still creepy and shocking though.

You can also see in A Horse and His Boy how harshly Lewis contrasts the Calormenes with the Narnians. The Calormenes are repeatedly referred to as ""dark,"" ""smelling of garlic and onions,"" with ""curved swords..."" he even says their poetry is far inferior to the Narnians'. The picture he is trying to paint here is painfully obvious, as all the Calormenes' culture reflects that of the Middle East (whereas the Narnians are obviously very similar to medieval England). It's a seriously bigoted world view, one that I'm sure was more acceptable at the time the books were written, but now is rather jarring to read.

I did enjoy reading these books. I'd thought them awfully dry the first time through‚Äîstuffy English children in a fairly entertaining magical land, etc... The difference this time was, I watched the 2005 movie first. The movie completely blew me away, and while reading the first book (and even the succeeding books which involve the Pevensie children) I was able to imagine those warm, courageous and yet flawed children in place of the stuffy English ones, and it added a wonderful new dimension to the story. It was enough to carry me through the boks I didn't like as much, and made me enjoy my favorites even more (those would be The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Horse and His Boy).

Overall, I'd recommend them (they're a super-quick read too, you could probably finish one in a single day if you tried), but only after viewing the 2005 film first. :D Can't wait til movie #2!"
690,Alex,Fahrenheit 451,"Dec 29, 2012",1,"""The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.""That is a very unpleasant metaphor, and Fahrenheit 451 is an unpleasant book. It feels like it was written by a teenager, and if I were his teacher I'd give it a B- and not let my daughter date the weird little kid who wrote it.

Its protagonist, Montag, lacks any character; he changes as Bradbury's shitty story requires him to, from the dumbest kid in the world (his cousin once offered to pay him a dime to fill a sieve with sand and he sat there for ages crying and dumping sand into it - I understand that's a metaphor, but it's a metaphor for a dipshit) to a mastermind (telling Faber how to throw the Hound off his scent). You ever see film of someone skipping a pebble in reverse? Me neither, but I bet it's like this: plop plop skip skip wtf?

Each other character exists solely to advance the plot. There's the hot underage Manic Pixie Dream Girl - ""her face fragile milk crystal"" - who teaches him how to smell dandelions (and whose beauty is harped on endlessly) and then disappears off-stage; Faber, who's all of a sudden like best friends and then disappears off-stage; the bonfire circle of retired professors who happen to be right there when he stumbles out of a river looking for them.

There's his wife - ""thin as a praying mantis from dieting, and her flesh like white bacon."" He seems to loathe her, and all real women.
""Millie? Does the White Clown love you?""
No answer.
""Millie, does - "" He licked his lips. ""Does your 'family' [TV entertainment] love you, love you very much, love you with all their heart and soul, Millie?""
He felt her blinking slowly at the back of his neck. ""Why'd you ask a silly question like that?""There's a real conservative streak to this book. It looks backwards, as conservatives do. Bradbury blames his world's disgust with books on ""minorities,"" what we nowadays call ""special interest groups"":
""Colored people don't like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people don't feel good about Uncle Tom's Cabin. Burn it.""These are the only specific examples given during Captain Beatty's central speech about why literature has been banned.

There are some nice moments here. A disturbed and immature but intelligent kid flailing around will hit a few marks. The central idea? No, no props for that; book-burning was invented centuries ago. But the moment when the TV instructs all citizens to open their doors and look for Montag, that's nice. And the suicidal Captain Beatty is the book's only living character, although his speech is littered with what I swear are just random quotes. I even like the idea of a circle of book-readers, each responsible for remembering a certain book - but it's dealt with so lamely here. ""We've invented ways for you to remember everything you've ever read, so it's no problem."" Well, in that case I got like half the Canon, y'all can go home. Losers. Wouldn't it be cooler if these people had to work for it? 

Point is, those little flashes of competence are so overwhelmed by terrible philosophy and so ill-sketched themselves that I have no idea how this book has escaped the bonfire of apathy, the worst and most blameless fire of all. It's just a lame, lame book. 

 I wouldn't burn this or any book. But I'll do worse: I'll forget all about it."
691,s.penkevich,Crime and Punishment,"Sep 24, 2011",5,"‚ÄòTo go wrong in one's own way is better then to go right in someone else's.‚Äô

I have been giving a lot of thought to this novel lately. Despite the three years* that have gone by since reading Crime and Punishment‚Äîthree years in which I‚Äôve read some outstanding literature, joined Goodreads and written just over 100 reviews of the books I‚Äôve journeyed through‚ÄîDostoevsky‚Äôs novel still resides on it‚Äôs throne as my personal favorite novel. No other web of words, brushstrokes or music melody has ever struck me so deeply and consumed me so completely as this book did. The author‚Äôs collection of works as a whole has left such a mark on my soul that I felt it necessary to permanently affix his likeness on my arm. Over a century has passed since its initial publication, yet Dostoevsky‚Äôs message is still as poignant today as it was when it was first inked onto paper. Crime and Punishment features an immensely engaging blend of intrigue; philosophy; political, social, moral and religious commentary, that all thread together to create a masterpiece of literature that captures the deep, raw core of the human condition when it is at it‚Äôs most gruesome and vulnerable. The exquisite literary genius of the novel evoked a strong emotional resonance in me and the timing of my reading was just right to forever wed me to my love of books.

Initially envisioned as two separate novels, one following the inner turmoil of a murderer and the other chronicling the melancholic destruction of a family due to a flighty, alcoholic patriarch, Dostoevsky deftly weaves together a multitude of unforgettable characters as they interplay through their tangle of plotlines. There are some incredible scenes that will forever haunt and delight me in my memory, such as the narrow escape from the scene of the crime which had me holding my breath in anxious anticipation, the darkly comical disaster of the funeral feast, or the emotionally charged and grim meeting between Dunya and the vile Svidriga√Ølov. Each character is carefully balanced with their foil, each character is written with their own unique style of speech and language, and the novel seems to tie every thread together with such perfection and care as it churns forward, raining destruction on the lives of it‚Äôs characters to bring them toward their own personal redemption or demise. 

This was a book that I was unable to put down as the words flowed from their pages to deep within my heart. Dostoevsky brilliantly straps the reader to the emotional states of his characters and is able to create seamless transitions between scenes or from the minds of one character to the next by riding the wings of an emotion. Most often this emotion is guilt, and the murder scene and it‚Äôs feverish follow-up is so expertly crafted that the reader feels they must share in Raskolnikov‚Äôs guilty burden. During the course of reading this book, I was overwhelmed by a crushing sense of guilt that was disconnected to any of my own actions. Yet, had police officers confronted me at any given moment, I would have held out my hands in surrender since I was so burdened by the guilty residue of the novel. What further linked me to the book was Raskolnikov‚Äôs illness following his crime. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt the novel taking root in my soul, perhaps it was due to the cold fall weather that was creeping in at the time, or perhaps it was due to my lack of sleep and early rising to embark on 10-12hr shifts in an unheated factory where I would work away amidst a cloud of aluminum dust, but I felt feverish and ill alongside Raskolnikov and his fever dreams. I don‚Äôt think I felt well again until after finishing the book.

I believe I read Crime and Punishment at the ideal moment in my life. I had spent the summer going through several of Dostoevsky‚Äôs other novels and falling madly in love with his writing. Then my whole life was uprooted. At the time I began C&P, I had moved across the state away from all my friends, family, and everything I knew and recognized, to live in Holland with my brand new baby daughter and work in a factory that could easily serve for a modern day sequel to Sinclair‚Äôs The Jungle. Looking back, I think I can see why I so easily soaked up Raskolnikov‚Äôs feelings. Dostoevsky shows how we are a product of our choices, and it is how we deal with our consequences that makes us who we are. I was placed in the new situation because of choices I had made, like choosing to skip class to smoke and read by the river, and Raskolnikov was faced with the guilt of his own actions. It was the most dramatic shift in my life and I am not a person who enjoys change, yet here I was without a familiar face and nobody to talk to. Crime and Punishment was there in my hand every morning and night as I walked between my home and car, like a friend holding my hand to comfort and encourage me in my exhaustion. It rode shotgun on my hour commutes like a faithful companion, and was the friendly face in which I could take refuge in on my breaks. When stripped of all I knew, there was literature to keep me sane and give me something to hold on to as my world spiraled out of control around me (my daughter was also a tether of sanity for me, but fatherhood was still new and intimidating at the time). Dostoevsky and his beautiful words became my friend and my passion, and in my solitude (because, let‚Äôs face it, I was very much an oddball in that factory and it took awhile to find my place there) I plunged myself deep into books, something I am very thankful for and feel that all the strangeness and loneliness of the existence is washed away by the glow I feel from grappling with my favorite authors. Then I discovered Goodreads and you all became incredibly dear to me. I don‚Äôt think I would have survived my time in that dark pit without you all, so, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

I apologize that this isn‚Äôt really much of a review, I‚Äôm very excited for  this review, as it was seeing this GR friend‚Äîone of which I hold in the highest regard and am always incredibly impressed by‚Äîreading Crime and Punishment that brought back a flood of memories of my times with the book as if I were Proust with his madeleines. I highly recommend this novel, and firmly stand by my choice of it as my favorite. Recently, I had to make a list for work of my top 5 favorite books, which was difficult to do, damn near impossible, but I realized how simple it was to put a book down in the #1 slot. I have read some incredible books since, Hunger (my love of which stems from the similarities to Dostoevsky I noticed in the book), Gravity‚Äôs Rainbow, or To the Lighthouse to name a few, yet nothing has ever left as deep of an impact on me as a reader and as a human being as this book. This is a fantastic book about the human spirit, about our deepest, darkest impulses, and shows that our own inner consciousness can dish out a far greater punishment than any legal system can. Now I need to sleep and sober up.
5/5

*It has now been twelve years since I've read this novel and I remember it less as a book I once read but as a moment in my life I once lived. When I read C&P, admittedly at the right time for such an excursion of thought, it was like a companion that went along with me on a new adventure in what was a seemingly empty and lonely landscape, a friend that chatted with me throughout the day, a book that shared my emotional state with me for better or for worse. I feel like I entered this book as much as it entered me and I'm not entirely sure what I mean by that but I know that I mean it. All I can say is that eight years later no book has ever meant as much to me as this book did and I feel it more as a moment in the timeline of my life than a book upon my shelf.

692,Megan,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Jun 22, 2012",4,"*UPDATE:* I went and saw the movie today and it was a very good movie. Stephen Chbosky directed the movie and it was very true to the book, I would say almost exact. So if you liked the book I would definitely recommend going to see the movie, you will enjoy it! 


I have been struggling with how to rate this book since I finished it. I loved this book but then at the same time it was just okay. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I am finally secure with who I am‚Ä¶ but in high school that wasn‚Äôt true. If I would have read this book in high school I think I would be absolutely in love with it because of the fact, that probably, like most of us at one point in our teens, I felt like an outsider like Charlie. Without my closest friends around me I was a definite ‚Äúwallflower,‚Äù the insecure, quite, nerd who would rather blend in then be seen. 

As I‚Äôm thinking about it now I think that is what was hard about this book for me at points it reminded me of who I was in middle school and the beginning of high school and that is a person I would much rather leave in the past. Sam and Patrick were the friends that pulled Charlie off the wall just as my friends did. I could relate to a lot of what Charlie felt, which I think a lot of us can. I didn‚Äôt do drugs or drink in high school but I‚Äôm sure we all had friends who did or even just know the feelings that led him too. 

 ‚Äú We accept the love we think we deserve,‚Äù


When I first started the book and after the suicide of Michael and the death of his aunt being carefully tiptoed around I initially thought the book was going to be mainly about suicide. In a way I guess it was but not as much as I thought. These are the parts that really spoke to me and I connected to having seen the effects of depression and suicide. After reading about the mixed tape Charlie makes I went and downloaded all the songs and I love the song  Asleep by the Smiths. I wish I had heard this song when I was dealing with everything in high school. I am glad that Stephen Chbosky introduced me to this song and the poem Charlie reads to his friends:

 ‚ÄúThat's why on the back of a brown paper bag
he tried another poem
And he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""
Because that's what it was really all about
And he gave himself an A
and a slash on each damned wrist
And he hung it on the bathroom door
because this time he didn't think
he could reach the kitchen‚Äù


The Pros of this book: The letter writing was a unique format that felt very open and sincere. (Even though I still want to know who he was writing to and what that person thought as they received the letters.) The events in the book seemed real as if they happened in my own high school. The characters were fantastic even if I felt Charlie was being whinny at points, but hey it‚Äôs a letter that‚Äôs probably how it would sound. 

The Cons: Okay the main thing that really bothered me in this book was the essays he was writing for extra work. His teacher claims that he is becoming a better writer each time. The problem I have with that is wouldn‚Äôt his letter writing get better as well? I know it isn‚Äôt in a formal setting but I expected his writing overall to get better which it didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know if it is just me but the writing in the book seemed below a freshman level but that could have to do with the fact that I think that Charlie suffered from some sort of autism. 

Overall I‚Äôm going to give this book a solid 4 stars. The book was quite relatable but I didn‚Äôt expect the twist at the end even though it did make the rest of the book make more sense. I know have a playlist on my iPod labeled as ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äôs Playlist‚Äù and I‚Äôm in love with the song Asleep. 

 ‚ÄúAnd in that moment, I swear we were infinite.‚Äù


This was a powerful line that really spoke to me. I never thought as moments as ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù but it really is true. Those moments when you are truly happy or even on the flip side when the world is crashing down they seem infinite. I love this line. Some may hate it and think it cheesy but sometimes life needs to be cheesy and it needs to be infinite."
693,Lisa of Troy,Gone with the Wind,"Nov 28, 2022",5,"‚ÄúNow, Puss, tell me true, do you understand his folderol about books and poetry and music and oil paintings and such foolishness?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, Pa,‚Äù cried Scarlett impatiently, ‚Äúif I married him, I‚Äôd change all that!‚Äù

When I was a teenager, my goal in life was to be Scarlett O‚ÄôHara (less the slavery aspects and lack of a moral compass). What‚Äôs wrong with being a strong, business-minded, ambitious woman who knows what she wants, someone who can reinvent herself, someone who knows failure but can rebuild from ashes, someone who is brave enough to stand up to naysayers?

Although Gone With the Wind was published in 1936, some things haven‚Äôt changed. A woman who speaks her mind still isn‚Äôt valued by society. There was a study where participants read a story about an ambitious CEO. In one group of participants, the CEO was male. In the other group, female. The participants said that the male was a great guy, someone that you would want to be around, a real go-getter. Regarding the female CEO, the participants said that she would be difficult to work with and unpleasant.
 
In 2016, Fortune magazine ran an article about Erin McKelvey who applied for jobs in the tech industry and got zero responses. After consulting a friend, she ended up listing her name as Mack McKelvey. Her resume had a 70% response rate. 

And the ending of Gone With The Wind‚Ä¶.wow! What an incredible, perfect, memorable ending! What do you think happened after the end of the book?

In a letter, Margaret Mitchell said, ‚ÄúWhether or not Rhett came back to his wife, well, you have me out on a limb. You see, I do not know myself. I honestly never thought about what happened to the characters after the book ended.‚Äù

My extremely scientific and highly accurate internet quiz says that I‚Äôm 77% Scarlett O‚ÄôHara, 39% Rhett Butler, 36% Ashley Wilkes, and 30% Melanie Wilkes. Math is apparently optional for this quiz.

694,Patrick,The Giving Tree,"Sep 28, 2014",5,"I recently read this book to my little boy. 

It's not the first time I've read it. It's probably not even the tenth time. But it's the first time I've read the book in a decade, and given the fact that my memory is like a cheese grater, I like to think I got a pretty fresh experience. 

The result is this: I honestly don't know how I feel about this book. 

Even if you haven't read the story, you probably know the gist of it. A tree loves a young boy and gives away pieces of itself to the boy to make the boy happy. 

On one hand, this story can be taken as an open, honest exhortation toward selfless Agape-style love. Love which asks nothing. Love which gives everything. 

On the other hand, this story can be read as a horrifying condemnation of dysfunctional unrequited co-dependance. 

After reading the book, I honestly don't know which it is. 

On one hand, taking this book at face value is probably a fool's game. Silverstein was a twisted sarcastic bastard. He wrote lyrics for Dr. Hook. (Most notably ""Freaking at the Freaker's Ball."") And back in my misspent youth, I discovered a poem of his in one of my Dad's Playboys. It was called ""The Great Pot Smoke-Off."" 

My point is, dude was part of the counterculture. He was full of mocking and meta. And as such, it seems odd that he would write something that seems like an obvious endorsement of Christ-like selflessness... and then that was it.

But on the other hand, when Silverstein was having fun with you, he usually didn't pussyfoot around. One of his earliest publications was ""Uncle Shelby's ABZ book."" Which *looks* like a kid's book, but is clearly not: 

Here's a piece from the page on Potty Training: 

""See the potty
The potty is deep
The potty has water in the bottom. 

""Maybe someone will fall into the potty and drown. 

""Don't worry. As long as you keep wetting your pants, you will never drown in the potty.""

Not a lot of ambiguity here. His tongue is pretty clearly in his cheek. 

But when I read through The Giving Tree, I don't see the author winking at me from behind the scenes. The story *seems* to be straightforward. 

But here's the thing, even if the story *is* straightforward, I don't know how I feel about it. Is the boy selfish in the story? Absolutely. He's a little shit. Yet he doesn't get one bit of comeuppance. We kinda want him to, but that's not what happens. The boy doesn't seem to learn a lesson. And neither does the tree. 

That seems to imply there is no lesson to be learned here. 

Let's be clear. The tree is *happy* at the end of the book. There's no ambiguity about that. It's entirely possible that the tree has acted in its own best interest. It's entirely possible that the tree, if you'll forgive the expression, is acting according to the Lethani.

Even after thinking it over for a couple days, still I don't know how I feel about it. That's a rarity for me. 

For that reason, I'm giving this five stars. If you write a book that leaves me asking questions. If you write a book that people can have legitimate disagreements about. If you write a book that people can still wrangle over after fifty years‚Ä¶ that's pretty clearly a five-star book."
695,Emily May,Dracula,"May 12, 2011",3,"** spoiler alert **
           I've grown to appreciate this more with age - especially as I've put more distance between myself and the time I studied Dracula at school. But I still think it's overrated. Dracula isn't nearly scary enough, Jonathan Harker is a wet mop of a protagonist, Mina is annoying and the best character [spoiler alert!] gets killed less than halfway into the book. ."
696,Jaline,The Help,"Jan 22, 2019",5,"This is an amazing and moving novel. So much so that tasks, appointments, and everything else in my life were put on hold while I read, laughed, cried, celebrated, hurt, and felt healed. Some friends once told me about a spiritual teacher who would often say, ‚ÄúThere is magic in the telling‚Äù. The truth in those words vibrates throughout this brilliantly conceived and executed novel.

The author herself talks about the risk of a white woman telling the stories of black women living in an era of slow transition between overt, undisguised racism and a more covert and secretive racism. Yet, many white people of that time did not recognize racism for what it was: the structure of society was simply their everyday life. As long as the black people needed the jobs offered by white society, they would be subject to obeying every command, swallowing frustration, anger, and their own pride ‚Äì and usually for much less than minimum wage. The consequences of not swallowing were just too dangerous.

This novel, a book about writing a book about the domestic service of black women in early 1960‚Äôs Mississippi is a finely balanced, on-the-edge story ‚Äì like a tightrope walker dozens of feet above Niagara Falls. One slip, one false step, and the entire premise would collapse into the water.

Instead, there is a rare and precious authenticity to these stories that are thematically pulled together by Skeeter - the white woman determined to write the book, and Aibileen ‚Äì the black domestic worker employed by one of Skeeter‚Äôs friends. And then there is Minny. Rebellious, full of anger, intelligent, wise, and good - how she was able to cope with a home life filled with conflict and carry on working fulltime besides is beyond me.

My admiration for so many of these characters started small and continued to build throughout the novel. Their lives, their experiences, their authenticity and humanity touched my soul. I will always be grateful to this beautifully crafted novel for opening my eyes and my heart to a larger perspective."
697,Will M.,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Nov 03, 2013",5,"I can't believe it took me forever to finally read this. I chose to watch the movie first last year, because I remember not having the physical copy of the book yet. That was the biggest mistake of my reading life.

The book is way better than the movie. I know you've probably seen that phrase a million times, but I can't fully express how it truly applies to Ender's Game. I can't find a flaw even if I wanted to. Everything seems perfectly written and constructed. I'm going to be honest and say that I hated most of the overhyped books here on goodreads, but the hype that Ender's Game received's truly deserving. It lived up to my expectations, and continued to amaze me as every page went by.

The character development in this novel's truly astounding. It's really nothing like the way the movie introduced the characters. Everyone in the novel felt important, and their transformation had a huge impact to me. Valentine and Peter were both very much established, and their life journey [as children] was somewhat different, but completely interesting and amusing at the same time. If I remember correctly, the movie didn't even show that both of them  became  Demosthenes and Locke. That part of their story truly amazed me. This novel showed that age doesn't matter in making a difference. It's all about courage and knowledge to truly express what's inside your head. I didn't like Peter in the moral sense, but his violence and bullying led to Ender and Valentine's positive growth. It may have affected Ender in a bad way, but if you look at the overall change that Ender exuded, it's remarkable how violence led to success.

I think I'm going to retract my statement that I can't think of any flaws. I believe the author was too harsh with his characters, too harsh in a sense that it became a bit unbelievable. Unbelievable in the sense that I haven't really encountered a child who was pushed too much that he's capable of murder. I'm not talking about Ender, because despite everything he did, his humanity was still very much evident. I'm talking about Bonzo. How could he be capable of murder, and not have any guilt afterwards. If the author presented a violent past, then maybe I could still digest the fact that he became  evil , but he was just evil like that. He expressed his anger by raging on Ender, without a concrete and well-explained reason why. That's the only  problem  I could think of, and it's not even really a problem to be honest. It's so minor that the magnificence of the novel can easily cover up this personal opinion of mine. It's not even bothering me, I just wanted to present a slight flaw so that this review wouldn't seem to kiss the novel's ass so much, even though I think it is.



 I've lived too long with pain. I won't know who I am without it 



Yeah, that line in the near end says it all. Ender's a changed man, call me sadistic, but I believe it changed him for the better. He's become the strong young man he's supposed to be.

The plot and character development were both amazing, as I repeat. It's original [for me at least] and the ending truly depicts that the author's not done trying to destroy Ender's humanity. I can't wait to read the succeeding novels, even the Shadow series after. This series made it to my top favorite, alongside A Song of Ice and Fire, or maybe I could just say that this is my favorite Sci-Fi book, and possibly series. If you really read the review, then it's obvious that I'm giving this the highest possible recommendation to anyone. The hype might make you cautious, but seriously, this is novel is amazing. 

5/5 stars, truly remarkable."
698,Justin Tate,Gone with the Wind,"Feb 21, 2019",5,"Gone with the Wind is a masterpiece of creative writing on every level. In its 1400 pages (or 49 hours on audio) there is not a single wasted line or insignificant moment. From a purely technical perspective, it is awe-inducing how flawlessly Mitchell utilizes characterization, setting, research, conflict, point of view, narrative voice, symbolism, foreshadowing, allusion, and every other literary device in the handbook. Even more amazing, she can juggle all this and deliver a plot that is relentlessly enjoyable. 

The closest novel I've read to this quality is Les Miserables, which was clearly the template for Gone with the Wind. In case there is any doubt, Melanie goes so far as to read directly from its pages during a moment of high tension. Even in Les Miserables, however, there are hundreds of pages of dully written history that is disjunctive and awkward in the flow of narration. Mitchell, following Hugo's formula, also includes segments of war history. Her historical segments work much better, however, because they are short and play a more direct role in the action. Les Miserables is commonly read in an abridged format, but it would be impossible to abridge Gone with the Wind. Every word has a purpose, everything a cause and reaction.

Writers seeking examples of superb characterization should also look no further. Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie (among others) are so finely drawn as to boggle the mind. How is it possible for such flawed individuals to be so absorbing? How can fiction feel this real? Even stronger than each individual character is Mitchell's handling of relationships. The way these characters mold to one another, influence one another, speak in subtext and interact creates a world so vivid that real life begins to feel dull.

Despite its long-running popularity, I feel Gone with the Wind (the novel) is perhaps the most underrated classic of all time. There should be no contest. Any list of classic literature that doesn't include Gone with the Wind in the Top 10 is simply wrong. I suspect part of why it gets forgotten as a novel is the iconic movie. I'm so thankful to have mostly avoided the movie thus far, so I could fully enjoy the novel's many surprises on its own. For those who are already well-versed with the movie, I suspect the novel will still blow you away. I just can't imagine how they could efficiently cram 49 hours of book into a 4 hour movie.

Although it was intimidating to devote so much time to a behemoth like this, I never regretted it for a second. Gone with the Wind is one of those masterpieces that is an actual shame if you never get to it.

**SIDE NOTE: The unabridged audio version narrated by Linda Stephens is the best audio performance I've ever encountered. Her performance might very well have elevated my opinion of the novel. I recommend listening to it if you can."
699,emma,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Jul 07, 2014",1,"i have always hated this book.

maybe it's because i hate being sad, and nothing on god's great green earth makes me sadder than lonely people. even if the story i'm reading is about people no longer being lonely, that requires reading about them starting out that way, doesn't it!

maybe it's that this book is a true who's who of every social issue, traumatic event, and general and various Bad Thing and Unpleasant Subject the author could think of, while just barely scraping over the 200 page mark.

maybe it's that i find books like this, which are seemingly very admirably intended to let teens know they aren't alone, more often lead to a romanticization of solitude and a detestation of happy people / mainstream people / popular people in our moldable youth that lasts a lifetime and creates some of the most miserably performative and performatively miserable human beings on the planet.

or maybe i'm just a hater.

let's call it all of the above and move on.

this review is part of an unfortunate series, in which i hop on my cute little soapbox and talk about books i read a long time ago"
700,karen,Twilight ,"Jul 02, 2010",0,"spoiler alert: he's a vampire!!!

has anyone heard any press on this book yet?? i think that once the teens hear about it, the author will be quite successful. definite cinematic potential here.
................................................................................

pop - there goes my meyer cherry! and with it my integrity. 

this, sadly, isn't one of those twilight reviews that is going to get a zillion votes. it isn't going to be particularly insightful or funny or anything like that. it is mostly just a stunned reaction to a book that i vowed i would never read. and i know i am about to lose a ton of street cred, but you know what?? itsnotthatbad.

there.

i know, intellectually, that i shouldn't have enjoyed this book, but the feelings - they respond. and that is today's theme - the power of the emotions to o'erthrow zee brain. we will return to this theme later.


i have friends who love this book. 

i have friends who hate this book. 

i have friends who have never read this book, but still openly mock its fans and say things like ""oh edward, you sparkle so gooood"" - oh wait - no, that was me. oops.

i was totally apprehensive about starting this and possibly having to revise my previous and very vocal anti-twilight stance. i do not like admitting i am wrong. i am a very stubborn lady. and i figured, despite all my yelly-facing, i could honestly go either way. 

but i did it. and it's really not at all bad. true - there are some moments that are terrible, particularly in its editing. ""ballet bar"", ""dust moats"", ""had been belonged to me"". OMFG SRSLY stephenie, you can't afford a copy editor?? and while we are at it - your name is also a typo. and there is so much chuckling and tooth grinding and fist balling (heh) and jaw clenching it seems like a ticcy nicolas cage movie at times. and the repetition of words for edward; ""beautiful"" and ""heavenly"" and ""sublime"" and ""perfect"" ""perfect"" ""perfect"". christmas wishlist: a thesaurus for stephenie.

but more than that.

from what i had heard - the big complaint about this book was bella. i was expecting some vapid, swoony, clumsy, clingy, weak little thing who was a terrible role model for the young misses and a blight upon the face of womynhood. but she is actually pretty badass. she drives a massive truck and is good at science and likes to read and hates the prom and is pretty fearless and would hook a finger in your eye and pop it out instead of running away if she felt threatened. i can get behind that. 

so what are the complaints actually about?? her selfless devotion to edward; her willingness to sacrifice and surrender herself for a boy. a vampire. a much older man. a creature known for its powers of mesmerism and allure.

the ultimate bad boy.

well, duh! 

this is precisely how it feels to be a 17-year-old girl deeply in love. it's fight, kill, or die for your beloved. see, i was one, so i can speak to the phenomenon firsthand. and from here on out, if it makes you feel more comfortable; if you have a problem with sweeping generalities, when i use the phrase ""17-year-old-girl"", feel free to substitute ""karen t. brissette""

17-year-old girls are drawn to the bad boy

17-year-old girls in love do not think, they feel

17-year-old girls are dangerously self-absorbed (when ""self"" includes the beloved because they are one soul etc etc) 

17-year-old girls do not give one shit about what kind of example they are setting for others of their gender

17-year-old girls are all too inclined to sacrifice,to become a martyr for their love, to believe in the magic of the world and the power of infatuation, and to risk it all to prolong that infatuation

17-year-old girls lack cynicism and have no real frame of reference yet or any extensive battle scars, or relationship track record; everything is here and now and the most important thing in the history of the world.

so, yeah, bella, i get you. you are not a victim. and your clumsiness (and mine) are very endearing.as is your commitment. i once walked miles barefoot on the summer blacktop to show my devotion to mine, he pulled equally stupid demonstrative stunts - there were blowups and reconciliations and third-party interventions and i became love and it was wonderful, mercurial, mad mad mad.

so,yeah, bells, i get your depth of feeling.

forget team edward
forget team jacob
i am resoundingly team bella.

and i was also told this was one of the most erotic novels of all time, by my most favorite professor, and i rolled my eyes at the time, thinking ""why does everyone like this damn book so much??""but you know what?? she was right. this is totally virgin porn. straight up sweaty virgin porn.

and of course, all vampire lit is porn, where the bloodsucking stands in for the sex act etc etc. but what if both parties are acting against nature/their inclinations?

he is repressing his desire to drink her blood

she is repressing her desire to touch him

both feel the strain of resistance and every time they are close - there is amazing heightened tension.and it is - it is pretty damn hot.

hoofa.


so, yeah, like cottage cheese, i have come around in my thinking about this book. but i refuse to give this a star rating. let me hold on to that much of my pride.

come to my blog!"
701,Anu,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Aug 29, 2007",5,"August 2007

I was riding in a cab in Bombay recently, and a bookseller on foot approached me at a traffic light with a stack of books. I did my best not to look at the boy, but I couldn't help it. He was waving several books in my face and something caught my eye. I thought my glance was discreet, but he saw me look.. and it was game over. The light turned green right then and the boy starts running with the cab yelling 'Memsahib! Memsahib!'. We're picking up speed.. I'm so scared he's going to get his foot runover so I grab whatever I could from my wallet and somehow get it into his hands. In return he tosses a random book at me through the window as he's getting further & further away from the cab. I look to see what I ended up with. It was A Thousand Splendid Suns, which I was planning on buying anyways. The cab driver asked me how much I ended up giving the boy. 'A hundred and fifty rupees,' I said, which is barely $4. The cab driver says in return, 'You paid a hundred rupees too much!'. Hardly, I thought to myself. That boy worked his butt off. The best part is because the book is bootlegged it's full of typos and random fonts. Love it. In case I ever discuss the book with you and my recollection of the story is completely different from what you read, you'll know why.

January 2008

Read the book on my way to Vietnam a few days ago. Loved it, although it was missing a few pages here and there :). Coincidentally, the friend I'm traveling with brought the same book on our trip so I had access to the missing pages. (And another coincidence - our Mekong Delta guide was carrying a copy of the Kite Runner. We were like some sort of Hosseini fanclub floating down the Mekong in our longboat...haha). I have a few thoughts on this book, I'll write them out in more detail soon. I'm heading back to Bombay in a few days...maybe I'll run into another bookseller on foot :)."
702,theburqaavenger‚ûπ,The Princess Bride,"Jun 16, 2019",4,"If you are a person who grew up in the US or UK or in any part of the world or I dunno a spaceship, you would probably know what someone means when they say ‚ÄúInconceivable!‚Äù but for me, a person who grew in Pakistan where the most popular thing was Justin Bieber singing ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù while the children tried to copy whatever the heck that dude was saying, life was not so generous. I didn‚Äôt know what Harry Potter was. He was a jadoogar ki aulad (son of a magician) as my mother likes to say. 

A few months ago I was looking at a list of the best ‚Äúbook to film‚Äù adaptations and this baby was on the top. I immediately googled it and I thought what the heck? This gets the top spot. Of course then I watched the film and then I bought the book and then I read it and the rest is history.

This has been said so many times and I will sound like a broken record but that film is amazing. In this case, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a case of either/or; both mediums of telling this story are delightful, and I love them both for different reasons. First off, that film is fantastic. The casting, the direction ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pure perfection. Yes the effects are cheesy but that was 1987 so *shrugs*. Yes, the film does exclude some points and there some itty bitty changes but HAVE YOU SEEN THAT FILM? Plus it gets bonus points for *ahem ahem* Cary Elwes. I don‚Äôt even need to explain myself.



Now onto the review. You know some people might tell you that the plot of this book is pathetic/dumb/over done/nothing special. But i would strongly disagree with them. Why? Well because for me Goldman took the itty bitty pieces that everyone uses and he created something new from it. I mean isn't this a stereotype? Poor boy. Pretty girl. But Goldman has included so much more elements into this tale. First off, that beginning line is everything.


‚ÄúThis is my favorite book in all the world, though I have never read it.‚Äù


 
Next off, the concept is so novel. You rarely come across something like this. It's fast paced and it can tick every box you can think of. As the author says, this book has:


‚ÄúFencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles.‚Äù

 
He used the word ""beautifulest"" and the only thing that isn't there is magical realism and ice-cream but everything else is there. That's a winner for me dude.

Secondly, i am a horribly sarcastic person in real life. So for me (one of) the strength of this book lies in the narration from Goldman himself. The way he pokes fun, his satire, his commentary ... throughout the book it's hilarious. From the very beginning, the reader is introduced to the story through the witty voice of Goldman. For me this outside narration feels like an entirely different story in itself.

And then we have the characters. The characters in ""The Princess Bride"" are phenomenal from all angles. No matter what kinds of characters you prefer reading about, there‚Äôs bound to be one that you end up rooting for.

üëë
Westley:

Let's cut the crap and get to the real point. Westley. Now and forever. I love everything about him: his remarkable bravery, his unfailing loyalty to Buttercup, and even his constant reply of ‚ÄúAs you wish.‚Äù If you‚Äôre looking for a dashing hero that will make your heart flutter, then look no further than this farm boy!

üëë
Inigo:

 I was astounded by the amount of information we learn in this novel about Inigo‚Äôs past compared to the what background the movie provides. A better understanding of his past allowed me to appreciate Inigo so much more, and it made that one famous line infinitely more satisfying.



üëë
Fezzik:

Oh, Fezzik. I love his clever rhymes, his sensitive side, and his faithful courage. I prefer his portrayal in the novel rather than that of the movie because the reader can see more of his inner personality beyond the outward stereotype of his bulky size.

üëë
Prince Humperdinck:

I mean, he has a Zoo of Death in which he methodically keeps deadly animals in carefully organized levels in order to hunt and kill them for fun. If that doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúevil psychotic prince,‚Äù then I don‚Äôt know what does.

üëë
Buttercup:

I loved Buttercup. Yes she is a 'damsel in distress' but dude chill. She is kind and caring although a bit vain. She doesn't bear grudges and goes with Humperdinck to save Westley. 

A gem. A true gem. A masterpiece. Please dear person read this.

Plus, I took the job out of Nina's hands for the time being and decided to explain Hogwarts Houses with Princess Bride quotes:


Gryffindor:





Hufflepuff:





Ravenclaw:





Slytherin:




Thank you for attending the Sorting Ceremony. Nina take your job back"
703,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Aug 31, 2022",4,"Stephen Chbosky tells us the story of an introvert, Charlie, through this novel. 


 
Charlie might be awkward at social events but is a brilliant innocent person with excellent thinking capacity. 

Nobody can blame you if you feel deja vu when you read his letters. It is that much relatable to our lives. The author beautifully depicts how he explores everything in his life for the first time through the friendship of Patrick and Sam. The author realistically portrays the difficulties and curiosities of a young adult's life.


What I learned from this book 


1) How can we take charge of our life during difficult circumstances? 

We can never fully safeguard our life from negative experiences. We inevitably have to go through some negative experiences in our life. But we can control how we react to it. If we are able to react judiciously, our life will never go off track during trying circumstances. 
 ""So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.""  


2) What is the greatest gift you can give your loved ones? 

Presence is the biggest present that you can give your loved ones. When there is a person to just sit near you and make you feel they are with you no matter whatever happens in your life and willing to hear you patiently, you should consider yourself the luckiest person. 
 ‚ÄúWe didn't talk about anything heavy or light. We were just there together. And that was enough.""  


3) Why do people want to be in a relationship when they are single and want to be single when they are in a relationship? 

I think the best state a human being can achieve in their life is to be attached to an individual in a relationship and feel free and independent at the same time. In simpler terms, we should have a relationship without compromising the identities and individuality of both individuals. It is a complex state that only true soulmates can achieve.

When the relationship is not in an ideal state, as I mentioned above, singles might feel life boring due to the lack of attachment, and couples will find life boring due to the loss of individuality.
 ""If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am. And I don't want them to carry it around inside. I want them to show me, so I can feel it, too. I want them to be able to do whatever they want around me.""  



My favourite three lines from this book 

 ‚ÄúThings change. And friends leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.""  

 ‚ÄúI would die for you. But I won't live for you.‚Äù  

  ""I just want you to know that you're very special‚Ä¶ and the only reason I'm telling you is that I don't know if anyone else ever has.""  
 

What could have been better?

There are a lot of trigger warnings in this book, like sexual abuse, domestic abuse, incest, and drug abuse. Some readers might find it difficult to read these parts of this book.


Rating 

 4/5 This is one of the best coming-of-age books I have read. If you liked the book Catcher in the rye, you should definitely try this book."

You will cry, because this is VERY sad.

So a discussion occurred in my head after I rated the book. 

(view spoiler)[A voice in my head: Come on. You can't post that on Goodreads. 

Me: *glares* Why not? 

A voice in my head (aka VH): Please, don't. You will ruin your reputation. 

Me: *weary* Not that again. 

VH: Well, it's true. You can't post that. It's just not okay. Do you have any idea how popular this book is? Hint : YOU CAN'T EVEN GUESS.

Me: Why should I care? Maybe some people think like me.

VH: You don't understand. It's not just random book that you can critize like you do all the time and just get away with it. This is THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. And it's John Green. Believe me, you do NOT want to get in the way of those crazy fans, nerdfighters or whatever it is they call themselves. 

Me: Really, what the fuck do I care? I want to give this 3 stars. It's not like I'm giving it 1 star or something. 

VH: But why would you even do that in the first place? EVERYONE, and I do mean EVERYONE in your friend list gave it 5 stars. And they used so many sobbing gifs! Really, it made me cry a little just looking at them. 

Me: *stares*

VH: It won the Goodreads award for best YA!

Me: So? Fifty Shades won Best Romance. 

VH: It's got one of the highest general ratings for a book on Goodreads!

Me: Nobody but the Goodreads community actually cares. And wait. I'm not even sure the Goodreads community actually cares. I know I don't.

VH: You're such a cold-hearted bitch. Why would you give it only 3 stars anyway? Don't you have a heart? And why 3 stars? I know you really loved the book, deep down! 

Me: I didn't. I mean, I liked it, it was okay... but I didn't love it. It's... I mean... Oh, fuck it. It's overrated. There! I said it. Sue me. 

VH: *seethes* You did NOT just say that. 

Me : I did. Because it is! Come on, did you read the dialogues in this? Can we talk about the dialogues? I want to talk about the dialogues.

VH: *crosses arms* Go ahead. I want examples.

Me: Fine. I'll start with the popular quotes. You know what I'm talking about. The quotes which are totally overrated and everyone loves them and they create pics and stuff when really, if you think about the quote in itself.. Well, you realize that it just, you know, sucks. 

VH: *mumbles* How 'bout: you suck?

Me: What was that? Actually, forget it, I don't give a shit. Listen to this! ‚ÄúMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.‚Äù

VH: So? It's beautiful.

Me: Well...*tries really hard to refrain from laughing* I mean... Seriously? Like... *fails miserably* HAHAHAHA how more pretentious can you get? Comparing your thoughts to stars? REALLY?

VH: You're so shallow. Some of us have deep thoughts, you know. Like, thoughts so deep they actually deserve to be compared to the firmament. I don't even want to explain to you how poetic this is, because I'd waste my time. 

Me: Save yourself the effort, I don't mind. And I've got another example. Probably my favorite.
""That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.""

VH: What now? You're gonna say that it's so pretentious it made you cry?

Me: Precisely. *nods wisely* Because that's the thing about tears. They demand to be wet. Or that's the thing about food. It demands to be eaten. Or that's the thing about...

VH: SHUT UP, I get it! There's no discussion with you. How am I supposed to discuss with someone who's got the intellectual depth of an empty oyster?

Me: But come on, I'm not finished yet. What about Augustus and his unlit cigarette?
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt kill you unless you light them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôve never lit one. It‚Äôs a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don‚Äôt give it the power to do its killing.‚Äù

Me: Is this supposed to be smart? This is pathetic. It's terrible, it's not funny, and it's not deep. 

VH: *hisses* It's a metaphor!

Me: I know!
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a metaphor,‚Äù I said, dubious. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a metaphor,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúYou choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances...‚Äù I said.
‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù He smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace.‚Äù

Me: Can you say metaphor again? Say metaphor one more time! Go ahead, say it, I think John Green hasn't totally forced it down my throat yet! *hysterical yelling* LET'S SAY IT AGAIN! Metaphor! Everything is a METAPHOR!

VH: What's your point, you freak?

Me: My point is, the dialogues are horrible. It made my eyes burn. It's pretentious and unbelievable, AND besides, you can totally see that John Green loves the characters.

VH: What author doesn't like the characters of their own book?

Me: It's not the same! With John Green... It's like he adores himself. I bet you anything he re-reads his own books. Just to see exactly how awesome they are. 

VH: What? You don't know that. You cannot possibly say that. How dare you talk about him like you know him.

Me: You know, in the audio version of The Fault in Our Stars, at the end, there's an interview with him. And he explicitly says that he just LOVES listening to the audio versions of his books. So there.

VH: What? No. You're wrong. He doesn't mean, like, he loves it when someone reads him his own books. That's not what he meant AT ALL. It's a misunderstanding. What he meant was, he loves listening to the.. the.. reading lady. Because she has such a sweet voice and everything. 

Me: Are you kidding me? He's in love with himself! Augustus is just an hologram. An empty shell. Seriously, his monologues are laughable. I couldn't even focus. I kept thinking of John Green while reading. Because Augustus is just SO witty, so smart, so perfect. *cough cough* wish fulfillment hello.

VH: I am so not convinced.

Me: There's this whole repetition thing, too. I cannot believe how all the characters of his books look alike. How come it works every SINGLE time? How many books are out there, now? 4? 5? More, surely. It's always the SAME THING. Geeky and nerdy narrator, geekier and nerdier sidekick, mysterious but unbelievable girl, random plot that doesn't even make sense, road trip. Come the fuck on. You know what? The fact that people aren't getting tired of him and his stupid same characters is the real question.

VH: But this book is unique. The way it deals with cancer and death... It's so beautiful. You cannot possibly say it isn't.

Me: That's what disturbed me the most. Look. What I want to say is, not every death is glorious. Not every death is epic and not every death will glow like a star in the eternal twilight sky. Most of the time, deaths are random, plain, and the world is cold and uncaring, and that's how it is. And that's what's terrible. You don't need to be a hero, you don't need to defy death the way Augustus pretends to, you don't need to lose yourself in unbelievable speeches to have people cry over your death. The book is just TOO much. 

VH: You know, about them being unbelievable when they talk? You seem to forget something. Augustus and Hazel ARE different. They're unique, so they talk different. That's what it's all about.

Me: They're not different, they don't exist. They can't exist. Honestly? I don't think this was a good tribute to the kids who are really sick. Because no one talks like that, NO ONE, and I feel like now there's this messed-up hierarchy between the sick kids who are sort of smart ass and those who aren't. And I refuse that. I can't accept that. Being ironic, jaded, detached and all metaphorical over the disease is a luxury that genuinely sick teenagers cannot afford. So fuck this. And I'd rather kneel before a kid who has cancer and who doesn't know what a metaphor is than shed a tear over one of Augustus's stupid monologues.

VH: You liar, I know you cried while you read the book. You were a sobbing mess.

Me: I wasn't. I was a sobbing mess at the end of Before I Die. And oh my God, I couldn't even speak after I finished A Monster Calls because I was crying so hard. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl had me in tears, too. These are all gorgeous books that deal with cancer. And I cried like a bitch every single time, and they broke my heart. But this? I didn't cry.

VH: You did, and you know it. Especially at THIS special moment.

Me: *looks away* I don't know what you're talking about.

VH : You cried when Hazel asked her mom if she would still be a mom after her death.

Me: Fine, okay. I cried. I know. Okay? I know. But look. That's precisely the point. That's what I call emotional blackmail. Because I DARE YOU not to cry over that discussion. Because it's a universal fear! Whether you're a mom, or a daughter, or both, if you have a sister even, you must have thought about that already and told yourself : Okay, if I die, or if she dies. Who will I be? If my sister dies and I'm asked whether I have a sibling, what should I say? Am I still a sister because she existed, once? Or if you have a child, and then one day your baby dies. What happens then? Are you still a parent? Are you still a parent because once, you used to be a parent, and because there's a room upstairs that used to be your child's? I dare you to think about it and not end up crying. I took it as a betrayal from John Green because I feel like he didn't play fair. OF COURSE talking about a child's death in this peculiar way will make the reader cry! But it's so easy. It doesn't require any talent. Just ask anyone to talk about that and they'll be tearing up in 5 seconds! Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I feel like he was like, ""I'm gonna make them cry."" and all the while I was reading I swear I could hear him: ""ARE YOU SAD YET? ARE YOU HEARTBROKEN YET? DO YOU SEE HOW INCREDIBLY UPSETTING MY STORY IS? I KNOW, RIGHT. I AMAZE MYSELF SOMETIMES.""

VH: But--

Me: No, look. Writing like that, it's not incredible, it's not magical and it's not valuable. It's playing with people's weaknesses. It's manipulating people into crying. And I can't respect him with that the way I respect people who manage to make me cry without using such poor plot devices. Like in, Me and Earl and The Dying Girl. There's a cancer book that really took me by surprise. Because, Rachel, the sick girl, is everything but admirable. She's young, a bit shallow, nice, shy, plain, normal, really. And her neighbor who befriends her, he doesn't fall in love with her. And her death won't be remembered like something that scarred humanity, because it didn't. Ultimately, it didn't even matter at all. And I could relate more easily to that, to the meaningless dimension of her death, to the emptiness of it all, more than I could ever relate to the ridiculous speeches of Augustus (and Hazel's too, for that matter). Because you know what bothered me, too? They're indistinct. 

VH: That's because they're soul mates. That's the whole point of the book. They found themselves in each other.

Me: It doesn't work to say they're soul mates. Look, I read the book almost a year ago, I think. And this:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm in love with you, and I‚Äôm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I‚Äôm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we‚Äôre all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we‚Äôll ever have, and I am in love with you.‚Äù

Me: This is beautiful, granted. It's also unrealistic that a teenager would ever say that, let alone improvize it, but whatever, it's pretty. But the thing is, I am completely unable to say whether it's Augustus or Hazel who says that. I don't know. I have no idea. I try to recognize the style, but I can't tell, BECAUSE THEY TALK EXACTLY THE SAME.

VH: ...

Me: So yeah. I didn't love the book, and I am not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things; I didn't love the book, and I know this review might be just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed to another John Green book about an unbelievable loser and his even more loser sidekick loving an unbelievable teenage girl, and that there will come a day when maybe he will change his writing formula, and maybe that'll come when the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, but then it'll be too late, so who cares? I didn't love this book.

VH: *suspiciously silent*

Me: Are we done?

VH: FINE. Ugh. Okay. *Waves white flag* I surrender.

Me: Yes! *clicks ""save review""*

708,Ethan,The Da Vinci Code ,"Jul 15, 2008",3,"Four stars for pure entertainment value.

However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:


`The Da Vinci Code,' cracked
by Dave Barry

I have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:

MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!

LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!

MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .

SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!

The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.

CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.

''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''

CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.

''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.

Heckman felt he could trust her.

''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.

''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''

CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''

''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''

''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''

But just then, the chapter ended.

CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''

''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''

''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''

''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''

''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.

''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''

CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.

''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.

''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.

''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''

''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.

''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .

But just then, shots rang out.

CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''

''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''

''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''

''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.

CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''

''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''

''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''

''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''

They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available..."

710,Katerina,City of Bones ,"Dec 01, 2014",5,"‚ÄúShadowhunters: Looking Better in Black Than the Widows of our Enemies Since 1234.‚Äù


I read City of Bones for the first time 5 years ago. I still remember that day. The sun was shining, the birds were singing It was during my first semester in Law School and I had to study History of Law, which was a complete waste of time because seriously, who is ever going to ask me whether women in Byzantium could get a divorce? (In case you are wondering, they could only if the husband was impotent or possessed). Aaanyway, I wanted a break and I grabbed this beautiful book and started reading until I finished it, bleary-eyed, disoriented and obsessed. A typical day in Kat-verse. 




So what's the story?

Shadowhunters (ninja warriors with angel blood) fight demons and co-exist with vampires, werewolves, fae and warlocks while a former Shadowhunter with nazi tendencies threatens to destroy them.



City of Bones is a fast-paced, action-packed paranormal book that keeps you invested in the story and the characters since page 1. A nerd, a heartbreaker, a jealous friend, a warlock who loves glitter, a werewolf, an artist and a gorgeous warrior introduce you to a world of magic, where nightmares come true, truths are revealed and decisions have to be made. Diving into this world is easy, effortless and so, so enjoyable.


‚ÄúIs this the part where you start tearing off strips of your shirt to bind my wounds?""
""If you wanted me to rip my clothes off, you should have just asked.‚Äù 


Humour and sassiness are all over the place and witty banters crack you up. But mind that there is also drama, plot twists and shocking moments that make you question the writer's humanity (and maybe sanity). Cassandra Clare has a unique ability, her writing can heal and stab your poor heart.


‚ÄúThe boy never cried again, and he never forgot what he'd learned: that to love is to destroy, and that to be loved is to be the one destroyed.‚Äù


I need to warn you about Jace. He is the kind of bad boy who makes rude gestures to nuns and loves weapons and treats everything like a joke and is a total badass. You will fall in love with him and swoon and want to have his babies but you're in for disappointment. Because he is mine.



So that's the general awesomeness of the Mortal Instruments.

711,Emily May,The Hunger Games ,"Dec 24, 2010",4,"It seems weird that I never reviewed 
The Hunger Games
. I don't know why I didn't when it was a series that completely took over my life for a short while. But recently I've been thinking about posting something in this review space and after just watching the second film (which I think was amazing and better than the first), now seems like as good a time as any to talk about why I love Katniss and nearly everything about this series.

I gave this book four stars back in 2011 and I'm going to leave that rating as it is because it's an indicator of my thoughts at the time (though they slightly differ now) - thoughts which were influenced by having just finished the fantastic, horrifying, brutal and unforgettable Battle Royale manga series. I don't think it was the best time for myself and Katniss to find one another when I had so much beautiful insanity to compare the book to, but it still managed to have such an effect on me that I instantly told every friend and family member to read it. Coming back to this now after having spent the last couple of years being bombarded with dystopian YA, I appreciate what Collins has achieved a whole lot more. 

I appreciate the strength of Katniss as a heroine who commands our attention and holds our love whilst still being what some would consider unlikable; I appreciate the balance of beauty and horror that Collins delivers on every page, treating us constantly to both the darkest despair and rays of hope; and I also - amazingly - appreciate the love triangle. Love triangles seem to have chased me and hunted me down with every YA read I picked up over the last two or three years - my dislike for romance instantly becoming doubled by the introduction of yet another boy with beautiful eyes. But Katniss, Peeta and Gale worked for me. They convinced me, held my interest and made me cry. The love triangle worked because it's outcome wasn't obvious, because we all wondered and hoped and worried. Because, either way, I was always going to be half happy and half sad.

Katniss still remains for me everything that a female protagonist should be. Or a female hero, at least. She fights for the ones she loves, she's brave and doesn't need to be saved. But neither is she a one-dimensional smiling poster-version of a heroine. She falls, she fails, people get hurt because of her and she has to live with that. We love her and yet she's antisocial, awkward and moody. She loves other people with all her heart but she's not much of a team player. In short: she's a complex portrait of a young woman that doesn't fall into any neatly defined boxes or categories. Now, perhaps, authors have since tried to recreate her. But she's still one of the first and best.

I know another review of this book isn't needed. I know you've all probably read it anyway. Or never will. But this isn't really for anyone else; it's a reminder to myself of why this book deserves its hype and why I need to remember to come back to it again and again between the new (and hopefully amazing) YA books I'll be reading in the future."

713,Dean Ryan Martin,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Feb 15, 2020",3,"Done reading THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. This edition I own contains the seven unabridged books arranged in chronological order.

Author's Writing Style: 5 stars!!! It is ideally written for children in third-person POV in past tenses. The written narration is easy to read and understand (...except for its small font size which can be torturing to the eyes especially for the sleep-deprived). Pacing is fast, it's not wasting time for descriptions. 

Character/s Development: 3 stars!!! Aslan is my number one favorite character. This is an ideal choice, I know, but I love the idea that everyone respects, and at the same time, fears him due to his reputation. Aslan receives more pagetime in The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe - the second book in the series. I get to see how he submits himself to vulnerability and how he bounces back after being bullied. Not a fan of him but Edmund makes a mark on me. In Books 4, 5 and 7, he proves to himself that he is someone special after betraying his siblings due to Turkish Delight.

Plot: 3 stars!!! I commend the series for having a different plot in every book. I mean, the main characters are children, yes, but it doesn't always follow a strict and predictable formula. For example, Book 2 - The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe and Book 3 - The Horse & His Boy tell a different inspiring story without putting similar feels in the plot quality. Book 3 is my top favorite it terms of plot. It delivers, it connects, it finishes strong. I am a bit disappointed with the ""travel for a rescue mission plot"" in Book 5 - The Voyage of The Dawn Treader. This book heavily reminds me of the plot used in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & The Olympians. And the ending in Book 7 - The Last Battle gives me a real good punch, I need a moment to ponder about that."

This was the biggest piece of garbage I've ever read after The Kite Runner. Just as with The Kite Runner, I'm (somewhat) shocked that this book is a bestseller and has been given awards, chewed up and swallowed by the literary masses and regarded as greatness. Riiiight. 
 
The whole thing can be summed up as the story of a girl who sometimes steals books coming of age during the Holocaust. Throw in the snarky narration by Death (nifty trick except that it doesn't work), a few half-assed drawings of birdies and swastikas, senseless and often laughable prose that sounds like it was pulled from the ""poetry"" journal of a self-important 15 year-old, and a cast of characters that throughout are like watching cardboard cutouts walking around VERY SLOWLY, and that's the novel. 
 
Here are some humble observations. 
 
First, chances are that you, Mr. Zusak, are not Antonin Chekhov. You are, therefore, incapable of properly describing the weather for use as a literary device, and you end up sounding like an asshole. Don't believe me?

""I like a chocolate-colored sky. Dark, dark chocolate."" Really? Do you, now? 

""The sky was dripping. Like a tap that a child has tried it‚Äôs hardest to turn off but hasn‚Äôt quite managed.‚Äù Really?? Wow. Next you'll tell me that the rain was like a shower. I'm moved. 

""Oh, how the clouds stumbled in and assembled stupidly in the sky. Great obese clouds."" Yes. Stupid, obese clouds! They need an education and a healthy diet!
 
Next, chances are that you, Mr. Zusak, are not William Styron or any one of the other small handful of authors that can get away with Holocaust fiction. They've done their research, had some inkling of writing ability, and were able to tell fascinating stories. You invented a fake town in Germany (probably so you didn't have to do any research) and told a long-winded and poorly-written story, and in 500+ pages you couldn't even make it to 1945, so you sloppily dropped off and wrapped it up in 1943. What's the point of writing historical fiction if you can't even stay within the basic confines of that hisotrical event? For me, this does nothing more than trivialize the mass murder of over 6 million people. Maybe that's why a 30 year-old Australian shouldn't write about the Holocaust. But that's just me. Moving on. 
 
But what really makes this book expensive toilet paper is the bad writing which is to be found not just in bizarre descriptions of the weather, but really on every page. Some personal favorites? 
 
""The breakfast colored sun."" 
 
""Somewhere inside her were the souls of words."" 
 
""The oldened young man."" WTF?!!? 
 
""He crawled to a disfigured figure."" 
 
""Her words were motionless."" 
 
""It smelled like friendship."" (Remind me to sniff my friends next time I see them.)

""A multitude of words and sentences were at her fingertips."" (HUH?) 
 
""Pinecones littered the ground like cookies."" 
 
Sigh. 
 
All of this is quite funny coming from a book where the main character supposedly learns the importance of words. Further, I love that the protagonist comes to the conclusion that Hitler ""would be nothing without words."" Really? REALLY? Would Hitler be nothing without WORDS? What about self-loathing, misplaced blame and hatred, an ideology, xenophobia, charisma, an army, and a pride-injured nation willing to listen? Don't those count for something?? 
 
The shit-storm comes to an end when a bomb lands on our fictional town, wiping out everyone save for the sometimes book-thief main character. Of course. Because weak writers who don't know how to end their story just kill everyone off for a clean break and some nice emotional manipulation. Written for maximum tear-jerking effect, our main character spews out some great lines when she sees the death and destruction around her: 
 
To her dead mother, ""God damn it, you were so beautiful."" 
 
To her dead best friend as she shakes him, ""Wake up! I love you! Wake up!"" (Didn't I see the same thing in that movie My Girl?)
 
Then she profoundly notes that her dead father ""...was a man with silver eyes, not dead ones."" 
 
And this kind of angsty adolescent prose just never ended! It went on and on to form the one long-ass, senseless, disjointed story. 
 
But that's ok. Take it all the junk, give it a quirky narrator, an obscure and mysterious title, throw in a Jew on the run from Nazis who likes to draw silly pictures of birds and swastikas, and market it all as Holocaust lit. Ahh, the packaging of bullshit makes for such a sweet best seller. 
 
Swallow it down, America. Put it on the shelf next to The Kite Runner. You love this. You live for this. 
 
SUCKED."
716,Daniel,The Chronicles of Narnia [Box Set] ,"Jul 24, 2009",3,"I read ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" when I was very young, and barely remember it. I never read the other books in the series. So now, as an adult, I'm reading the entire ""Chronicles of Narnia."" After a bit of Internet research, I decided to read them in order of publication, rather than the overall story's chronological order. I'll post individual reviews for each book, and slightly shorter opinions here.

The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: The first in ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is not a bad book, to be sure, but its characters, especially the humans, are a bit bland to stick with the reader once the book is closed. The exception is Edmund Pevensie, who is memorable only because Lewis makes him so unrelentingly obnoxious for almost the entire book. Lewis also draws on myriad old myths, fables and legends to create the hodgepodge that is Narnia, creating little from scratch. The plot of ""Lion"" is a bit creaky, too, with some machinations making little sense on their own, and needed solely to keep the story moving forward. I'm thinking, for example, of the note left behind at Mr. Tumnus's house after he is arrested -- a note that exists only so that the Pevensie children can find out what became of the faun. But some of the touches in Lewis's writing remain fresh almost 60 years after the book was written. Lewis never lets you forget he's telling you a story, occasionally interjecting his own opinions of the characters' doings, and more than once reminding the reader of something that happened in ""the last chapter."" What else makes ""Lion"" intersting to the adult reader? Well, there is, late in the book, some hot girl-on-girl-on-lion action. Sure, C.S. Lewis mostly was writing a religious parable for children, but he threw in some thinly veiled steaminess for his adult readers too. Don't think I don't know what you were doing, Jack. I do. Also, spoiler alert: Aslan is totally Jesus Christ. Full review: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/....

Prince Caspian: Why does C.S. Lewis feel the need, in each ""Chronicles of Narnia"" book, to make one of the Pevensie children, seemingly at random, completely loathsome? In ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" it was Edmund who was a complete dick for almost the entire book, and now, in ""Prince Caspian,"" it's Susan who's asking for a good bitch-slapping. I think I know why C.S. Lewis does this: He's not very good at making characters memorable unless he makes them totally good, totally bad, or start out totally bad and have them turn totally good partway through the story. I know these are children's books, but even children's books can have a little bit of complexity in their characterization, no? Just as in ""Lion,"" none of the characters in ""Caspian"" much deserve to remain in the reader's mind after the book is closed. The possible exception is Trumpkin, and he stands out mostly by using such exclamations as ""lobsters and lollipops"" and ""giants and junipers."" Caspian himself starts out with the potential to become interesting too, but largely fades into the background once the Pevensie children return to Narnia. Getting back to Susan, I do get what C.S. Lewis is trying to do with her character in ""Caspian."" This is still a religious parable, after all, and in this book Susan is the one designated to stop trusting in Aslan, just as someone straying from the Christian faith will stop following Jesus. I get it, but Lewis never bothers telling us why Susan has strayed. That all being said, the story in ""Caspian"" is fast-moving and entertaining, and, just as in ""Lion,"" the writing is lively and engaging. Full review: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/....

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader: The strongest of the three ""Chronicles of Narnia"" books I've read so far, ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" opens with a wonderful first line: ""There was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it."" Eustace, a cousin to the four Pevensie children, who the first two books focused on, is the designated asshole in this entry, taking up the mantle carried by Edmund in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" and Susan in ""Prince Caspian."" I've complained about this trope in my other reviews, but I don't have as much of a problem with it this time around because Eustace is so wonderfully bitchy. With the way he talks about his cousins Edmund and Lucy, as well as the Narnians on board the Dawn Treader, particularly in his diary entries, Eustace comes across as a younger, slightly less gay Noel Coward. Most of ""Voyage"" is comprised of a series of set pieces that demonstrate what a lively imagination C.S. Lewis had: the kidnapping by slave traders, Eustace's transformation into a dragon and back into a boy, the pool that turns whatever touches it to gold, the sea people, and the edge of the world. This is both ""Voyage""'s strength and its weakness: the scenes are inventive, but the overall story is not terribly cohesive. The writing remains strong, and is even a bit better than in the first two books. (There's a funny line early on in the book when the then-bitchy Eustace disappears and Reepicheep, who's none too fond of him, immediately vows to avenge his murder -- apparently hoping he were, in fact, murdered.) Full review: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...

The Silver Chair: ‚ÄúThe Silver Chair‚Äù is in some ways a more mature book than its three predecessors in the Narnia series ‚Äì for one thing, C.S. Lewis finally loses the designated-asshole character I've complained about in my reviews of the preceding books ‚Äì but it also has a less compelling story than the other books. I did find Eustace Scrubb's school, Experiment House, interesting, and wish we had spent a bit more time there before being whisked away to Narnia once again. I also liked the new characters Jill Pole and, especially, Puddleglum, the wonderfully curmudgeonly Marshwiggle who, when pressed, proves himself a hero. The dialog in ""Silver Chair"" isn't quite as witty as in the preceding book in the series, though, and after the entertaining ‚ÄúVoyage of the Dawn Treader,‚Äù its follow-up can't help but be a bit of a letdown. Full review: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...

The Horse and His Boy: I get the sense that other readers of the Narnia books liked ""The Horse and His Boy"" a lot more than I did, with some even citing it as one of their favorites. I found its main characters less interesting than those in the preceding books, and found the biblical allusions -- the parallels between the lives of Shasta and Moses, for example -- a bit overbearing. C.S. Lewis's writing is as strong as ever, but the clever quips and asides are fewer in this volume than I'd come to expect. Full review: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...

The Magician's Nephew: I had a lot more fun with ""The Magician's Nephew"" than I had with its immediate predecessor, partly because its inclusion of people from this world -- something ""The Horse and His Boy"" almost completely lacked -- made it easier to relate to, and partly because the villains, Jadis and Uncle Andrew, have great personalities, broadly drawn though they may be. The recapitulation of Genesis toward the end of the book is pretty heavy-handed, even for C.S. Lewis, but this still was one of the better Narnia books. Full review: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...

The Last Battle: It's been a long, long trip, and I'm glad to finally reach the end. While I enjoyed some of the early installments in the Narnia saga, and several of the characters were compelling (some to love, others to hate), the series overstayed its welcome for me -- even after taking a break halfway through. ""The Last Battle"" started off OK, but suffered mightily as soon as Jesu-- er, Aslan, that is, made his usual appearance. The themes of God vs. Satan, heaven and earth, good vs. evil, and divine perfection vs. earthly imperfection that dominated the latter half of the book are hard to take, even for a reader like me who knew what he was getting into with C.S. Lewis. I can't imagine how children reading this book would react. In the end, I'm glad I finally read the entire series, but I never, ever want to read the Narnia books again.

717,Will Byrnes,The Help,"Sep 29, 2010",4,"The Help is a tale of lines, color, gender and class, in the Jackson, Mississippi of the early 1960s. This is a world in which black women work as domestics in white households and must endure the whims of their employers lest they find themselves jobless, or worse. It is the Jackson, Mississippi where Medgar Evers is murdered, and where spirit and hope are crushed daily. It is the Jackson, Mississippi where Freedom Riders are taken from a bus, a place where segregation and racism are core beliefs and where challenge to the status quo is met with resistance, to the point of violence. It is a time of political turmoil on the national stage, as the civil rights movement is picking up steam. It is also a place where using the wrong bathroom could get a black person beaten to death. 


Kathryn Stockett -image from The Telegraph

 The Help sees this world through three sets of eyes, Aibeleen, a fifty-something black woman who has taken care of many white children and is beginning again with a newborn. Minny, in her thirties, has troubles enough at home, with an abusive, drunken husband and several children of her own, but her inability to control her tongue has led to a series of jobs and a series of firings. Skeeter is a young white woman, newly graduated from college, and eager to pursue a career in writing. Skeeter has grown a conscience and no longer accepts the presumptions of the past. She yearns to know what happened to Constantine, the black woman who was so important to her as a child. Skeeter sees the unfairness of the social structure. She engages Aibeleen, Minny and a host of other black domestic workers to tell their stories for a book, hoping to expose the hypocrisy and cruelty of Jackson‚Äôs white society. 

The story not only places the events in historical context, but offers a taste of what it must have been like for the Aibeleens, Minnys and Skeeters of the time. Stockett has created living, breathing characters, people you can relate to, cheer and cry for. If there is softness here, it is that the devils are painted in glaring red, which may be an accurate portrayal of the time, but makes for a melodramatic feel at times. The heroines are fully realized. We get a sense of how they came to be the way they are. While we are offered some background on the baddies, it is not enough to make them as completely human as the three narrators. 

The Help is a powerful, moving read, blessed with a colorful, believable cast of characters, a compelling setting and an eternal message of shared humanity, a knockout of a first novel.

719,Lee  (the Book Butcher),Chronicles of Narnia Movie Tie-in Box Set The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"Apr 16, 2021",4,"One of my favorite series growing up. Very formative to me as it combined a love of fantasy with my religious upbringing. wanted to check out it's affects on me since I'm not Christian anymore.

The chronicles of Narnia strikes me now as a unique series. its probably base on a old-school chronicles format i do not recognize because my lack of college education. Not only does C.S Lewis push Christian ideology over commercial appeal. Which oddly enough lead to lasting commercial success. But he has a rotating cast of human characters from our world in the four Pevensie children, their cousin Eustace his friend Jill Pole uncle Digory and his friend Polly Plummer. along with many Narnian native like prince Caspian, the white witch, Reepicheep and my favorite Puddleglum. The only constant character in the book is Aslan the lion. the Narnian world is also very well developed probably a side affect of Lewis being friend with J.R.R Tolkien. Lewis takes you to other kingdoms, across the eastern sea, and to the underworld. Also spans the whole expanse of time in narnia from creation to destruction. Which is a really neat concept for a series. There's so much good in here magic, honor, valor, and friendship lots of lessons taught in this series. Great for kids and adults alike. a lot to like here and the Christian symbolism is only overt in certain book. i never found it to be distracting. but can see how others would. this series hit some nostalgia points but i am surprised how much i did not remember. The sixth book in particular the silver chair i did not remember at all.

Recommend to everyone young and old, Christian or not, fantasy or non fiction reader. i have encountered few people who did not at least like the lion, witch, and the wardrobe. so if your interested in literary history or good worldbuilding enter the granddaddy of portal fantasy the chronicles of Narnia."
720,Dana Ilie,The Help,"Jun 18, 2018",5,"There is a lot to like about this book. It is easy to be drawn in by the storyline and the characters and it‚Äôs a pretty fast read. It‚Äôs a historical time-period I‚Äôve been really interested, and I thought the portrayal of the events and the relationships were pretty accurately done.

The characters are really well done ‚Äì they‚Äôre all pretty different and easy to tell apart, and they‚Äôre all so likable in their own real, sometimes prickly ways.

And I was impressed by the fairly even-handedness of the topic that Stockett managed. She didn‚Äôt make one group out to be saints or one group demons. There are good and bad and goodish-baddish people on every side of the issue, and each has different motivations and reasons for being where they are on that side ‚Äì hate, pride, naivete, personal experiences.
Three reasons why I love The Help:

It‚Äôs funny. It is not a comedy but some lines just had me wanting to read on and on!
It is easy to read. Even though The Help talks about a very serious time in American history, the author really thought about how to write the story in a way that it just flows.
I really felt a connection with each of the characters. You get to know them from their point of view. Even though the story is through Miss Skeeter‚Äôs mindset for most of the novel, Stockett provides insight into the brain and life of both Minny and Aibileen."

722,Mayra,The Outsiders,"Nov 02, 2013",5,"Expectations scare me. I had heard so many wonderful things about this book. And it‚Äôs never a good idea to expect too much, because that‚Äôs such a big opportunity for disappointment. So I always prefer to know the least amount possible about any book I‚Äôm interested in. However, the insurmountable praise for The Outsiders has always been tough to evade. It‚Äôs everywhere.

I found that the quality of this book was perfectly evidenced by the fact that the immense expectation and build-up accumulated throughout the years were so well met by the actual classic worthiness of the story and the way it was told.

Loved the simple, original narrative. Great, real, well-developed, relatable characters.

This book is heartwarming and heartbreaking... so prepare your heart for the exercise."
723,Anne,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Sep 16, 2019",5,"I should probably admit that most of what I thought I knew about Dorian Gray came from pop culture references. In my defense, I'm actively trying to branch out and read more than comics and trashy romance novels, but it's slow going and I've got a lot of catching up to do.
Shockingly, I didn't bother to read the blurb, and it turns out this was a bit more complex than I thought it would be.



Point is, I had no idea it was about gay dudes!
And I'm always thinking that the guys in classic novels seem kinda gay, but then everyone tells me no, men were just more sensitive back then, and I just sorta pretend to believe them and we all go on about our day.
But there's no way that's the case here.



Anyway, I said that to say this: this book was waaaay more interesting than I thought it was going to be when I first decided to read it.
I mean, having to hide that you're in love with someone is awful no matter what the reason, but potentially getting tossed in the clink and having your life ruined because people think it's wrong is a whole other level of horrible.
Poor Basil! My heart just went out to that guy! He was so decent and so sweet. And yet somehow his love for Dorian, so pure it created a painting that seemed to capture the essence of Dorian's soul, became twisted by Lord Henry's influencing Dorian to desire youth and beauty above all else.
Enter the wacky Crayola curse!



And the really sad thing was that Dorian wasn't evil in the beginning. Selfish and silly, yes. But not truly bad. Which made watching him slip slowly at first, then eventually plunge headlong into villainy, even more tragic. The longer you live the easier it is to see what a slippery slope life can be, and how one bad choice left uncorrected can lead to far worse things.



The only one who escaped relatively unscathed was the instigator, Henry. 
And isn't that just the way it always goes?
There's always that fucking asshole who sets shit into motion and then steps aside to watch everyone else flail around in the mess they've created.
Albeit, this time around it was a bit of a supernatural mess...



This is one of the few classics that I've found to be meaty, interesting, and still has characters that ring true.
Loved it! 

 
This is the cover of the audiobook I listened to which was published by Author's Republic and narrated by John Gonzalez.
 <--if you see this version, swerve to avoid!

  

I've had great luck in general with classic audiobooks, but this was the exception to the rule. It seemed to me as though the narrator almost stumbled over words sometimes, and beyond that, the reading was just sort of off."
724,Heather's Mum,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Sep 09, 2007",5,"Who can resist the charm of J. R. R. Tolkien's brave little hairy toed Hobbits, awesome Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn, Tom Bombadil, Elf-lord Glorfindel, Half-elven lord Elrond, beautiful Arwen, Boromir, Lady Galadriel, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Elf.

Tolkien describes Hobbits: ""I picture a fairly human figure, not a kind of fairy rabbit as some of my British reviewers seem to fancy: fattish in the stomach, shortish in the leg. A round, jovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'; hair short and curling (brown). The feet from the ankles down, covered with brown hairy fur. Clothing: green velvet breeches; red or yellow waistcoat; brown or green jacket; gold (or brass) buttons; a dark green hood and cloak (belonging to a dwarf)."" 

Even Hobbit names are whimsical and bring on a smile. 
Bilbo Baggins 
Frodo Baggins 
Samwise ""Sam"" Gamgee 
Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck 
Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took 
Fredegar ""Fatty"" Bolger

Recipe for IRREPRESSIBLE, SPELL-BINDING literary entertainment:

Find featured, always hungry Hobbits in hobbit-holes in a Shire and/or at Birthday celebration. Mix with good & bad Wizards, Elves, Dwarves, a magical gold ring everyone wants, Orcs, terrifying Ringwraiths, a once ""of hobbit-kind"" creature called Gollum, a demon Balrog, a giant spider named Shelob, tree-like Ents, Humans, huge elephant-like Oliphaunts and Trolls. Then throw in lots of adventures, battles, magic, love, death, humor, loyalty, friendship, tears and fear. Arrange all ingredients to make the reader stay up for days... unwilling to do anything but read the next sentence, next paragraph, next page, next chapter, then next book until you finally wave goodbye to Bilbo, Frodo, Gandolph and the elves as they ... read the books and find out!!"

726,Emily May,Little Women,"Dec 04, 2013",1,"Never liked this one. I read Alcott back around the time I was first reading the Brontes and Dickens, and her books always struck me as incredibly dull in comparison. I was probably about 12, though, so I suppose I should try it again someday."
727,Virginia Ronan ‚ô• Herondale ‚ô•,The Outsiders,"Nov 05, 2018",4,"‚ÄùSixteen years on the streets and you can learn a lot. But all the wrong things, not the things you want to learn. Sixteen years on the streets and you see a lot. But all the wrong sights, not the sights you want to see.‚Äù

So this was my first time reading ‚ÄúThe Outsiders‚Äù and I really don‚Äôt get why our teachers never forced us to read THIS book at school! I‚Äôm convinced my teenage me wouldn‚Äôt only have approved but also would have enjoyed it immensely and I‚Äôm kinda sad I had to discover this book so late. Well, my school system obviously failed but that definitely didn‚Äôt stop me from reading ‚ÄúThe Outsiders‚Äù and I‚Äôm very glad about it. 

Soda threw one arm across my neck. He mumbled something drowsily. ‚ÄúListen, kiddo, when Darry hollers at you ‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt mean nothin‚Äô. He‚Äôs just got more worries than somebody his age ought to.‚Äù

I swear the moment I read about the interactions and relationships between those boys I was already hooked! It felt like reading ‚ÄúThe Raven Boys‚Äù all over again; just a couple of years earlier, with other troubles and with a smaller book size. XD I mean alone the fact that Ponyboy and Soda were sleeping together in a bed! Their brotherly relationship was so nice to read! Those brothers cared about each other and their friends and they would have done almost everything in order to help them! <3

He was stroking my hair and I could hear the sobs racking him as he fought to keep back the tears. ‚ÄúOh, Pony, I thought we‚Äôd lost you ‚Ä¶ like we did Mom and Dad ‚Ä¶‚Äù That was his silent fear then ‚Äì of losing another person he loved. 

Darry, the oldest of those three brothers, broke my heart as well. I mean their parents were dead and he had to look after his two younger brothers. I can‚Äôt even imagine how much strength it takes to take care of your brothers at such a young age, but he still did it and was even successful. He got a job and looked after them and this alone makes him a hero in my eyes. Who knows; if Johnny and Dallas would have had such family ties they probably would have never even ended up where they did in the end. >_< Johnny‚Ä¶ that poor little boy! He didn‚Äôt deserve what happened to him and it‚Äôs no wonder he was so jumpy after the ‚ÄúSocs‚Äù almost beat him to death. I‚Äôm right there with Ponyboy when he says that it‚Äôs not fair that they were jumped for being ‚ÄúGreasers‚Äù. 

It wasn‚Äôt fair for the Socs to have everything. We were as good as they were; it wasn‚Äôt our fault we were greasers. I couldn‚Äôt just take it or leave it, like Two-Bit, or ignore it and love life anyway, like Sodapop, or harden myself beyond caring, like Dally, or actually enjoy it, like Tim Shepard. I felt the tension growing inside of me and I knew something had to happen or I would explode. ‚Äú

The interesting thing about this book is that it acknowledges the fact that the ‚ÄúSocs‚Äù fight the ‚ÄúGreasers‚Äù because they think they are lowlives, but that none of those two parties actually wants to do anything against it. They accept this injustice, it‚Äôs just a part of their life and they all act like they are supposed to fight because it‚Äôs only natural. The only three people who truly question their situation are Pony, Johnny and Randy. In one way or the other they are all tired of fighting and try their best to get out of that vicious cycle ‚Äì some more effective than others. >_< 

‚ÄùStay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Oh my, that line killed me big time! T_T I had a lot of mixed feelings about that ending and I could relate to Ponyboy so much. He was confused, he knew what they had been doing wasn‚Äôt right, that the fighting didn‚Äôt get them anywhere; that his friend was in trouble because he had done something right and something awfully wrong and that sooner or later he would have to pay for it. I think this book is such a damn good example for humanity. It points out that good people are able to do horrible things and that seemingly bad people aren‚Äôt always as bad as they seem to appear. They have their problems and troubles too and there is always a reason why they leash out at others, why they act in a certain way. 

‚ÄùWe‚Äôre all we‚Äôve got left. We ought to be able to stick together against everything. If we don‚Äôt have each other we don‚Äôt have anything. If you don‚Äôt have anything, you end up like Dallas ‚Ä¶‚Äù

They are all human, whether it are ‚ÄúSocs‚Äù or ‚ÄúGreasers‚Äù, they all just want to live their lives, they want to be happy and accepted for who they are and in the end they actually aren‚Äôt as different as they seem to be. It‚Äôs an epiphany us readers experience while we read this book, but it‚Äôs a lesson not all of the characters learn. >_<

To say it with Martin Luther King Jr. words:
‚ÄúHate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness.‚Äù

And I think this quote describes the book more than just well. The ending made me sad, because there‚Äôs only one way this could have ended and it was exactly the way I expected it to be. Not all of it, but most of it anyway. 

Conclusion:
If you haven‚Äôt read ‚ÄúThe Outsiders‚Äù yet, you definitely should give it a try! It‚Äôs a great book which teaches an important lesson and I can recommend it to everyone. This book will make you think and feel and it will continue to do so even after you finished reading the last page. ;-)"
728,Liz S.,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Aug 01, 2007",2,"I recently read The Time-Traveler's Wife and was pretty disappointed---the author somehow manages to turn such an awesome premise (the dude actually time travels!) into something pretty flat and dull. The first hundred pages really hooked me, but after a while I started to get irritated by:

1. All the name checking of hipster-approved bands in an attempt to establish Henry's supposed ""punk"" cred. He liked the Violent Femmes in 1991. That's why he's so badass? Seriously?

2. The food porny descriptions of the meals they eat. Some paragraphs read like the menu of a pretentious bistro.

3. The awful ethnic stereotypes that characterize the few non-white characters (Nell, the mammy-esque family cook (complete with dialect), or Charisse, the ""childlike"" Filipina).

4. The fact that everyone is successful and at least upper middle class, if not fabulously wealthy. Even Henry somehow manages to keep his job at the Newberry library for 20 years, despite his habits of disappearing for odd stretches of time, not keeping appointments, and, oh, running around naked in the stacks from time to time. It would have been more interesting to me if his disorder kept him from having any normal kind of professional life.

5. The lack of character development in the protagonists after they finally meet as adults. 
All of a sudden, they meet and they're in love. The author gives lip service to Henry's womanizing and drug problems, but really, they don't seem to pose much more than a passing problem for Clare because she already knows they'll get married. And even as a married couple, their biggest source of conflict (whether they can or should have a child) is extrinsic, rather than intrinsic to their personalities/characters. Clare never really seems to be bothered by her lack of independence, or the fact that she's so tethered to Henry because he had a part in making her who she is, etc.

By the time I actually got to the end of the story, I was too emotionally distanced from the characters to really be moved by what happens to them---the burden of plot winds up outsripping any kind of nuanced characterization. Bad science fiction and bad romance. Bah humbug."
729,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),The Catcher in the Rye,"May 06, 2020",4,"There are some areas in this book that we might question the actions of Holden, especially if we reread this book after we have grown up.

‚ÄúThe mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.‚Äù"
730,ryan,The Da Vinci Code ,"Apr 17, 2007",5,"most of us have heard of this controverisal book. it takes an open minded person to read this and to remember it is just fiction. but it brings up a lot of important questions about the Christian church, and the loss of paganism and the respect of the Goddess or the Woman. 

I don't care if I am the only one who likes this book. it is my own truth, and i will think what i want to think. Dan Brown didn't LEAD me or anyone else. he OPENED our minds. simply and importantly...he was just a catalyst for different thinking. that is a good thing...poorly written or not.

if you finish the book you will notice that Dan Brown even makes it clear to readers through his characters words, that he doesn't want to destroy christianity because it has done so much good for so many people, and if it works for them, let's let them continue to do what works for them. but find your own path. 

if you were or are a Christian ask yourself about the topics in this book. They are so eye opening. Jesus having a baby? totally possible...never thought of it before. never thought of it. is it true? who knows. Things like this are happening all the time today...Weapons of Mass destruction in Iraq? sound familiar? Maybe the church repressed information LIKE this because it was a threat to the church. totally possible. The catholic church creating the biblical canon with a political agenda to wipe out paganism? actually this seems to be a fact. women being oppressed due to the fear of religous zealot men in power losing their power...never looked at it that way. but this seems to be a fact too. is it helpful in broadening my perspective of the fact that christianity is just a religion made by fallible people. it sure is. does it open my mind to other faiths like paganism, judiasm, islam, bhuddism, and want to take the truths from all of them, and then THINK FOR MYSELF and figure out my own truth. it sure does...and that is what this book has probably done for many other people. why do you think Dan Brown's book was on the bestseller list for so long...and became a movie...obviously it was doing some good."

732,Zo√´,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone ,"Jun 06, 2012",5,I will never ever rate this lower than 5 stars. BEAUTIFUL.
733,Aubrey,Les Mis√©rables,"Aug 07, 2010",5,"Let's say that I could choose a single book with the guarantee that every man, woman, and child would read it. I would not choose my top three favorites, nor would I choose the one whose remnants are permanently inked upon me. I would choose this one. You argue, the length! The time period! The cultural barriers! It's just another long expounding by some old dead white guy whose type has suffocated literature for centuries! Women will be frustrated with poor representation, people who aren't white will be angered by no representation, and everyone will bored to tears! Alright, I see that. Now, let me explain.

Human rights have not been perfected. They are as much a work in progress now as they were 150 years ago when this book was first published. If you wish to find the book that gives every variation on the theme of humanity its due, it does not exist, and in all likelihood never will. With that in mind, it is this book that I choose, as while Victor Hugo may have been limited by the era he grew up in, he did a damn good job in dreaming beyond it. He wrote what he knew, but he also wrote what he hoped, and together they form a piece of writing that can mean something to everyone, whatever their life consists of.

The book is called 'The Miserables'. I have a feeling that it is the blatant despair that this title provokes that has dissuaded publishers from rendering it into English, instead keeping it in that slightly prettier to the ear French form. It can even be shortened to that chic and oh so clever 'Les Mis', as is the norm whenever the play is discussed. In that light, when you say that truncated phrase it brings to mind not the triumphant book in its majestic entirety, but the abridged version, or perhaps the even more abridged play. You think of the story, but you do not think of the author's ideas, ones that he devotes full chapters to and are just as important to this tome as the characters he has sent running through it. And this is a tragedy.

Is tragedy too harsh a word? I don't think so. The book itself is one where tragedy heavily outweighs every other emotional aspect, and reducing it to a pittance of itself is flat out disgraceful. You have countless flavors of human sorrow worked out here: imprisonment, ostracization, slavery, decay of health, decay of morals, decay of life through the brutality of war as well as the slow grind of society‚Äôs wheels. There are also the more subtle restrictions on the human spirit, propagated by a firmness of belief that slowly stagnates into constricting bigotry, where humans substitute bias for their reality and confine themselves to a small and mean existence. These confines are more difficult to escape from than the strongest chains, which may bend and break under pressure, whereas prejudices will turn in on themselves and feed on the opposition. It is these barriers that build the barricades, it is these walls that let slip the dogs of war, it is these restrictions that make someone relish petty glories gained in the downfall of their fellow human beings. Where a difference of opinion exists, there will be conflict, and Victor Hugo was intimately familiar with the facets of this violent mechanism.

He did not want this for the world. More specifically, he did not want this for his France, his Paris, his creative beacon that teems with contagious culture and ridiculous fashions to this very day, one that can be silly but is often so very, very brave. Like Gavroche the gamin, it thumbs its nose at the world and thinks it slow and stupid, but all the same it loves its fellow human beings, and lives for the times when it can lead them, striding forward towards that thing called Progress. Victor Hugo loved the concept of Progress, and he wished that everyone would love it as well. In his words:
Go on, philosophers‚Äîteach, enlighten, kindle, think aloud, speak up, run joyfully toward broad daylight, fraternize in the public squares, announce the glad tidings, lavish your alphabets, proclaim human rights, sing your Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, tear off green branches from the oak trees. Make thought a whirlwind.
He sent his characters off with this dream of Progress, of finding a life for themselves, of living in a world that bettered itself by the passing day, where the future was not dreary but vibrant and brimming with unlimited potential. Many of them do not succeed. Many fall by the wayside, desiccated by sickness, shot down in wars, slain by grief and the resignation that life is not so much better than death. Some survive in miserable conditions, as restricted by their morality as by a chain around their neck. Some survive only by having stripped their morality as easily as a snake sheds its skin, and in the conditions, who can blame them? The weight of society squeezes the supports, and one is so much lighter and flexible without cumbersome thoughts of being good and kind.

In all this sadness and life cut short by miserable conditions long before its time, there is still hope. Victor Hugo illustrated this in his diverging sections as thoroughly as he did in his main story, as hard as that may be to believe. It is true, though. For example, his section on the Battle of Waterloo seems no more than an endless list of casualties, pages of warfare and tactics, and death, so much death. But at the very end, he points out it is not this battle that we remember in so much detail, nor any that came before it. We remember literature. In Hugo‚Äôs words:
Nowadays when Waterloo is merely a click of sabers, above Bl√ºcher Germany has Goethe, and above Wellington England has Byron.
And what of the other sections? There are many, but two that are particularly powerful in their own subtle ways are the sections on argot and the sewers. Argot is the language of criminals disguising their speech from the ignorant and the all too interested. It is an ever-changing labyrinth of slang, idioms, innuendos, wordplay that whips itself into more contorted evolutions in its effort to escape the law. If this kind of creativity runs rampant on the street, how would it fare if given a warm place to sleep, three meals a day, and a chance to improve its station in life? And the sewers. When first described, they are dirty, desperate, despicable things that do nothing but spread filth and disease and provide a home for the equally depraved. This however was Hugo‚Äôs vision of how it had been in the past. In his time, they were clean and meticulous in their function, as well designed as the streets above and ten times as useful. If humans can so improve the lot of that out of sight contraption that carries their shit, imagine what they could do with the parts of life that are meant for open viewing and enjoyment.

One last mention. Victor Hugo‚Äôs prose has been accused of excessive flouncing about, rambling sentences that quickly devolve into meaningless lists without form or function beyond the enjoyment of their own existence. I say, isn‚Äôt that last part enough? Reading his sentences brings to mind a dance, an endless waltz, to a symphony that builds and builds to a final crescendo, for Hugo is very good at taking his countless paragraphs and using them to reach a final glorious message. He could have said it plainly, but it would not have been nearly as powerful without all the exposition; just as his point about the memory of Byron outliving the memory of Waterloo would not have been nearly as striking had he not gone through the motions of describing every minute detail of that terrible battle. To bring the reader to his level of understanding and to make them feel as much as he does about these things, the prose is essential. And frankly, I have yet to come across another author that is as joyous to read as he is, for even while he is going on and on about useless trivia from a time long past, his enthusiasm is contagious. He loved what he wrote about, and he wanted you to love it too, progressing sentences growing more and more triumphant much like the Progress he wished for mankind. An ideal where all, I repeat, all are allowed to flourish and grow, developing their own ideas while more importantly learning to accept those of others, where a stretch of one's limb doesn't require the injury or confinement of another's.

So, read the full version, if you can. You‚Äôre welcome to the other, shorter versions, but read the full one at least once in your lifetime. Read the introduction even, for in this particular edition there is a wonderful amount of detail about Victor Hugo‚Äôs life that brings the book into beautiful focus. The introduction also calls the abridged version insufficient, and says:
It is almost impossible to predict the individual detail, the flashing image or human quirk precisely observed, that will burn its way into a reader‚Äôs mind for good.
I cannot agree more.

And lastly, for the tl;dr'ers, a summary for what I have said above, which rests within the very first pages of the book:
So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom, a social condemnation which, in the midst of civilization, artificially creates a hell on earth, and complicates with human fatality a destiny that is divine; so long as the three problems of the century‚Äîthe degradation of man by the exploitation of his labor, the ruin of woman by starvation, and the atrophy of childhood by physical and spiritual night‚Äîare not solved; so long as, in certain regions, social asphyxia shall be possible; in other words, and from a still broader point of view, so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, there should be a need for books such as this. 
‚ÄìHauteville House, 1862"
734,Matthew,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Jan 08, 2013",3,"Not sure what it was about this book that made me not like it as much as I was hoping. When I was growing up I remember watching the BBC TV show and playing the text adventure on my Commodore 64 (yes, I am getting old). Before I actually read it, lots of my friends recommended it and the cool, edgy people all loved it (basically, the hipsters of the 90s! üòâ)

When I finally read it, it seemed a bit dry to me. Perhaps that was the famous dry British humor? Also, it felt like Adams was trying to include a joke in every sentence. I started to think that perhaps the TV show and the text adventure streamlined the humor and made it more accessible to me.

I do think that a lot of people will like this one and sing its praises - and you don't even need to be cool and edgy! But if you like your British humor in controlled, coherent doses, you may have the same experience as me."
735,Lyndsey,1984,"Jan 06, 2011",5,"YOU. ARE. THE. DEAD. Oh my God. I got the chills so many times toward the end of this book. It completely blew my mind. It managed to surpass my high expectations AND be nothing at all like I expected. Or in Newspeak ""Double Plus Good.""

Let me preface this with an apology. If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review, I can't help it. My mind is completely fried.

This book is like the dystopian Lord of the Rings, with its richly developed culture and economics, not to mention a fully developed language called Newspeak, or rather more of the anti-language, whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it. The world-building is so fully fleshed out and spine-tinglingly terrifying that it's almost as if George travelled to such a place, escaped from it, and then just wrote it all down.

I read Fahrenheit 451 over ten years ago in my early teens. At the time, I remember really wanting to read 1984, although I never managed to get my hands on it. I'm almost glad I didn't. Though I would not have admitted it at the time, it would have gone over my head. Or at the very least, I wouldn't have been able to appreciate it fully.

From the start, the author manages to articulate so many of the things I have thought about but have never been able to find a way to put into words. Even in the first few chapters I found myself having to stop just to quietly consider the words of Mr Orwell.

For instance, he talks about how the act of writing itself is a type of time travel. It is communicating with the future. I write these words now, but others may not discover them for hours, weeks, or even years. For me, it is one time. For you the reader, it is an entirely different one.

Just the thought that reading and writing could one day be outlawed just shivers my timbers. I related to Winston so much in that way. I would have found a way to read or write.

The politics and psychology of this novel run deep. The society in the book has no written laws, but many acts are punishable by death. The slogan of the Party (War is Peace...) is entirely convoluted. Individuality is frowned upon and could lead to being labeled a traitor to the Party.

I also remember always wondering why the title was 1984. I was familiar with the concept of Big Brother and wondered why that wasn't the name of the book. In the story, they don't actually know what year it is because so much of the past has been erased by the Ministry of Truth. It could very easily have been 1981. I think that makes the title more powerful. Something as simple as the year or date is unknown to these people. They have to believe it is whatever day that they are told it is. They don't have the right to keep track. Knowledge is powerful. Knowledge is necessary. But according to Big Brother. Ignorance is strength.

1984 is written in past tense and has long paragraphs of exposition, recounting events, and explaining the society. These are usually things that distance me from a book and from the characters, but Orwell managed to keep me fully enthralled. He frequently talks in circles and ideas are often repeated but it is still intriguing, none the less. I must admit that I zoned out a bit while Winston was reading from The Book, but I was very fascinated by the culture.

Sometimes it seems as though the only way to really experience a characters emotions is through first person. This is not the case with this book, as it is written in third person; yet, I never failed to be encompassed in Winston's feelings. George manages to ensure that the reader never feels disconnected from the events that are unfolding around them, with the exception of the beginning when Winston is just starting to become awakened. I developed a strong attachment to Winston and thrived on living inside his mind. I became a member of the Thought Police, hearing everything, feeling everything and last but not least, (what the Thought Police are not allowed to do) questioning everything.

I wasn't expecting a love story in this book, but the relationship between Julia and Winston was truly profound. I enjoyed it even more than I would have expected and thought the moments between them were beautiful. I wasn't sure whether he was going to eventually betray Julia to the Party or not, but I certainly teared up often when it came to their relationship.

George has an uncanny ability to get to the base of the human psyche, at times suggesting that we need to be at war for many different reasons, whether it's at war with ourselves or with others. That is one thing I have never understood: why humans feel the need to destroy and control each other.

It seems that the main and recurring message in this book is about censorship and brainwashing. One, censorship, is limited and little exposure to ideas of the world; the other, brainwashing, is forced and too much exposure to a certain ideas. Both can be extremely dangerous.

Inside the ministry of Truth, he demonstrates the dangers of censorship by showing how the Party has completely rewritten the past by forging and abolishing documents and physical evidence. We also spend quite a bit of time with Winston in the Ministry of Love, where the brainwashing takes place. Those who commit thoughtcrime are tortured until they grow to love and obey Big Brother and serve only the interests of the Party.

A common theme occurred to me throughout the book, although it wasn't necessarily referenced consistently. The good of the many is more important than the good of the one. There are so many variables when it comes to this statement and for the most part it seems natural to say, ""Of course, the many is more important than the one"", but when inside Winston's head, all that I began to care about was his well-being and not if he was able to help disband or conquer the Party and Big Brother. I just wanted him to be at peace. 

Whether or not the good of all is more important than that of the one, I can't answer. I think most people feel their own happiness is more important than the rest of the world's, and maybe that's part of the problem but it's also human nature. I only wish we could all accept one other regardless of belief and culture and not try to force ways of life onto other people. Maybe I'm naive for thinking that way, but so be it.

I almost don't know what to think about this book. I'm not even sure my brain still works, or if it ever worked right at all. This book has a way of making you think you know exactly what you believe about everything and then turning you completely upside down and making you question whether or not you believe anything at all about anything. It's the strangest thing. Hmmm. Doublethink? Perhaps. Perhaps not.

Everything about this book is captivating. It's groundbreaking yet at the same time, purely classic. Ahead of its time, yet timeless. From Big Brother to the Thought Police, I was hooked and wanted to know more about it all.

Basically, I think everyone should read 1984 at some point. You really have to be in the mood to work at reading it, though. But it's all worth it in the end. It's absolutely incredible and I loved it. I don't re-read many books but this will definitely be one of them. It is a hard read, but more importantly, it is a MUST read."
736,Anne,Brave New World,"Jun 01, 2021",2,"I think I read it wrong. 
Because my first thought upon finishing this was this: 
Where the hell do I sign up for this Brave New World?
Basically, this society is missing religion, shame, sin, misery, fear, disease, and classic books.

 

Now, that's not to say life is perfect in this utopia.
Nobody gets married and has kids anymore. I know, a lot of you are thinking that isn't quite the downside that the book thinks it is. No more monogamy? Gasp. Whatever would we do?



The new people are grown in test tubes. There are the dumb ones who do the menial shit, the average ones who do the office stuff, and the smarter ones who run the show. After being conditioned genetically, everyone is raised in state-run lab/home/school facilities, brainwashed in their sleep, and given a teeny bit of shock therapy in the toddler years to ensure that folks are content with their lot in life. 



 Can you imagine if people were actually set up to be in charge by nothing more than a coincidence of birth?
Gosh. That's some crazy sci-fi caste shenanigans right there.

 

So what we have here is job security, free drugs that don't have side effects and make you feel good, non-judgemental sex, no conflict, no health issues till you die, and no barky religious folks knocking on your door at 9 am on a Saturday.
And what are you missing out on, pray tell? Shakespeare.
I've read his stuff, and I can say without a doubt that I could skip it and make do with a Micheal Bay movie. Fair warning, no one has ever accused me of being someone they aspire to emulate.



Even the evil overlord in charge of it all wasn't that bad of a dude. When these guys met him and confronted him with their doubts as to how well they actually enjoyed their place in society, he just sent them to an island full of like-minded individuals so they could do what they wanted without disrupting the flow of things. He was kind of like, yeah, this isn't for everyone and sent them off with a wave of his chill hand.

 

For the entire book, I kept waiting for the Soylent Green is People moment, but it never really came. To me, that world did not appear worse than ours in any significant way. The only weird thing was that being a mother or father was shameful and no one was monogamous. That's not exactly the most horrifying thing I've ever heard happening in a dystopian novel.

  

Especially if the other option is to be like John, who flogged himself every time he got a boner over cute little Lenina. On a related note, the part where he kept yelling 
STRUMPET! STRUMPET! STRUUUUMPET!
 had me laughing until the tears rolled down my face. I kept waiting for some sort of redemption arc for this savage wherein he stopped being a complete asshat, but that didn't happen. He was creepy as fuck right up till the end.
And what an ending it was.
(view spoiler)[So John has had enough of polite society and runs out to some deserted little strip of land. Once there, he prays to some weird mash-up of Christian and Native American gods, flogs himself daily, and tries his darndest to make his life as hard and unbearable as he can. Because suffering for no reason whatsoever is what makes life good?
Bottom line, he's so batshit that tourists start showing up at his doorstep to watch him act the fool. But it's not till Lenina gets there and tries to embrace him that he loses his damn mind. He tries to attack her with his nasty little flogger and when he doesn't succeed, he just starts beating the fuck out of himself. And if that wasn't weird enough, he AND all the tourists end up getting turned on by his self-flagellation and have a massive orgy. 
John wakes up after his night of debauchery, can't deal with having busted a nut, and hangs himself.
The end. (hide spoiler)]
If you drew random scenarios out of a hat and put them down on paper in no particular order, you seriously could not have come up with a more bananas conclusion to this book.



I'm still not sure what the moral of the story is here. Now, admittedly, I like the sound of the drugs and sex and fun holidays. I will say I think it was a bit of overkill to taze babies.
Then again, sacrifices must be made for the greater good. 



I'm kidding! Don't zap toddlers, you idiot.
Ok. At the end of the day, I didn't really care for this book. I personally thought it was sort of boring. Not much happened plotwise and I never really felt invested in any of the characters. It seemed (to me) a bit of a daffy book that had a lot of fuckwit ideas of what would happen if we ignore the strict moral codes about sex found in most religions.
I know this is a beloved novel and I don't think you're stupid if you enjoyed it. Different strokes for different folks and all that.

As charming as she is Anne of Green Gables makes you fall in love with her not for her wit, but for her wholehearted love of life and the beauty of this world. She hates and loves with intense power for a little girl. I cried and smiled often during this story and I am so glad I finally read it."
740,Sean Barrs,Les Mis√©rables,"Jan 17, 2014",4,"I saw the movie version of this before reading it and I was utterly shook by the powerful nature of the story. When I read it I hoped for the same experience, instead I had one more powerful. In life there are few truly great men: there are few men that are truly and incorruptibly good. Jean Valjean is such a man; he is a paragon of goodliness: he is a superb character. 

At the beginning of the novel he sacrifices everything: he steals a loaf of bread knowing full well of the consequences. He risks his freedom in order to save his starving family; he risks his mortality and his morality: he risks everything. He is a truly selfless man, a great man. And what are the consequences for trying to save a starving boy? What is the justice of the land? 

Imprisonment. 

Servitude. 

Pure Corruption. 

 

In this the author captures social injustice in its most brutal form; he shows the foolishness of unbending laws, of a system that refuses to open its eyes, and how the common man will always suffer under the yolk of the powerful. But, somehow, Valjean just about retains his decency and his humanity. Somehow in the face of sadistic ruling, he manages to remain Valjean; he even manages to better himself and improve the world around him. Yes, he makes a mistake that leads to the death of an innocent; yes, he was responsible for the snuffing of the life he ignored. However, he redeems himself in a truly extraordinary way, and eventually pays an even greater sacrifice. The world needs more men like Valjean.

Then if that wasn‚Äôt enough, Valjean even offers his nemesis forgiveness. He sees Javert for the product of society that he is; he looks at him and only sees pity rather than hatred, which would have been a much easier emotion to experience. Valjean does what few men would have the strength to do, and in the process shows his true inner-strength. Javert was fully responsible for his actions. He is a pitiable character. To his cold, singular, narrow-minded, law based logic, Valjean was a simple criminal. Nothing more, nothing less. Javert cannot look beyond the surface. He dedicated his life to preventing this villain form getting away. In this, he is as much a victim as Valjean. When he eventually realises the true errors of his ways, he is broken. He is no more. Javert is not the real villain: it is society. 

 

And this is only one aspect of this superb novel. Javert and Valjean are not the only victims of this novel. Pushed aside, forgotten about, is the miserable Fantine. She represents the tragic state of women‚Äôs place in such a society. No one cares about her. She is just another woman in the street, another countless victim of misrule: someone to be trampled over. But, Valjean shows that life isn‚Äôt completely dark. From such corruption, a heart can remain true to itself and continue beating."
741,Melissa ‚ô• Dog/Wolf Lover ‚ô• Martin,The Outsiders,"Aug 27, 2016",5,"I have watched this movie over and over when I was younger and I still have it today and love it just as much. I will admit I was in love with Dallas and had a crush on Sodapop but Dallas was my man =)



I just can't believe it took me this many years to read the book! And the book was so close to the movie it is almost unreal. Maybe it was due to the fact that S.E. Hinton was on set helping with the movie, I really don't know. I just love that I can read a book and watch a movie and there not be that many things different. 

Ok, there will be . . . . 



This is a remarkable story of people from different sides of the tracks. The greasers (the poor boys and some girls) and the socs (the rich kids)



This story is told from the greasers side which is awesome because I really don't care about the socs! 

These boys all looked out for each other in the best ways they could. Even if they were dirt poor, they did what they could for each other. 



They had fun times getting in rumbles with the socs, most all of them loved to fight. It was like getting set loose in a candy store. 

Most of the beginning of the story revolves around Ponyboy and Johnny. They are the best of friends and poor Johnny seems to have it bad no matter which way he turns. His parents treat him bad, he sleeps outside most of the time and he got a very bad beating from the socs. That's what they do, cruise around and find a greaser or two alone and gang up on them. They damn near beat Johnny to death and all of the other friends always rally around him and try to protect him from things. 

Until one tragic night Ponyboy and Johnny get attacked by a group of socs AGAIN, but this time Johnny stabs and kills the jerk that beat him so bad before. They were trying to drown Ponyboy. They have to run to Dallas to help get them out of town. Because that's what friends do, they hang out and help each other if they are in trouble. 



Dallas tells Ponyboy and Johnny to hop on this train and go to a town and stay in an abandoned church until things die down and he would come up there. He gives them money and a gun. Johnny buys them food and hair dye for Ponyboy (which he hates) and he also gets ""Gone With The Wind"" for Ponyboy because he has always wanted to read it. I thought that was so nice of him and he picked a really great book. Ponyboy spent time reading the book to his friend when they weren't playing cards to pass the time. 

At one point Dallas shows up and tells them some things and takes them out to eat. The boys decide they are going to turn themselves in but when they get back to the church, it's on fire and there are a couple of people and a bunch of children huddled around it. When the boys get there they find out some of the kids are inside and Ponyboy and Johnny (being the good guys that they are) go in after them. Of course Dallas is yelling for them to get back out! 

Needless to say they get the kids to safety but Dallas and Ponyboy get a little hurt in the process. Johnny gets messed up bad. It's always Johnny! He always just wanted to be normal for shite's sake! The people thought they were heroes which is truly what they were. 

""We think the towheaded kid is going to be all right. He burned one arm pretty badly, though, trying to drag the other kid out the window. Johnny, well I don't know about him. A piece of timber caught him across the back--he might have a broken back, and he was burned pretty severely. He passed out before he got out the window. They're giving him plasma now."" He must have seen the look on my face because he hurriedly changed the subject. ""I swear, you three are the bravest kids I've seen in a long time. First you and the black-haired kid climbing in that window, and then the tough-looking kid going back to save him. Mrs. O'Briant and I think you were sent straight from heaven. Or are you just professional heroes or something?""
Sent from heaven? Had he gotten a good look at Dallas? ""No, we're greasers,"" I said. I was too worried and scared to appreciate the fact that he was trying to be funny.

Johnny isn't doing so well in the hospital and Dallas and Ponyboy are really afraid for him. 

Dallas breaks out of the hospital on the night of the rumble to fight for Johnny. He was so happy after the fight that he grabbed Ponyboy and rushed back to the hospital to tell Johnny they had won. Even though, they didn't know it at the time, they got to spend the last few minutes with Johnny before he died. It was so sad, I cried a river. I knew what was going to happen but it doesn't matter, I cried the river. 



Dallas goes nuts of course and runs off. Ponyboy is in a daze when he gets home and tells everyone that Johnny is dead and that Dallas ran off. They are all sad of course and worried what Dallas is going to do. And then they get the call that Dallas robbed a store and the police are after him so they go to meet up with him. But when they get to him the stupid cops killed him. And I think he wanted that really because he pulled an unloaded gun on them. Maybe it's just my thoughts but I feel like he called the guys because he did want to live in a way but he was so messed up with Johnny dying after all that poor kid had been through, that he wanted to die himself. Of course I cried and cried at that as well. 



So, Ponyboy is trying to cope with two of his friends dying in one night. He doesn't do very well and is sick for quite some time. 

This book really made me have some feels. Like I said before I have watched the movie a million times but as an adult, reading the book put more things into perspective. This is the second book that I have read lately that has made me want to change some things in my life. At least some of the things that I can and that is one of the many things I love about reading. ‚ô•

745,V. A Court of Wings and Ruin is NEW ADULT/EROTICA but Goodreads editors won't tell you to include it in the choice awards,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Nov 17, 2016",1,"WARNINGS WARNINGS 
I don't recommend this book if you feel uncomfortable with books that depict graphically

* Pedophilia/rape (view spoiler)[ A 9 year old girl forced to marry and later bear a child to a grown man  (hide spoiler)]

* Incest/child abuse (view spoiler)[ The Buendia family members are constantly falling in love with close cousins, half brothers, nephews. An older woman Amarantha makes out with her underage nephew  (hide spoiler)]
* Non sensical Violence (view spoiler)[ including the cruel death of a newborn, and that's the ending scene. This book leaves you feeling disturbed  (hide spoiler)]
*Prostitution
* Cheating
* Bestiality
* Women treated as objects sometimes by their own parents





If you like me grew up reading marvelous books like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Twilight, The Hunger games, which are all extremely strong in terms of characterization and character development and which are at times trashed by the same critics that praised this piece of cr%p, I doubt you'll enjoy this book because:

* No plot, everything is a messy mix of twisted, and I mean TWISTED, disturbing, cringe-inducing family anecdotes
*No character development. 
* Poor character presentation. Other than I know that Amarantha is somehow fierce it's difficult to describe the rest of the characters personalities. What are their goals? What do they want? What do they fear? Who are they? What are their motivations?
* Poor worldbuilding. Am I supposed to know how Macondo, the setting of this book looks like? All I know is that Macondo founders were trying to reach the sea and they couldn't and were tired of travelling so I know there's no sea close to this town. The rules of this world don't seem to follow a logic, either. It's like Garcia Marques just smoke weed and added whatever he saw when he was under the effects of the weed to add magical elements here and there. I rarely notice worldbuilding issues in my reads because I have a strong imagination. Even books that don't describe the rules of their worlds or the setting properly don't turn me off, but since this book is universally praised as a ""master piece"" I was expecting more. 
* No coherent timeline, Little to No dialogue
* Author breaking the rule of show don't tell 98% of the book




I should have tried to convince my professor to change this assigment. I should've told him that this kind of topics are potential PTSD triggers for me (which is 100% true, although usually books don't activate triggers for me, certain kind of music and smells are triggering for me) or that they are against my religious beliefs (that'd been a lie, but I wish I had lied) Maybe it wouldn't have worked and still I'd been stuck to read this horrible book, but these professors should be more responsible when assigining this kind of disturbing readings and forcing people to read them taking away our sacred right of DNF a book we don't enjoy .

I'm aware that the author won a Nobel Prize, but it seems to me that it was more like the academy thought it'd be rebellious and edgy to give an award to this author leaving other more talented authors out, therefore steering controversy. Sort of like they did when they gaveBob Dylan the Nobel Prize even if he's a songwriter and poet more than a book writer.

I don't even know who is supposed to enjoy this book. I think that some Hispanic readers might find something good in this book because it seems to me that the author at times was talking about Colombian/Hispanic political issues in a metaphoric way, but honestly there wasn't enough of that.

Also, the opening line of this book is supposedly matter of study in English literature courses around the world 


'Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.'


 I can see why some readers might find that intriguing and get hooked from there, but I read a lot of books with great opening lines/paragraphs in commercial literature. Angefall by Susan EE, Divergent by Veronica Roth, Maze Runner by James Dashner have strong opening lines that get you hooked. I think every reader gets hooked by different opening lines, so why critics and scholars think this opening line is better than any is beyond me. However, I'll say that the ending scene was strong and extremely disturbing. It's a scene that will make you feel haunted and in search of a happy reading because (view spoiler)[ A newborn is eaten by ants. You're supposed to imagine the ants carrying only the carcass of what was moments before a lovely baby ... who was born with a pigtail O_O (hide spoiler)]

I'm only writing this because I need to organize my ideas for my essay. I doubt that writing my honest opinion about this trash will earn me a good mark, so I'm trying to find an angle to write about. Maybe I can write about the role of women in Garcia's books. The other Garcia's book I read was Chronicle of a foretold death which was thankfully short and somehow realistic, but still 100% misogynist. An oudated view of women is common in this author's writings.
My recommendations if you are forced to read this author:

* Write notes for each time a new Buendia appears. There are at least a dozen characters sharing almost the exact name and that is confusing
* Don't expect character development, don't expect world building
* Don't expect brilliant dialogue, although you can expect beautiful monologues
* Expect a lot of info-dumping and exposition
* Expect a lot of magical elements, but not the kind of magic that makes you want to live in this world.
* Expect a lot of misogynism It's like the author comes from ancient times or the Taliban and his views on women are very outdated. As a demi-feminist some scenes were hard to stomach.
* Keep an enjoyable read at hand because sometimes you're tired of this world and you want to get out of it by reading something good.

Long story short, this book is way Overrated. Overrated doesn't cover it. I think the author, may he rest in peace, might have written it under the effects of the weed.

747,Djali ‚ùÄ,Il giardino segreto,"Dec 12, 2020",5,"Impresa ardua trovare parole per descrivere una tra le letture pi√π significative della propria infanzia. Trovare parole per il libro che abbiamo pi√π amato quando da bambini leggevamo sulla terrazza o il lettone di casa dei nonni, d‚Äôestate, con l‚Äôatmosfera magica del tramonto. Quando non ci chiedevamo come fosse possibile essere trascinati in un altro mondo grazie alle parole di un libro, come fosse possibile preoccuparsi, arrabbiarsi, piangere per delle persone che esistevano solo nella nostra testa.

Prendo in prestito le parole di chi, meglio di me, ha saputo rendere il senso di nostalgia che ci invade quando guardiamo, tocchiamo, sfogliamo o addirittura solo pensiamo a un libro che ci √® appartenuto (nel senso di letto, divorato, adorato, amato) nell‚Äôinfanzia:
‚ÄúNon vi sono forse giorni della nostra infanzia che abbiamo vissuto cos√¨ pienamente, come quelli che abbiamo creduto di aver trascorso senza viverli, i giorni passati in compagnia di un libro prediletto. Il gioco per il quale un amico veniva a cercarci durante il brano pi√π interessante, l‚Äôape o il raggio di sole fastidiosi, che ci costringevano ad alzare gli occhi dalla pagina o a cambiare di posto, le provviste che ci avevano dato per la merenda e che lasciavamo accanto a noi su una panca, senza toccarle, mentre sul nostro capo la forza del sole andava diminuendo nel cielo azzurro.
Il pranzo che ci aveva costretti a tornare a casa e durante il quale pensavamo solo a quando, subito dopo, saremmo saliti a terminare il capitolo interrotto, vale a dire tutto ci√≤ che, a quanto sembrava, riempiva quei giorni per gli altri, e che noi respingevamo quale ostacolo volgare a un piacere divino, e di cui la lettura avrebbe dovuto farci percepire soltanto l‚Äôinopportunit√†.
Tutto ci√≤ ce ne imprimeva invece un ricordo cos√¨ dolce (tanto pi√π prezioso, a nostro giudizio attuale, di quello che allora leggevamo con amore) che, se ci capita ancor oggi di sfogliare i libri di una volta, altro non vediamo in essi se non gli unici calendari che abbiamo conservato dei giorni fuggiti, e con la speranza di veder riflesse sulle loro pagine le dimore e gli stagni che pi√π non esistono.‚Äù Marcel Proust"
748,Lit Bug,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Oct 31, 2012",5,"In the course of 5 years, I‚Äôve read this book nearly 17 times. That adds up to reading it once at least every 4 months, on an average. And I still return to this book like a bark seeking a lighthouse in the dark. When I first finished it, I was so overwhelmed by how much I related to it, I read it nearly 8 times before the year ended. By now I‚Äôve memorized almost every scene and I still can‚Äôt shake off the feeling that I still have to learn a lot from it. Over the years, I realize that without knowing it, it has become my personal Bible ‚Äì a beacon to keep me from straying from the path of kindness and compassion, no matter what.

With its baseless cruelty and what Coleridge poetically referred to as motiveless malignity, the world is in need of much motiveless kindness ‚Äì a rugged determination to keep the world a quiet haven and not the callous, cruel place it constantly aspires to be.

To Kill A Mockingbird is one of those rare books that doesn‚Äôt give in to the belief that ‚Äùdeep down, everybody‚Äôs actually good.‚Äù Not everybody is. And we must still persevere to see things from their perspective, and though we may not justify their ways, we must strive to understand them ‚Äì though we might not follow them, we must try to be as kind to them as possible. And yet, there comes a time when some people need to be put down ‚Äì we must follow the call of our conscience then, and yet be kind to them in the process, as much as we can.

Striving to follow this dictum, I have realized how difficult it is to be kind to others when I find I‚Äôm right. It is so easy to put down others bluntly, it is so easy to be critical and fair, but so difficult to consider for a moment what the other might be going through. How convenient it is to dismiss the hardships of others and say, ‚ÄúThey had it coming!‚Äù and unburden our conscience of the probable guilt that perhaps we‚Äôve been a bit too harsh.

How simple it is to stereotype people, classify them neatly into convenient square boxes and systematically deal with them based on those black-or-white prejudices! Robe a prejudice in the opaque, oppressive garment called Common Sense and display boldly the seal of Social Approval and you‚Äôve solved the biggest difficulty of life ‚Äì knowing how to treat people.

And yet, nothing could be farther than the truth. Rarely are people so simple as they seem. In Wilde‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúThe pure and simple truth is rarely pure and never simple.‚Äù For you never know when a grumpy, rude, racist Mrs. Dubose might be fighting her own monsters or Ewell be, in fact trying to protect the last vestiges of honor he has, or Aunt Alexandra only trying to advocate the least painful way of life. And though we might not agree with any of them, like Atticus, we must see them for their peculiar situations and grant them a little leeway, make a little corner for them too, and yet, stand up for what is right in defiance of them.

It is this tricky rope-walking balance between prejudice and common sense, kindness and firmness, and justice and leeway that spurs me to revisit this little book every time I seem to falter. While I find it difficult to keep my cool in the midst of flagrant injustices and ensuing pain, I strive to strike a balance between giving in to despair and becoming too optimistic; between becoming indifferent, unkind, righteous and being compassionate, considerate. It is what keeps me from becoming paranoid or cynical with the unceasing drone of passivity, callousness, overwhelming prejudice and unyielding customs while still being alive to the pain of those very people I do not necessarily agree with.

In a country like India with its bizarre, incomprehensible equations and sequestrations of religion, class, caste, region, language, race, gender, sexuality and education, it takes a whole load of effort not to blow up one‚Äôs mind ‚Äì people will kill each other over anything and everything. They‚Äôll hate each other, isolate each other and cook up stories amongst themselves and leave it floating in the air. It takes every ounce of my energy not to hate my land and its majority people viciously. Yes, viciously.

But you see, I‚Äôve got so much to learn to survive here ‚Äì I have to stand up for myself when there will be hordes banging upon my door telling me to shut the hell up. And I‚Äôll have to muster all the courage I have to tell them to go f*** themselves if they think I musn‚Äôt transcend the limits set for me. But I also have to learn not to hate them. Even if it sounds silly.

I know for one, Lee ‚Äì I don‚Äôt care if you never wrote another work. I don‚Äôt care if Capote helped you write it, as many say. I‚Äôm glad somebody wrote this book, and somebody assigned this book as syllabus when I needed it the most. Five years ago, I hadn‚Äôt even heard of it. I read it in a single sitting. And then I read it several times over, taking my time, pondering over every page. I still do so. It is my favorite book ever."

753,Nilufer Ozmekik,Wuthering Heights,"Feb 06, 2021",5,"Here‚Äôs my choice for flashback Saturday at the time of another Mercury retrograde! One of my all time favorite classics: Wuthering Heights.

The readers of this unconventional, provocative masterpiece truly diverted in two sides: haters and true admirers. 

 I‚Äôm one of the admirers because I always like to read about honest approach to the monsters wearing human furs in the real world. Catherine and Heathcliff are irritating, extremely selfish, destructive, illogical characters. They can be definite as threatening monsters. The claustrophobic, dark, agitating world building at Yorkshire moors: desolated, remote, freezing grassland reflects true beauty and ugliness at the same time ( like the reflection of its own habitants) combines with the dark souls of the characters and push you into depressive,intense, bleak world of them filled with grudge, hatred, resentment. 

 Why a man turn into a monster? Abuse he endured throughout the years from his family can manipulate his mind and make him think he‚Äôs not worthy enough. His bottled up anger, growing inferiority complex, sadness pushed him so far to kill the last pieces of humanity left in his body. He turns into a violent man beating his wife, cursing to his faith, becoming more vindictive at each second, fueling himself with the pain of the others just like he suffered when he witnessed his soulmate chose to marry with someone else and deep inside he is still humiliated Gypsy orphan boy even though now he is rich and powerful man . But in the meantime the man is still capable to feel passionate love. Did his obsessive love feed his hatred and push him too far to plan his vindictive revenge? 

 He‚Äôs not the only villain of the story, his true love Catherine is also selfish, vicious, filed with hatred. The anger inside of them darkens their souls. They slowly decay and turn into ruthless creatures who don‚Äôt carry any piece of empathy. 
 Catherine and Heathcliff‚Äôs story was too intimidating, destructive, unconventional for 19th century of England but as far as I can see it‚Äôs still way too much complex, heartfelt, painful for the world we‚Äôre living in, too.

Multi POVed storytelling technique and the heartbreaking, moving, extremely disturbing, dark, traumatic and truly tragic story of two most argumentative characters of the literature still haunt my soul but like a moth to a flame I cannot help myself to be drawn to this book over and over again. 

Here are my favorite quotes: 
‚ÄúDo I want to live? . . . [W]ould you like to live with your soul in the grave?‚Äù

‚ÄúBe with me always‚Äîtake any form‚Äîdrive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of being enclosed here. I‚Äôm wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou loved me‚Äîthen what right had you to leave me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have to remind myself to breathe‚Äîalmost to remind my heart to beat!‚Äù"
754,James,Twilight ,"Jul 06, 2008",3,"It turns out we don't need Dr. John Gray to tell us that men are from Transylvania and women are from Venus. We just need to read Stephenie Meyer books. For example, from this book we learn that the millions of women who have wolfed down the Twilight series (pun intended) want men who:

1. Talk about their feelings. Either Meyer's husband is the single-most communicative male on the planet and she doesn't realize how unusual he is, or she, like most of her female readers, is using her fiction to imagine a world where men not only have deep emotions but want to admit to having them and talk about them over and over, articulating even the most subtle of their internal dramas. 

2. Make them flutter. But just being a sensitive new-age kind of guy doesn't cut it. A man has to be hard-bodied, chiseled, dashing, and have eyes that pierce the soul, if not the skin (even as they never look at your chest). This book suggests that a real man makes you constantly stumble over your words, bite your lip to refrain from exclaiming adulations, and lose yourself in the sweet smell of his breath. 

3. Are fiercely devoted. That a girl of no spectacular beauty, who lacks any trace of conversation skills -- whose only virtue is that she smells really yummy -- can inspire an immortal creature of godlike power and grace to alter his entire existence to serve and protect her, watching over her by night (more on that in #4). This is a woman's ultimate fantasy -- to have the perfect man, perfectly devoted, for no good reason at all.

4. Want them so bad that they won't take them. This, alas, is the most transparent aspect of this book's appeal. It speaks volumes about the differences between men and women to have so many women toss their bodice-ripping romances aside in order to read how a feral man with otherworldly physical desires can contain his passion and lust out of his pure and perfect love for his beloved. It says that women really do wish they could have it both ways, to be an object of lust and devotion at once, to fulfill a man's desire without actually slaking his thirst for her. To have a man watch you sleep and not want to have even a little peek under the covers -- now that's hot fantasy for today's woman who is otherwise told on a regular basis that to be her best self she has to enage in casual and risky sexual behavior. 

To see just what an indulgent fantasy this book is, just imagine the male-centric version of Twilight, in which a troubled teen boy moves to a small town to find the hottest girl in town is a vampiress. Such a book would be about 100 pages long (all the unnecessary internal dialogue would be removed). No one would talk except to comment on the awesome size of, um, one's videogame library. The vampiress would be simple: relatively dumb, incredibly hot, wearing almost nothing, and with no expectations of her man but drawn to him only by the smell of his gym bag. She wouldn't hold herself back from trying to bite her intended, but would get so distracted with his bedroom technique that she would never get around to it. 

We would laugh at such a book (in fact, we know it would never be a book since men don't read; it would be a movie, and it would be a smash summer hit called American Vam-Pie-er, I'll start the screenplay right away). Somehow, when this story is told in a similarly indulgent female-centric vein, we don't reject it, but sympathize with it. I believe this is because women get to indulge in their fantasies so rarely outside of Jane Austen novels while men are surrounded with theirs. So far I have yet see spam email inviting one to ""read hot things devoted husbands would say to their wives"" or ""see pictures of hunks promising not to get nasty out of respect for their women"" or ""buy this purple pill so you can stay up late and share your feelings -- seven times in one night!."" So hats off to Stephenie Meyer for figuring out what it is that women really want and giving it to them."
755,Alienor ‚úò French Frowner ‚úò,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Aug 14, 2016",1,"The book be like - CRY, BITCH.


After 50 pages I would have written that The Perks of Being a Wallflower was poorly written, boring and tasteless.

After 100 pages I would have clapped because really, wow, Stephen Chbosky really did want to tick all the strong issues boxes, haha. /sarcasm. 

After 150 pages I would have needed a drink to handle all that fucking CRYING and talking and the total LACK of any attempt to actually DEAL with the issues piling up. No, three pages of so-called teenage philosophy isn't enough. 

In the end I'm just pissed off by the plain MANIPULATION that is this book and by the way the last issue is taken care of - FUCK YOU, BOOK. No, really. Fuck you. I am very sorry for all the people on Earth who loved this book, and know that this review isn't about you. I started The Perks of Being a Wallflower expecting to love it. 

As it is, I cannot. 

Probably because it contains what I hate the most in Literature, this being : 

- The blatant use of manufactured drama trying to force me to feel things. It doesn't work like that. You do NOT involve a reader by creating an unrealistic overkill of serious issues, as if they were trying to outbid each other. There's a moment when I just don't care anymore. This is manipulative and disrespectful. 

It reads like a catalogue of the worst situations possible. 

- The fact that the sub-mentioned issues aren't given the time of a day and are just there. Nope. And because I know that people will tell me that it's realistic because Charlie is only 15, and that he can't analyze these issues in depth : yes, he cannot. THAT IS THE POINT. Why include so many issues - teen pregnancy, drinking, drugs, sexual identity, abuse, and so on - if they're only there to fill the book? WHY? I am the first to admit that we mustn't take teenagers for fools and that YA novels should picture these issues. But COME. ON. What is even the point if they're only brushed off? Is telling them that it happens to other people is going to make them feel better? Is telling them that we can ignore problems because everything is going to get better anyway (because fairies, I guess) A GOOD THING? I don't think so. And yes, when something like abuse is dealt in TWO pages, I do get the feeling that the book is telling me to move the fuck on. 

Also, that ""beautiful"" sentence, ""we accept the love we think we deserve""? When applied to the situation? (view spoiler)[Charlie's sister being hit by her boyfriend (hide spoiler)] Please don't.*

* I am not thick, of course I understand what this sentence is trying to say... But again, empty words. I would have probably loved it as a 14 years old. Now I'm just like, AND THEN WHAT?

- Repetitive and choppy sentences all the way through, with a main character who can't decide if he's 10 or 40 or, I don't know, 5. I HATED the writing, I really did. 

- Characters who don't feel like teenagers at all - mainly Sam and Patrick, the super hipsters philosophers *snorts*

The book be like - NOW SMILE, BITCH.

Wow! That was amazing! 

Yes, yes. I‚Äôve already seen the movie, but the book is so much better.

In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is scraping by, just trying to make her daily living, hunting by her bow in the forest to feed her family. Every year, The Capitol requires every district to offer up one boy and one girl as tributes. The tributes fight each other to the death until only one person survives. This fight is called The Hunger Games.

The day of the Reaping finally comes. This is the day where the one boy and one girl are selected. Unfortunately, Prim, Katniss‚Äôs younger sister is selected. In an incredible act of bravery, Katniss volunteers to take her sister‚Äôs place. Will Katniss make it through The Hunger Games?

First of all, the narrator on this was perfect. She even did the accent for the Capitol people, and she sang the song. 

Second, The Hunger Games is a perfect dystopian novel. It has different dresses and customs, but it isn‚Äôt overkill or confusing. 

There are also many parallels to today‚Äôs society. For example, why do the citizens allow The Hunger Games? Because they don‚Äôt believe that their children will be selected. How many people believe that they will never be unemployed, never get divorced, never become seriously ill or injured? People like betting on themselves. But we, as a society, aren‚Äôt we better off if we made sure that there were strong safety nets in place for those who happen on hard times? 

In The Hunger Games, all is also not equal. The tributes can have sponsors who rain down much needed supplies on the tributes. We like to think that everyone has an equal opportunity. But is that really the case when the rich can purchase private ACT/SAT tutors for their children? What about those who start their first job and have strong allies and mentors from day one? 

But I also loved this book, because it had many small acts of kindness.

‚ÄúKind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there.‚Äù ‚Äì The Hunger Games

With cruelty becoming commonplace, kindness stands out. When District 11 came together, I racked my brain trying to remember the last time that we, as a society, came together for a cause, and I came up short. I think the world is hungry for a rallying cry, a cause that we can all fight together for. What would the world be like if the cruelty was replaced by kindness? Full disclosure: may have cried just a little bit reading this.

Looking forward to the next book in the series‚Ä¶.

I think I‚Äôm falling in love all over again. This will always be my favorite book and I am see myself reading this another 4 times during this year.
I believe this is a book that all ages need to read, it‚Äôs such a life changer and it shows you have rough people have it. Rich or poor everybody goes through some sort of hell. It teaches you to respect and appreciate where you are brought up and who you are brought up with. Always choose kindness.

This book is some what violent, funny yet witty, sad but joyful and most of us important!

The Giving Tree ~~ Shel Silverstein
 


 I recently reread Shel Silverstein's The Giving Tree. It was the first time in many years I have read it. 
I love this book
; I always have. But, reading it as an adult, over 30, was so different this time around. The warm fuzzies of past reads were missing. Now, it made me feel sad, and empty. This go around, I saw it not as a parable of generosity and love, but instead I saw it as a story of selfishness, greed and destruction. Perhaps I was influenced this time by events of my past, or by the events of mr trump's follies. Or, maybe, I've become jaded by age ...



The funny thing is, I still love 
The Giving Tree
. It was powerful the first time around, and even more so this time. What can you say about a book that had a profound impact on you in your youth and again, years later but in a totally different way. The tree is selfless (me as an adult) and the boy becomes selfish (me in my youth) ~~ and let's not talk about the thing's I've (the boy) done for love. 



Yup, I can relate."
759,Mark Lawrence,A Game of Thrones ,"Nov 07, 2010",5,"I rated this in 2010. In 2017 it's time I actually use my words.

Here's my long overdue review of A Game of Thrones. I was looking at the current reviews. Here you have a book with a ridiculously high average rating, vast sales, and ‚Ä¶ the most liked reviews are three 1*s and an unrated comedy piece. 

Do we love to hate *that* much? Apparently we do. Not only is knocking down easier than building, it‚Äôs also more fun to watch. 

 

Well, sadly all I have to offer here is a less exciting set of praise for the genius and importance of this book.

The first bit of genius is that on paper GRRM writes in not only the opposite manner to me but in a manner I profess to dislike. Wait ‚Ä¶ I like how he writes on paper ‚Ä¶ you know what I mean.

Things he does that should annoy me:

I)	Lengthy descriptions of ‚Ä¶ everything, especially food, clothing, and architecture. Normally I hate wading through that stuff to get at the story. Somehow GRRM does it in a way I like.
II)	Large numbers of point of view characters. I normally find this makes each of them rather shallow and stereotyped. GRRM is magnificent with characters and brings even the throw away non-point of view ones to life.
III)	Huge, expanding story lines. I tend to like some sort of focus but every corner you turn in this series can end up leading you down a seemingly endless rabbit hole of minor noble houses, their retainers, local squabbles, history etc. And this has irked me at points, especially in the later books, but it‚Äôs also kind of marvellous and makes everything feel really real, and also deep-rooted in a Tolkienesque way.

 
I maintain that not only is Game of Thrones a brilliant read, it‚Äôs also an important one for the genre. It‚Äôs meaningful to talk about post-GRRM fantasy. 

For many people, indeed for a decent chunk of a whole generation of fantasy authors, George RR Martin's A Game of Thrones was a step change in the genre.



For me and a lot of other authors Martin's work opened our eyes to what felt like a whole different world of what fantasy writing could be, and we've run out into those new territories eager to try to copy not the style or substance, but the quality.

In my youth when we entered a fantasy land we were expected to suspending our belief about magic and alternate worlds, but not only that. We were expected to enter a sort of mythic / fairy tale world where people weren't quite... real. They didn't feel like actual regular humans, bound by the same fears, worries, ambitions, aches and pains as you and I - they felt more like actors in roles, cogs in a plot engine, icons and ciphers. They were too good, or too evil.

Fantasy had its conventions and we played within them, reader and author exercised a mutual understanding regarding the rules - rather like ancient Greek theatre, or a musical where for no reason the cast can break from the story into a rousing song.


 

Of course I exaggerate. And this isn't to say that authors didn't weave fascinating and compelling stories within those conventions. The fantasy of the 70s and 80s kept me very happy and some of it was written by writers of surpassing genius. Even so... it was quite definitely 'apart' from the books that really touched me or showed me new things about 'what it's all about' - works of literary fiction, and miles distant from what 99% of the public was reading.

The step I'm talking about may be entirely artificial or demonstrable fact. It may be that in the 90's when I was reading very little fantasy the genre moved smoothly into what it is now. It may be that GRRM is talked of as a step change by so many simply because his success meant that A Game of Thrones was the first book that fantasy exiles actually picked up after their absence, and thus they saw in it a 'sudden' significant difference ... or it may be that he really did raise the bar in one swift move.

Either way, what he did was to present us with real people. I'm not talking about the 'gritty realism' that is of late so hotly debated in some quarters of the interwebs - I'm just talking about the strength of his characterisation, the creation of real people with everyday weaknesses, wants, ambitions, set in a world that feels like it has a genuine past that matters to them, both on the grand and small scales.

What he did drew many people back into the genre, as readers and as writers. His work was both a challenge and an invitation. He showed what fantasy could be. Real people who didn't carry a particular flaw around like an attribute rolled up in a role-playing game, but who were complex, capable of both good and evil, victims of circumstance, heroes of the moment. Heroes in gleaming mail could suffer from corns without it being a joke. That's a big part of his secret - EVERYONE IS HUMAN - get behind their eyes and nobody is perfect, nobody is worthless.

I don't write anything like George RR Martin. I don't lay claim to any significant portion of his talent. But I do count myself as one of his many inheritors (in this game you can inherit without requiring the other person to stop writing!). And what I inherited was the desire (if not the ability) to put it all on the page. Fantasy no longer feels like an acquired taste, a club where you have to learn the conventions, the forms, what the masks mean, what the short hand is for... fantasy feels real. And I love it.

760,Debbie W.,The Secret Garden,"Mar 04, 2022",4,"Why I chose to read this book:
1. I remember seeing this lovely story reenacted as a musical play by some middle-school students several years ago and was impressed by their performance; and,
2. I wanted to end my ""Classics Month"" with this book that my GR friend, Isabel, recommended!

Positives:
1. I appreciated the believable growth of various characters, going from sour dispositions and downright rudeness to being filled with hope, joy and empathy. After just reading a book about another orphan (Heidi), I was introduced to the polar opposite of that loveable character to this book's main character, Mary Lennox. With parents like hers, it's no wonder that Mary (and later, we learn, also Colin), have such disagreeable personalities! Luckily for these two children, fortunate circumstances, such as understanding adults, good friends, especially Dickon, (view spoiler)[at first, I thought that he was an angel or ghost! (hide spoiler)] and exposure to nature, changed and enhanced Mary and Colin's lives;
2. speaking of which, I couldn't get over the similarities between the ""sickly"" children, Colin (The Secret Garden) and Clara (Heidi). Both have a deceased mother and an absentee father who travels extensively, leaving his/their child(ren) behind for long periods of time, both cannot walk, and both have friends (Mary and Heidi, respectively) who help them recover by believing in themselves;
3. since I had also recently read The Wind in the Willows, I was amused/pleased at how the animals featured in that story also make appearances in The Secret Garden!; and,
4. as a flower gardener myself, I could highly relate to Mary and her friends' happiness while gardening, from weeding and pruning to experiencing the ecstasy of all the sensory delights emanating from such a sanctuary. üåπüå∑üå≥

A couple of niggles:
1. Colin's ramblings about his intentions for self-improvement went on a little long for me ü•±; and,
2. I cringed (on page 252 of my edition) when Colin expressed support for domestic abuse! üò±

As a parent, grandparent and teacher, I loved the overall message that good food, exercise, fresh air, unstructured play, socialization and engagement with nature are what young children need to grow and thrive. A wonderful story about trust and friendship!"
761,Emma,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Oct 06, 2007",2,"If I had to define ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" by Audrey Niffenegger in two words they would be: poignant and excessive‚Äîtwo words that also illustrate my mixed feelings about Niffenegger‚Äôs first novel.

‚ÄúThe Time Traveler‚Äôs Wife‚Äù is about many things. Obviously time travel is an important feature, but this novel is also about librarians, artists, punk rock, and alcoholics. It‚Äôs also about love.

Henry meets his wife, Clare, for the first time when he is 28 and Clare is 20. Clare met Henry for the first time when she was six and Henry was 36. Henry is, literally, a time traveler. Henry has a disease: a cellular disorder that leaves him unglued in time, traveling at random to various points in the past and future of his own life and, inexplicably, to Clare‚Äôs childhood. Henry cannot hold onto any of his possessions when he time travels‚Äîno clothes, no food, no money‚Äîa fact that often has a disastrous effect on Henry‚Äôs life.

Throughout it all, Clare is at Henry‚Äôs side faithfully waiting for him to return to her and their life together. 

Niffenegger alternates viewpoints, narrating the story in both Henry‚Äôs and Clare‚Äôs voice. Despite giving the characters equal narration time, Clare remains painfully one-dimensional. She is defined by her love for Henry, her artistic career and, unfortunately, little else.

Thankfully, Henry is written much more fully. Working as a librarian at the Newberry in his present, Henry also has a complex life ‚Äúout of time."" He is also well-versed in the culture of drugs and drinking. Really, Henry is a mess in every sense of the word. Despite all of his problems, though, Henry remains redeemable. Throughout the novel he clings to a certain charm, a quality that makes it plausible to believe that Clare really did love him long before Henry first met her.

The novel jumps from past to present and back again as Niffenegger aptly looks at how Henry‚Äôs past intersects with his present and his future, and his evolving relationship with Clare. These examinations are a particular strength of the novel. Niffenegger manages to discuss events multiple times without being redundant. At the same time she creates a complex storyline without making it impossible to follow.

Unfortunately, she does also falter. Most of the novel‚Äôs shortcomings stem from some kind of excess. First and foremost, it‚Äôs too long. (The hardcover edition runs 600 pages.) Particularly in the second half of the novel, it feels like Niffenegger takes on too much. There are too many characters to remember, too many events only tangentially relevant to the core plot. All things considered, the novel could easily have been at least a hundred pages shorter.

For this reason, the premise of the plot has some fundamental flaws‚Äîpoints that make no sense in relation to the rest of the narrative. On the whole, these blips are annoying but not damning (especially given the fact that the novel is marketed as general fiction as opposed to science fiction).

‚ÄúThe Time Traveler‚Äôs Wife‚Äù also veers dangerously close to melodrama, raining biblically disastrous situations on both Henry and Clare. Given the ending of the novel, one would think that merely being a time traveler would be enough bad luck to last both of their lifetimes. Aside from being plain old mean, this focus on events makes it difficult to develop the characters. Many interesting people walk in and out of Henry‚Äôs life, but few of them are adequately utilized in the book.

The scope of the narrative is vast and strongly cinematic, which leads me to two conclusions: One is that this story might have been better had someone else written it. The other is that the upcoming film adaptation will be better than the novel. Given the fascinating story and characters here, hopefully that will be the case.

762,Cecily,Jane Eyre,"May 30, 2008",5,"Child neglect, near death, a dash of magical realism, the power of love, the powerlessness of the poor, sexual rivalry, mystery, madness and more. It is as powerful as ever - but is it really a love story, given Rochester's Svengali-tendencies, or is it a life story? His downfall and her inheritance make them more equal, but is it really love on his part? I'm not sure, which is what makes it such a good book (just not necessarily a love story). I also like the tension between it being very Victorian in some obvious ways, and yet controversially modern in others: an immoral hero, a fiercely independent and assertive heroine, and some very unpleasant Christians (it's not that I think Christians are bad or like seeing them portrayed in a nasty way - it's Bronte's courage in writing such characters I admire). 

Childhood

About the first quarter of the book concerns the tremendous hardship and abuse that Jane suffers growing up. It's often heavily cut from film, TV and stage adaptations, but despite the fluff about this being a great love story, I think there is merit in paying attention to her formative years as an essential element of explaining what makes Jane the person she becomes.

The Red Room, where young Jane is banished shortly before being sent to Lowood, is a very short episode in the book, but its significance is probably greater than its brevity implies. The trauma of the Red Room is not just because Mr Reed died there, but because of the associations of red = blood = death, compounded by cold, silence, blinds that are always closed and a bed like a sacrificial altar. Is it also some sort of reference to Bertha's attic?

Jane endures dreadful hardships: she is orphaned; her aunt says she is ""less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep"" and invokes the wrath of God who ""might strike her dead in the midst of one of her tantrums""; she endures injustice as she strives to be good, but is always condemned, while the faults of her cousins are indulged or ignored. So, she is sent to Lowood, where she sees the hypocritical tyranny of Brocklehurst, survives cold and near starvation and witnesses her best friend's death. Nevertheless, ""I would not have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries."" There is a dreadful irony in the fact that the first time a relative demonstrates any interest in her (John Eyre), it seems to ruin everything. 

Villains and Christianity

Who is the worst villain: John Reed, Aunt Reed, Mr Brocklehurst, Blanche Ingram, St John Rivers or even Rochester?

Christianity gets a very mixed press in the book: Mr Brocklehurst is cruel and comically hypocritical (curly hair is evil vanity in poor girls, who ""must not conform to nature"", but fine for his pampered daughters); St John Rivers thinks his devoutness selfless, but is actually cold and selfish (his motive being to gain glory in Heaven for himself); Helen Burns is a redemptive Christ figure who accepts her punishments as deserved, helps Jane tame herself (""Helen had calmed me"") and, of course, dies. 

Jane's own beliefs (or lack) are always somewhat vague (though she's very moral) and controversially feisty. When, as a small girl, the nasty Brocklehurst asks her what she should do to avoid going to Hell, she replies, ""I must keep in good health, and not die""!

Aspects the way Christianity is portrayed may make it more accessible to modern readers from more secular backgrounds, but might have been shocking to devout Victorians. Perhaps they were placated by the fact that despite the cruelty, Jane forgives Aunt Reed for trying to improve her errant niece, even though ""it was in her nature to wound me cruelly"".

Male Power, Feminism, and Relevance Today

Men had most of the power and respect in Bronte's time and often Jane has to go along with that. However, Bronte does subvert that to some extent by making Jane so assertive, determined and independent. 

The story of Jane Eyre has parallels with the story of Bluebeard, albeit with a very different ending, in which the woman takes charge of her own destiny. Bluebeard was well-known in Victorian fables as a rich and swarthy man who locked discarded wives in an attic (though he killed them first). He took a new young wife and when she discovered her predecessors, he was about to kill her, but she was rescued by her brothers, rather as Mason wants to rescue Bertha. Jane even likens an attic corridor to one in ""some Bluebeard's castle"", so Bronte clearly knew the story and assumed he readers did too. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebear....

Despite her minimal contact with men, right from the outset Jane instinctively knows how to respond to the man she describes as ""changeful and abrupt"". When they first meet in the house and he is quizzing her, she consciously mirrors his tone (""I, speaking as seriously as he had done"") and ""His changes of mood did not offend me because I saw I had nothing to do with their alteration"". Like many bullies, he enjoys a bit of a fight, rather than the nervous, prompt and unquestioning obedience his manner normally elicits, and Jane isn't afraid to answer him back and speak her mind. It isn't long before she can say ""I knew the pleasure of vexing him and soothing him by turns"". When Blanche arrives, Jane realises ""he had not given her his love"" and that ""she could not charm him"" (as she could). At this point, she realises her self-delusions in overlooking his faults and merely considering them as ""keen condiments"".

What should modern women make of this book? Bronte is radical in that neither Jane nor Rochester is conventionally attractive (it is personality that matters) and Jane is fiercely independent and assertive, even when she gives the impression of being submissive. She even says, ""Women are supposed to feel very calm, generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint... precisely as men would suffer."" On the other hand, Rochester's treatment of Jane, Bertha, Blanche and C√©line is hard to justify (other than the fact he keeps Bertha alive - why not kill her?). Does disappointment and disability truly changed him, and does that, coupled with her independent wealth make them equals? Will they live happily ever after?

Rochester

What were Rochester's plans and motives for his relationship with Jane? Why does he insist that Jane appears in the drawing room every evening while Blanche and friends are staying, even though he fully understands and comments on how depressed it makes Jane? And would Rochester have married Blanche if Mason hadn't turned up, making a big society wedding impossible? If so, was Jane always in his mind as a mistress and backup in case marriage to Blanche was not possible, or did he only decide to marry her much later? What sort of basis for a happy marriage is that, and can the equalising effect of his later disability and her inheritance really conquer it? It's true that Rochester tells Jane ""I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you as madly in love with me as I was with you"", but that is after Mason's visit, so is it true?

Rochester's treatment of Bertha is even more problematic: divorce wasn't viable, and yet he didn't want to leave her behind in the Caribbean... very odd. In a funny sort of way, he might have felt he was doing the right thing by her, or at least, not the wrong thing. 

In a society which condemns divorce and cohabitation, is Rochester's planned bigamy justifiable? As Rochester hints to Jane early on, ""Unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules"". He also knows that Jane's integrity means she must be unaware of the details if he is to be with her (he says that if he asked her to do something bad, she would say ""no sir... I cannot do it, because it is wrong""), though in fact there is a bigger tussle between her head and heart than he might have expected. Later, he ponders the fact that she is alone in the world as being some sort of justification, ""It will atone"" and extends to the more blasphemous and deluded ""I know my Maker sanctions what I do. For the world's judgement - I wash my hands thereof."" 

St John

Jane's bond with St John is very different, and she realise it, ""I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature"". His proposal is positively alarming, ""You are formed for labour, not for love. A missionary's wife you must - shall be. You shall be mine: I claim you - not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's service""! Under the guise of serving God and man, he is irredeemably self-serving.

Magic Realism?

The strangest element is the small but hugely significant ethereal message from Rochester that might now be called magical realism. It sits oddly with the rest of the book, but I can never decide whether this is it a strength or a weakness.

Who Knows What?

A constant theme is ""who knows what?"". Is Aunt Reed ignorant of how awful Lowood is and has she truly convinced herself that her treatment of Jane is appropriate? How much does Mrs Fairfax know (and tell) about Rochester's wives, current and intended? Does Rochester know whether or not Adele is really his daughter, and what does Jane believe? Blanche appears to know very little, but is she only seeing what she wants to see? 

Love?

Overall, there is so much in this book, it is well worth rereading, but I am not convinced that it is a love story. It is the easiest label to apply, and although Jane certainly finds love, I am not sure that love finds her. They're intellectually well-matched, and the sparring and physical attraction bode well. On the other hand, my doubts about his motivations when he was juggling Blanche and Jane make me uneasy. 


Incidentally, I first read this book at school (a naive mid-teen enjoys and appreciates it for very different reasons than an adult). One day, we were at a point when Jane was with the Rivers and possibly being courted by St John. We were told to read to page x for homework, so I turned to that page to mark it and saw the famous words (not that I knew they were), ""Reader, I married him"" and was shocked to assume it referred to St John.

Jane's Place in My Life

There are many reasons I love this book, including - but not limited to:

1. The clich√© of first reading this at an impressionable age (15).
2. Coming with no preconceptions, other than knowing it was a classic - so I had a couple of big surprises in the plot.
3. Being at a boarding school myself at the time - though fortunately not (much) like Lowood.
4. Questioning my faith and the role of religion - then and since.
5. Questioning the roles and rights of women - then and since.
6. Jane, herself. That's a major one.
7. The fact the book is daringly subversive for its time (most of the Christians are bad, and Jane is fiercely outspoken and independent - most of the time). 
8. I get something new from it each time.

Like many, I first read this at school. I was captivated from the outset. Jane was wild, and brave, and rebellious - all things we weren't supposed to be, and yet we had to read and write about her. I vaguely knew about the wedding scene, but everything about her time with the Rivers was new and unexpected. For all that I had doubts about Rochester, I felt (in a naive, teenage way) I shared a passion for him. When I thought Jane would end up with St John, I was devastated. The actual ending was a happy relief - all the more so because it had been unexpected. 

I thought I understood the book, and got good marks for essays about it (apart from the injustice of being deducted marks for a comment a teacher refused to believe I hadn't copied from Brodie's Notes - a study guide I'd only ever heard of!). 

But like all great works of art, it speaks differently on each encounter, and the more I've read it, aided by a bit of maturity along the way, and now discussions with GR friends, the more I've seen in it.

So no, this not a love story - on the pages. But there is a love story: between the reader and Jane. 

Prequel

I finally read Jean Rhys' prequel ""Wide Sargasso Sea"", reviewed here: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...

2011 Film

I was disappointed with the Jane Eyre film. Mia Waskikowska was good as Jane, and it looked right, but Fassbender as Rochester was awful. He didn't brood enough for my liking, but what I think is less excusable is that he didn't really change during the course of the story. Just as bad, Jamie Bell was too nice to be St John. In fact the whole episode at the Rivers' was very poorly done. Overall, it removed all ambiguity, making a complex story of truth and lies, divided loyalty and mixed emotions boringly straightforward."
763,"Petra on hiatus, really unwell",To Kill a Mockingbird,"Jun 13, 2008",5,"Even in the evil times when John Crow ruled the South and the Blacks were scarcely more free than in times of slavery and were allowed no civic power nor respect from their erswhile masters who were White, good men did their best.

As regards this book, the last phrase is a lie.

Atticus, a lawyer and good and caring father, a moral man, represented a Black man accused of raping a White woman. He lost, but he'd done his best.

That last paragraph is a lie. 

Atticus belonged to the KKK, thought that Blacks were a distinctly lower form of human life and that separate development (ie. apartheid) was the best way to go for these childlike people who didn't have the reasoning power to rule, he said in Go Set a Watchman.

That last paragraph is mostly a lie. 

Atticus did belong to the KKK but he did not really think Blacks were a lower form of human life at all. That was just what he said for the benefit of others. He really thought their intellectual power and ability to organise was greatly to be feared. He was frightened that Whites would have to give up having a life of ease and wealth structured around the cheap labour Black people had no alternative but to provide. He didn't even want to have to consider them at all.

Atticus represented the accused Black rapist only because if a White lawyer didn't then he was sure the NAACP would send in a very clever Black lawyer and not only that but insist, since these times were officially 'free', that Black people sit on the jury. Then he would not be sure of a conviction. The Blacks then feeling their oats would move in to the town and start demanding rights and power much to the detriment of the extremely exploitative and racist Whites.

When Harper Lee wrote all this, in Go Set a Watchman her publishers were apparently horrified and got her to rewrite the book from the point of view of a decent man who felt racism was a great evil, we were all equal. Is this why Harper Lee never wrote another book? Did she feel that her views were unacceptable and she wasn't going to kow-tow to some liberal publishers up North who didn't understand the ways of the South? Is that why she didn't give interviews too? She'd followed the advice of her publishers, been lauded and rewarded but humiliated as an artist. 

Schools still teaching this book as a moral lesson should incorporate their understanding of the first draft, Go Set a Watchman. Otherwise they are doing the children a disservice in their moral education and furthering the ideas of paternalism is better than self-determination, racism had its softer side and that ignoring the truth (Watchman) to tell a good story is a perfectly fine concept for educationalists to embrace. It's not. 

Five stars because it is a very well-written and enjoyable book and hangs together with Go Set a Watchman perfectly.

I've also read countless reviews, both adoring and loathing and have come to the conclusion that this book does not garner any type of middle ground, you either love it or you hate it. 

I'm glad that I get to love it. What else can I say?
 


For me, this book shines, and to those of you who loved it, I imagine you are a bit like me. You found yourself immersed in a world where demons roam the night, weres run a bar, vamps occupy abandoned hotels, warlocks cast spells while rockin glitter in their hip hugging jeans, and the law is upheld by Shadowhunters, a race of humans blessed by the angel Raziel. Hokey? Sure. Rockin like a unicorn adorned bike? Hell yes! Even the setting, NYC, was so palpable; it became another character in this vibrant story. I thought the Shadowhunter world was funny, sleek, dark, sexy and hopeful. More importantly, the characters came so alive for me that they jumped off the pages. I felt as though I were in the story with them as opposed to merely following along in their journey.



Regardless of the types of books you prefer to read, or the characters that endear themselves to your heart, I think we all read to for some type of enjoyment. What evokes that enjoyment varies from reader to reader, but I still find excitement within these pages. To me, that is the mark of a fantastic book."

770,Dana Ilie,Les Mis√©rables,"Aug 09, 2013",5,"The experience of reading Les Miserables is akin to that of any lengthy novel. For hundreds of pages you‚Äôll be hooked, dazzled, unable to put it down. 

Alt autor vinovat pentru pasiunea mea de a citi. Nu citesc pentru ca e la moda, ca sa par boema sau ca sa devin mai populara, citesc din pasiune , pentru ca imi plac lumile si povestile create de oameni talentati . Nu ma ascund de realitate in spatele unei cari, doar traiesc povestea alaturi de autor si personaje.

Nu cred ca e cazul sa va spun ca e o poveste trista, Coperta pe care am ales-o ilustreaza cel mai bine ce am simtit cand am citit cartea. Banuiesc ca nimeni nu priveste poza de mai sus si se simte fericit, sau se tavaleste de ras‚Ä¶. Eu am citit varianta cu 5 volume, nu-mi aduc aminte editura. Dupa ce citesti cartea iti dai seama de ce Victor Hugo se afla printre monstrii sacrii ai literaturii. O poveste luuuunga , cu multe personaje, dar doar 5-6 centrale (toata lumea a auzit de : Jean Valjean, Cosette, Gavroche), dar nu simti ca citesti sute de pagini. Are fragmente in care te plictiseste cu detaliile istorice legate de generali, de bataliile date de Napoleon, care daca sari peste ele nu iti vaduveste cu nimic firul narativ al povesti. Spre rusinea mea eu saream peste ele, imi place istoria , dar fragmentele respective ma adormeau‚Ä¶..

Este o capodopera pe care o recomand tuturor deoarece simt ca eram mult mai saraca daca nu o citeam. Asa cum am autori preferati ( printre care si Hugo) am si un top 10 carti pe care le-as recomanda fara sa clipesc. Chiar nu pot sa povestesc nici un pic din carte , este mult prea complexa, mult prea bine scrisa, si de-a dreptul fascinanta.

In linii mari pot spune ca vom gasi saracie, nedreptate, fericirea luata din ajutorarea semenilor si din bucuria de a avea copii pentru care sa faci orice sacrificiu. Lupta cu saracia, lupta covarsitoare cu eticheta pusa de societate, fuga permanenta de oamenii legii, privirea peste umar la orice pas. Sa anticipezi miscarile facute de posibilii dusmani, si tot chinul acesta o viata de om. Simti o apasare , tristete, dar in acelas timp nu poti sa nu speri ca totul se va colora in culori mai vii. Cu fiecare situatie nefericita sau de-a dreptul revoltatoare te simti tot mai invaluit in poveste si te apropii de personaje , dorind sa le oferi confort si siguranta. Citind imi lasa impresia sincera ca daca citesc incontinuare ajut personajul aflat intr-o situatie periculoasa sa scape. Nu puteam sa las cartea din mana pana nu se afla intr-un loc sigur / situatie fara pericole.

Destinele personajelor se intersecteaza pe parcursul cartii, iar dupa mai multi ani cand se reintalnesc , nici nu au habar cum si-au influentat uniialtora viata.

Spre sfarsit apare si frumoasa poveste de dragoste mult asteptata. Doi adolescenti frumosi si o dragoste pura."
771,Hollie,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Jul 15, 2007",5,"This was the first book I picked up and read all the way through in one sitting. Technically, it's not a difficult read but conceptually it's rich and engaging.

""They have a word for people our age. They call us children and they treat us like mice.""

If you can't understand that statement, you probably won't like this book. It's about intelligent children. Not miniature adults- their motivations, understanding, and some-times naivete clearly mark them as children. But at the same time their intelligence and inner strength define them clearly as people. Their personalities are fully developed, even if their bodies are not.

The book is about war. About leadership. And about the qualities that make some one a powerful or admirable individual (not always the same thing). In this book children are both kind and cruel to each other as only children know how to be. It is not an easy book for anyone who understands childhood to be a happy time of innocence. Even still, the characters retain a certain amount of innocence.

The questions posed by the war, by the handling of the war, are relevant today, as they were when the book was written, and as they have been since the dawning of the atomic age. Foremost is the question of what makes someone or something a monster. It is an easy read, but not always a comfortable one.

I'd recommend this book for intelligent children. The sort that resent being talked down to and treated like kids. Here is a book that does not talk down to them, but understands and empathizes with them. Also I recommend it for adults who used to be that kind of child, even if science fiction is not your usual interest. More pure science fiction fans will find it interesting, as will those who enjoy exploring the philosophies of human nature and war. 

This book sets out to make you think."

773,Tom,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Jan 15, 2008",5,"Another classic. If you don't like this series, you probably put your babel fish in the wrong hole. You are the reason that human beings are only the third most intelligent species on earth behind mice and dolphins. So long, and thanks for all the fish!"
774,Vinaya,Jane Eyre,"Dec 21, 2010",5,"FIVE REASONS WHY JANE EYRE WOULD NEVER BE A BESTSELLER IN OUR TIMES:
5. Four hundred-odd pages of purely descriptive writing
4. Overt religious themes and moral preaching
3. A plain-Jane heroine who stays plain. No makeovers to reveal a hitherto hidden prettiness that only needed an application of hydrogen peroxide and some eyebrow plucking to emerge full-blown.
2. The world is not well-lost for love. In the war between self-respect and grand passion, principles win hands down. Rousing, yet tender speeches do not make our heroine forsake her creed to fall swooning and submissive into her alpha's arms. 
1. NO SEX!!!

When I was a little girl, I had a doll named Saloni. Now Saloni wasn't a particularly attractive specimen as dolls go, especially since, over the years, I had drilled a hole in her little rosebud mouth in order to 'feed' her, I had 'brushed' her hair till all the poor synthetic threads had fallen out and I had dragged her around with me so much, one of her big blue eyes had fallen off. But in my eyes, Saloni was the best doll ever created. She was my comfort, my mainstay in a world filled with confusing new things like school and daycare and other little people. Jane Eyre is my grown-up version of Saloni. Comfort food for my brain. 

There are two authors I will read over and over and over again, until the day I die. One of them is Charlotte Bronte, the other one is Georgette Heyer. I have read Jane Eyre a million times, but I never tire of the story. Every time I reach the scene where she professes her love to Mr. Rochester, I come out in goosebumps. Every single time. Age and experience have taught me to spot the flaws in the story and the characters. The ineffable belief in English superiority. The condescending attitude towards servants and people of the lower class. The ill-treatment of mentally disabled people. The almost Quaker-ish sentiments of Jane Eyre. But all of this detracts not a whit from one of the greatest love stories ever told. 

And there are a lot of things to admire in this book as well. Edward Rochester, ugly as sin, but powerful and dominant and unbelievably attractive in spite of his looks. A love that grows and strengthens on the basis of mutual sympathy, respect and a meeting of the minds, that a lot of our authors would do well to learn from. Jane Eyre, who does not think that her great love excuses acts of selfishness and immorality. Despite being drawn as a somewhat submissive personality, Jane manages to hold her own with quiet fortitude, never loudly asserting her intelligence or talent, but nonetheless displaying a strength of character that would put the Bellas and Noras of out time to shame. 

Jane Eyre would never, as I have said above, be a bestseller if it had been written in our times. And that is a loss we must take upon ourselves. That we have put such prime value on lust and looks and power that we have forgotten to be real in our writing. There is a reason why millions of people the world over remember and revere a book written a hundred and fifty-odd years ago while the bestsellers of our times slip quickly and quietly from our memories. Jane Eyre is more than just a beautiful book about a love story that transcends all boundaries; it is a testament to the power of pure emotion, that can be felt through the ages and across all barriers of time and culture."
775,Magrat Ajostiernos,Gone with the Wind,"Apr 07, 2018",5,"Enamorada de esta novela y de sus personajes. Una historia √©pica y enormemente emotiva, con sus claros y oscuros, pero que te hace re√≠r, sufrir, llorar y so√±ar como solo lo logran las grandes novelas

776,Emily (Books with Emily Fox),City of Bones ,"Jul 29, 2016",2,"I like to come back to books I've read years ago and give you the real tea so here it is...

Reading this books as a grown ass woman was an interesting experience. As a kid, I would always pick the biggest fantasy book I could find in a store because it meant more to read. As an adult, I realized that so many popular YA books are fluffy just for the sake of it.

The writing isn't that great nor are the characters, I found it very ""info dumpy"", also, I don't care for love triangles and really resent them when they involve a ""friend zone boy friend"".

If you've read this as a teenager, you'll have a much better time than I did.

Also... (view spoiler)[revealing that her crush is her brother is the worst ""twist"" I've ever read. I haven't finished the series but it's obviously not true and just added to compensate for the lack of plot. That's just so embarrassing. (hide spoiler)]"
777,Sean Barrs,Pride and Prejudice,"Nov 02, 2016",5,"Society, with all its restrictive constructs, is one nasty piece of work. 

It comes with so many silly rules, so many silly expectations. Those of social station and wealth must be seen to marry someone of the same ‚Äúworth‚Äù regardless of the feelings involved; they must be seen to marry someone on their level of class structure. But what of love? What of passion? Should it be quenched because of these all-encompassing silly constructs? 

Austen doesn‚Äôt think so. 

Enter Darcy, a man who is royally pissed off; he has fallen in love with someone considered far beneath him, to declare his love for her is to step outside the realms of his supposed pedigree: it is a form of social death. So he is a man torn in two. At the route of things, he is a product of his society; consequently, he is affected by its values. Although he hates it all the same; thus, the long sullen silences, the seemingly moody and arrogant exchanges with Elizabeth. But it‚Äôs all the expression of a man struggling to deal with the raging tempest of emotions that have taken hold of his mind: his being. 

‚ÄúIn vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.‚Äù 



Indeed, Austen slowly reveals the dangers of false perception as she gradually peels away the mask of this stoic pillar of aristocracy, and underneath blossoms a misunderstood and sensitive soul. So the romance plot is born. Elizabeth eventually loses her prejudice and sees through Darcy‚Äôs false pride. Darcy loses his integrated construct of prejudice and ignores the pride of his relatives. As ever with Austen, the title of the work is suggestive of the main motifs; she‚Äôs never subtle as its all ways clear which way her razor sharp sarcasm is pointed. 

So love conquers all. Austen was a strong advocate of social mobility, and often it‚Äôs based upon love in her works. But she only believes in real love. She‚Äôs not interested in fleeting moments of heat and sexual lust; she portrays true and lasting romantic attachments, relationships that are strong and real. For her, such things transcend class boundaries, wealth and intelligence. Love is love. It doesn‚Äôt matter who it is with as long as it is real; hence, Austen becomes a critique of society and its customs that prevent these relationships from being realised. She knows how stupid it is, and she loves to poke fun of her caricatures of the old stilted class of her era: the ones that resist her ideas. 

 Is this the best Austen? 

I did really enjoy this book, and I have given it five stars, but it‚Äôs not as good as her other works. For me it lacks the moral growth of  Northanger Abbey  and Emma.It lacks the conciseness of Persuasion. The emphasis on the injustice of romance has made it popular, though I do strongly believe that the love in Persuasion is stronger than it is here. That endures rejection, separation, war and decades; yet, it still lingers. I love Austen, and I have loved each one of her books I‚Äôve read so far in different ways. I hope to continue to do so. This is the fourth Austen I‚Äôve given five stars, I can easily celebrate her as one of my favourite writers.

‚ÄúStay gold, Ponyboy, stay gold.‚Äù


I'M NOT CRYING, YOU ARE.

Ok, before I get to the review, I would like to say a couple things. This book was read for school! So in school, we were given 5 books, and had to choose one book to read for a literature study.

The choices were:
The Hobbit, or There and Back Again
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
Copper Sun
The Outsiders
The Giver

Now, you might be asking why I chose this book, and that's because I found this book in my recommendations a while back! So, I would like to thank Izzy for recommending this book to me, I really loved it! <3

Now...onto the review:

I really loved this book! I did not expect to like it, because, well my school usually doesn't pick good books for us to read. But, I did have higher hopes than usual since this was recommended by Izzy. :) I was not disappointed!

Let's start with the 
plot!

PonyBoy, the main character, is a Greaser. They are more like outsiders of their town, having to watch their back against Socs. Socs, or Socials, are the people with the money, and the richer folk who can get away with anything. The Socs and Greasers are at constant battle, always fighting with each other. 

But, PonyBoy it proud to be a Greaser. Even though his life is rough, he has his family to keep him company. His family consists of his two brothers, Soda and Darry, and some friends considered family, like Steve, Two-Bit, Dally, and Johnny.

So life is good, PonyBoy goes to school, and hangs out with the gang. However, everything changes when his friend Johnny, kills a Soc (not a spoiler, it's in the synopsis). Some Socs jump PonyBoy and Johnny, and one of them tries to drown PonyBoy. Johnny then has no choice but to kill him. He never intended to kill, but what's done is done.

PonyBoy and Johnny then have to adjust to the criminal life. They run away to a different town, and hide. This is basically half the plot, but Hinton really makes the plot interesting!

In the next half of the book, there is a fire in a building, and children are in the building. Johnny, PonyBoy, and Dally (who met them in the church later), go in to save the children. Then, they go from criminals to heroes. So this half of the book is very different, as they are adjusting to their new selves.

But, there's a problem. Johnny and Dally? They got injured in the fire, and are now in the hospital. There's no guarantee whether they will survive or not. 

This worries the crap out of the gang. And many shocking events follow.

The plot twists were quite interesting with this one! I was quite shocked when (view spoiler)[Randy refused to fight the greasers. (hide spoiler)] It also totally broke my heart when (view spoiler)[Johnny died. You see the quote in my review? Those were Johnny's last words. (hide spoiler)] I was literally in tears when (view spoiler)[Dally killed himself because of Johnny's death. (hide spoiler)]

The plot was really good, made me quite emotional. But what made me more emotional was the fact that I could connect to these characters.


Let's move onto the 
characters:


I really enjoyed the characters! I found that I could connect with some of them, and I love characters whom I can emotionally relate to.

PonyBoy: Our main character! PonyBoy is the youngest of his 2 brothers, Soda and Darry. He is a kind guy, not your typical greaser. He enjoys reading and watching sunsets. So you can see why I could connect with him lol. But anyways, PonyBoy grows up with the gang, and is the youngest of the group. I honestly thought being in his head was quite interesting. 

He thought some pretty deep things. Throughout the book, he talked about books he read, and how they applied to real life. And the way he thought them, it wasn't like reading a textbook. It was actually interesting. Who knew analyzing poetry could be interesting? XD

I definitely saw a lot of growth in him throughout the book. In the beginning of the book, he was an uncertain boy who loved to read. Now, our PonyBoy has grown up so much! Look at him, giving wise saying and thinking smart things. He is so much more confident of himself and I'm proud of him!

Soda: Soda holds a special place in my heart. He is the middle child of the three brothers. He quit school, because he claims he was too dumb, and works at a gas station. 

Soda is so supportive, it's very sweet. When PonyBoy was sent to the hospital, he was the first one there. When PonyBoy was in the dark, Soda turned on the light for him. He really helped PonyBoy in a way I found really sweet. This is the definition of the best sibling relationship.

Soda definitely grew too! In my opinion he was perfect at the beginning, but at the end, he definitely became more mature and more responsible. Rooting for him!

Darry: Darry was...interesting. I didn't like him at first to be honest. He was bossy, and seemed to have something against PonyBoy. Darry is the oldest of the brothers. He could have gone to college, but he left school to get money to support the gang.

That sounds great, but he was so harsh to PonyBoy, and clearly favored Soda over him. But, as the story progressed on, he grew on me. I found out that he really did care for PonyBoy, he just did not know how to express it. 

When PonyBoy was in the hospital, after Soda, Darry was the second one to show up. It was such an emotion scene when (view spoiler)[the two brothers hugged. (hide spoiler)] I could really sense that they finally understood each other.

So did Darry grow? Heck yeah! He grew from an emotionless, tough rock to a caring big brother. He definitely changed a lot through the book, and I'm proud of his transformation!

Dally: I hated Dally with pure hatred at first as well. He harassed girls, committed crimes, and had a crazy criminal record. He was tough, and nothing got to him. I saw him as kind of evil. 

But, only at the end, when (view spoiler)[Dally killed himself, (hide spoiler)] I caught a glimpse of him. He wasn't unbreakable. He wasn't evil. This was just his way of life. The reason he (view spoiler)[killed himself (hide spoiler)] was because he was in grief. (view spoiler)[Johnny's death (hide spoiler)] finally broke him and that's how he dealt with it.

He is now one of my favorite characters, even though he broke my heart. :(

Johnny: He also has a special place in my heart! Who am I kidding? All these characters are special! Johnny is considered the ""pet"" of the gang, second youngest to PonyBoy. 

He had very low self-esteem, because the Socs gave him a really bad beating one day. His parents didn't want him, so his gang was his family. I wouldn't say he was happy like PonyBoy, he really wanted his family to love him.

When Johnny killed the Soc, he changed completely. He was scared of himself. But, when PonyBoy and Johnny run away together, he definitely grew.

When he was caught in the fire and ended up in the hospital, he became more sure of himself, and learned to love himself. Unfortunately, (view spoiler)[he did not survive. I feel so sad he didn't get a happy ending. He totally deserved it. :( (hide spoiler)]

Overall, Johnny was an amazing character, whom I will never forget.

To conclude, I really loved the characters! Too bad this isn't a sequel to this book, I would have loved to see more of them! <3


Moving on to the 
writing!


The writing was quite simplistic, but it still holds a special place in my heart. There was a lot of slang, and I honestly appreciated it. A lot of authors make the characters talk so formally, it gets unrealistic. Hinton has the characters talk in a very casual tone, and it had its own charm.

I have nothing more to say about the writing, but I really loved it!

Overall, I really loved this book. It covered some very deep topics such as empathy, honor, identity, and divided communities. I honestly learned a lot from this book. Really? Who would have ever thought a fiction book could teach you something? Believe or not, it did.

Thank you S.E. Hinton, this was a masterpiece.

This was absolutely amazing and heart-breaking. Review to come."
779,Trish,A Wrinkle in Time,"Feb 08, 2018",5,"We all want to fit in somehow. We also want to be ourselves and thus stand out a little bit, but basically we don't want to deviate too much from ""the norm"" because it's usually considered bad by others (funny, considering that we're pretty much all feeling the same way so we should just let the others be) and especially children often have a hard time when not fitting in with their peers. Thus, being different can be risky.

Meg is a girl that doesn't fit in. Her parents are multiple PhDs and have taught her and her siblings a thing or two (about maths mostly) with the result that Meg can often not understand why she is supposed to solve a (mathematical) problem in school this way instead of that. The problem is that neither her teachers nor the other kids in school are thrilled with what her parents have already taught her and she is therefore subject to verbal bullying from both groups.
Meg has three brothers: twins (Sandy and Dennys) and Charles Wallace. The former two know how to play the game and usually don't let anything get to them. The latter is 5 years old and usually doesn't speak at all because he knows full well that his correct and adult way of speaking - to say nothing of knowing peoples' minds - would freak others out. He prefers letting them think he cannot speak and is ""dumb"". He's also Meg's confidant and (thanks to his ability) always knows what she and their mother need.
The children live in a house with their mother who conducts experiments in a room off the kitchen. Sadly, the childrens' father has been missing for over a year, leaving the family emotionally desperate. He worked with the government and there isn't any information the family is given by way of explanation. The cruel people of town speak about him having left for another woman, which doesn't make Meg feel any better, of course. In fact, Meg hates people for being so unfair and ignorant and she frequently grows impatient with the way things are (leading to her getting into trouble).
Thanks to her gifted brother Charles Wallace, the family encounters a peculiar old woman called Mrs. Whatsit. The following day, Meg and Charles Wallace not only meet Mrs. Whatsit's sister (Mrs. Who) but also a boy from school - a popular boy, Calvin, who nevertheless seems to have enough troubles of his own and reveals to only be popular because he is what everyone expects of him without it really being him.

To go into such detail about the children is important to me because they are the central characters. Sure, Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who are important as well and the kids meet other creatures besides them, but the author managed to truly write a story for and about children.

Anyway, at one point, the three ladies reveal to Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin that they want to help getting back Meg's and Charles Wallace's father because he is in great peril. Thus, they take them on a fantastic journey through several galaxies.

It's a tale of all your faults being necessary at the right time if you can apply them properly, of perseverance, love, and self-sacrifice. It's about the darkness in the world and that we can't simply do nothing, even if that might seem seductively easier. It's also about celebrating who you are instead of homogenizing the entire world.
Camazotz, a world the children travel to while trying to find their father, is the perfect example of what happens when everyone has to be like everybody else. Not only does it make the world grey and dull, it also does not make the people in it happy.
This is definitely a tale I'd read to my children if I had any, because it teaches so much about people, the world, perception, and looking beyond the surface. It's also about compassion and intelligence and hard lessons that all people need to learn at one point in their lives or another and the author had a wonderful way of not only delighting me when I travelled to distant planets with the children, but of also breaking my heart once or twice.

I loved the prose, I loved the author's imagination, I loved the children and everyone they encountered for the colourful worlds they inhabited and their strangeness. I loved how the interaction of light and dark was portrayed, how our way of seeing the world was challenged, and the fact that the book was filled with scientific topics, explained so children could understand them. In the introduction to my edition, the author said that the book had been rejected many times, usually because nobody could tell what it was (it was as different as its main characters) and the publishers said that children would never ""get it"" - to which the author commented that children usually perceive much more than adults, and her own children (demanding more writing from her) were proof enough for her to persevere. I therefore love her self-imposed high standard to make this a tale for children, about children, that nevertheless equally thrills thanks to the adventure and educates through the imbedded facts. It is rather fascinating even though there are plenty of religious themes embedded as well (though much more subtly than C.S. Lewis did in most of his books).

I have the audiobook that was read by Hope Davis and was delighted about her narration. I've listened to a number of audiobooks lately but she must be one of the top 3 narrators I've heard so far and I hope she's narrated the rest of the series as well. 
Because this is a quintet and while you could technically regard this as a standalone, it literally ends in the middle of a sentence from Mrs. Whatsit which caught me by complete surprise and left me wanting more (nice touch). *lol*"

784,Anne,Of Mice and Men,"May 04, 2021",4,"Oh shit. Don't laugh at me but I just now got this:

 

Of Mice & Men has been on my bucket list for a while. It's one of those stories that are kind of everywhere, but somehow I've still managed to avoid spoilers for the past 45 years.
How?
I'm going to go out on a long shaky limb and say it's probably because nothing about me lends itself to paying any attention to mopey books about ranch hands.

 

Steinbeck covers a lot of ground in this relatively small tale. The casually horrible racism, the plight of a man who has the mind of a child, and the bleak outlook for the poor and uneducated once they've passed their point of usefulness. And of course, those painted tarts that flirt and wreck a man's sanity. <--somehow it doesn't surprise me that the hoe was the villain of the piece.

 

So. The moral of the story is that you shouldn't pet animals too hard or they'll get all dead and floppy, don't be a mean skank because nobody wants to catch herpes from a complete bitch, and sometimes you just need to shoot a guy in the head to be nice.
That's it, right? Right?
Or. 
Maybe the moral of the story is just that sometimes, no matter how hard you try, shit just goes sideways.

 

Yes, it was poignant and worth reading. But more important to me, it was blessedly short. I don't think I would have wanted to endure living in that depressing story for any longer than I did.

I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.
Jay Gatsby is rich - the kind of exorbitant rich that other rich people like to hang out with him, just so they can bask in his richness.

He's also in love, with one Daisy Buchanan...who's already married to one, surly, cheating and backstabbing man.

Our narrator has front row seats to all the glitz, the glam and the gore that circles around Jay Gatsby's chaotic life. (Cause, whenever you throw that much money at something, you better be prepared for something to be thrown back.)

Overall, I liked this one better the second time around. I'm a bit more familiar with the story, and I have more of a feel for the way Fitzgerald writes.

I really enjoy the character of Gatsby this time around and love Daisy a little bit less.

The one thing I disliked in round 1 (and have disliked every time I go through this novel) is the language. It just seems...SO over-the-top and flowery. 

It really just takes forever to say anything in this book. Like this: 
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
and this:
It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.
 AND THIS: 
Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
Ultimately, this one was not the one for me. Maybe I'll give it another shot in a couple of years...

789,Virginia Ronan ‚ô• Herondale ‚ô•,Lord of the Flies,"May 04, 2018",4,"‚ÄùThey accepted the pleasures of morning, the bright sun, the whelming sea and sweet air, as a time when play was good and life so full that hope was not necessary and therefore forgotten.‚Äù

So this was a book many people had to read when they went to school and in some way this already says a lot about ‚ÄúLord of the Flies‚Äù. Like so many of the books that are required to be read during people‚Äôs educational careers this one wasn‚Äôt only full of serious topics but also dealt with ethical values.

I mean we have boys between the ages of 6 and 12 who are stranded on an island after they had a plane crash. There is no adult who would force them to stay in line; there is no authority that would tell them what's right or wrong. They are left to their own devices and even though they were doing as good as you would expect schoolboys to do, they still were fairly decent at the beginning of the book. 

‚ÄúI agree with Ralph. We‚Äôve got to have rules and obey them. After all, we‚Äôre not savages. We‚Äôre English; and the English are the best at everything. So we‚Äôve got to do the right things.‚Äù 

Oh, how often I thought back to this quote when I read on with horror, every new chapter revealing another aspect of the dark abyss of human kind. The morale dilemma of Ralph and Piggy was so intense that I couldn‚Äôt help but feel with them whenever something bad and terrible happened. They were the only ones that tried to get order into the chaos but on an island without any rules only the strongest remain. 

‚ÄùI got you meat!‚Äù
Numberless and inexpressible frustrations combined to make his rage elemental and awe-inspiring. ‚ÄúI painted my face ‚Äì I stole up. Now you eat ‚Äì all of you ‚Äì and I ‚Äì‚Äú

The fight of savageness vs. civilisation was so tangible it hurt and I constantly found myself sitting at the edge of my seat hoping against all hope, that civilisation would actually win. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to know that it didn‚Äôt. Why hold on to moral standards? Why listen to reason if you can have a kingdom of your own? Why should you accept someone else‚Äôs opinion if you‚Äôre stronger and can force them to obey your own rules? You know it better than the others, right?!

‚ÄùIf I blow the conch and they don‚Äôt come back; then we‚Äôve had it. We shan‚Äôt keep the fire going. We‚Äôll be like animals. We‚Äôll never be rescued.‚Äù

I know I‚Äôm being provocative here but it is how it is. The strongest will always try to rule the weak. It‚Äôs been done for centuries and I doubt that it will ever stop. It‚Äôs as much a part of human nature as breathing and let‚Äôs face the bitter truth: There‚Äôs darkness in all of us. We can only decide if we fight it or let it in. ;-) 

‚ÄùLook, Ralph. We got to forget this. We can‚Äôt do no good thinking about it, see?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm frightened. Of us. I want to go home. O god I want to go home.‚Äù

‚ÄùThe thing is ‚Äì fear can‚Äôt hurt you any more than a dream. There aren‚Äôt any beasts to be afraid of on this island.‚Äù

If you ask me there certainly was a monster on the island or should I rather say that there were monsters? 
Plural.
 It weren‚Äôt monsters that had been there all along though. No, it were the monsters that had fallen from the sky, claiming the island as their own, doing as they pleased because they could do so without anyone to stop them. The monsters on the island came from the outside and despite their claims to want to get off of the island they all knew that they actually wanted to stay. 

‚ÄùI‚Äôm scared of him,‚Äù said Piggy, ‚Äúand that‚Äôs why I know him. If you‚Äôre scared of someone you hate him but you can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. You kid yourself he‚Äôs all right really, an‚Äô then when you see him again; it‚Äôs like asthma an‚Äô you can‚Äôt breathe.‚Äù

So in the end things took their natural course and got worse and worse. The descent into savageness was inexorable and the book ended on a heavy note. I can only speak for myself but the ending was brilliant. Brilliant and shocking and so very, very realistic that it caused me to ache even more. Those stupid boys... those stupid, stupid little boys. *shakes head*

Anyway, if you want to read a really good book which will haunt you days after you finished it, this should be your choice. *lol* After all I finished ‚ÄúLord of the Flies‚Äù almost a week ago and I‚Äôm still thinking about it. ;-)

Happy Reading! I hope you‚Äôll enjoy it as well! 

(view spoiler)[Those are two quotes that were perfect and moved me so damn much when I read the book. Because they would spoil too much and would give away some crucial parts of the plot I didn‚Äôt write them down in the actual review though. 
Anyway if you read the book already you might as well enjoy them now:

‚ÄùPiggy.‚Äù
‚ÄúUh?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat was Simon.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou said that before.‚Äù
‚ÄúPiggy.‚Äù
‚ÄúUh?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat was murder.‚Äù

‚ÄùAnd in the middle of them, Ralph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man‚Äôs heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.‚Äù (hide spoiler)]"
790,April,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Mar 19, 2008",5,"I adore this book. I love it with all my heart. The first few pages were a delight, a surprise, and from then on it was a sweet love affair. I wanted both to have read the book all at once and also to have it all yet unread so I could savor it. I simply didn't want it to end.

The story is about two people, the time traveler and his wife. On the surface, they are like any two people who love each other in modern times, except for the fact that he travels through time. You'd think that fact would make this science fiction, but this is more a romance -- actually, more a great love story than anything. A love that transcends time.

While the science fiction part of it IS interesting, it really is all about the couple, Henry and Clare. Henry's ability to time travel almost becomes a metaphor. For what? Whatever it is a reader wishes to imagine. But there'd be no story without it, as it's very intricately woven into the romance. It's unlikely they ever would have met and come together without it.

Henry and Clare both tell the story in their first person points of view, in the present tense, to indicate the here and now, though the scenes might be all at once the past, the present, and the future. They take turns, not only in telling the story, but in knowing what's to come. So the story unfolds like a flower, with each scene a petal of rosy revelation, where you see both sides -- first the outside, then the inside -- as it blooms and shows yet another petal within, ready to unfurl.

The plotting is amazing. Things that happened in one's past, halfway mentioned, become a foreshadowing of what's to come for another, and in the end, things just fall into place; bad or good, you know that whatever just happened was supposed to happen. You can't really worry about the paradoxes, though. You just have to let go of the feeling that something might never have happened were it not for one thing or another. However tangled up the cause and effect become, the whole thing seemed fated and comes full circle.

I suspect that this book inspired the TV series Journeyman, which I also love. However, they have made it light years easier for the time traveler in Journeyman. When Henry time travels, he brings nothing with him. He can't. Anything that isn't a part of his body is left behind, so he arrives naked and must steal clothes and shoes. When the man in Journeyman travels, he takes with him whatever he is wearing or holding, so he has his clothes and his cash. When Henry time travels, he is unable to change anything that, for him, has already happened. When the Journeyman time travels, it is expressly so he can go back and change the past, and when he returns to his present, things are not quite what they were when he left.

And even though the science fiction part of this book is actually fairly understated, Henry's version of time travel seems much more real to me, more plausible. His life with Clare makes it even more so because we see how it affects the two of them and their relationship with each other and with other people. Only the media seems left out of it, and I think that if Henry's ability was real, it would be very much in the media in one form or another.

I really wish I could articulate everything that I love about this book, but I think the best way to share what I'm feeling for the book right now is to recommend it to everyone I know.

Hints of Lolita again, but sweeter and more innocent.

791,Chrissy,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,"Jul 28, 2022",5,"I'm pretty sure everyone knows what these books are about. Both Alice's stories are completely bonkers and very much loved. I've read them many, many times over the years, they are part of the reason I got hooked on reading as a child and remain among my favourites of all time. Disney took elements of both the stories to create the classic Alice In Wonderland film, which was originally released on this day in 1951.
Put on some Jefferson Airplane and read them if you haven't!"
792,Allie,The Outsiders,"Feb 16, 2008",4,This was a great book but I was incredibly disappointed after I found out it wasn't about aliens.
793,Lisa of Troy,Dracula,"Oct 31, 2022",1,"Friend John, this should have been a short story!

Dracula is a spooky story which begins with Jonathan Harker, an attorney who travels to Transylvania to help his client, Count Dracula, purchase a home in London. However, Dracula is behaving strangely. Will Jonathan make it out alive?

Holy smokes! This book is B-O-R-I-N-G! No wonder there are so many Dracula books and movies because almost anyone else could have done it better!

The book itself has an interesting format‚Äîit is told through various characters‚Äô journals, telegrams, and letters. 

But---oh, the writing style! Huge, long, gigantic paragraphs! Dracula reminded me of The Scarlett Letter because, although it did have some interesting elements, it was so long and drawn out. If the filler was cut out, it would have made a compelling short story. 

‚ÄúFriend John‚Äù was mentioned so many times‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

This is a book that is so poorly written that I am confident that I could write something better. Apparently, I am not alone in this thought as there have been many, many other versions.

794,K.D. Absolutely,The Secret Garden,"Aug 08, 2009",4,"I am now confused. I do not know anymore what is my preference when it comes to books.

When I was a kid, I wanted to read only books with pictures like the illustrated ""Alice in the Wonderland"" or ""Rip Van Winkle"". Until I read ""Silas Marner"" with no pictures and I said, wow, books with no pictures are also great! 

When I was a teenager, I said I don't like to read books that are hard to understand and read by adults until I read ""Lolita"" by Vladimir Nabokov and I said, wow, I did not know that there are authors who write this way! 

When I was a young man, I said I do not want thick books because I do not have time for them until I read ""War and Peace"" and ""The Fountainhead"" and I said, wow, thick books can be really engaging and finishing them can give you a different high! 

When I became a husband, my sex life became busy, I stopped heavy reading and concentrated on my job (not on copulating you silly) so I just grabbed some easy-read bestsellers like ""The Da Vinci Code"", ""The Kite Runner"" until my daughter came and I had to read some children's books to her and she loved them but I secretly hated them until I read to her ""The Little Prince"" and said, wow, there are still children's books that can speak to me even if I am a grown up man!

When I became a middle-aged man, I discovered Goodreads. There is an option to screen members who apply to become your friend by asking the applicant a question. I thought then that the choice of genre was important so I chose this question: What is your favorite literary genre?"" and from then on, I have been accepting and ignoring invites based on his/her answer. I generally don't accept invites from people who say they don't have any preference. I thought that that kind of answer is wishy-washy or indecisive that reflects his or her not being a serious reader.

Prior to last year, I said, I don't want to read fantasy books. I am too old for that. Until, I read the whole series of J.R.R.Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and I say, wow, wow, wow, I did not know that I could still be amazed by a fantasy book about wizards, trolls, flying horse, monsters and little creatures! 

This book, The Secret Garden is a kind of book that I would not even consider reading. It is neither a 501 nor a 1001 book. The reason why I read this is that it is one of the Top 100 Favorite Books of The Filipino Group here at Goodreads. We challenged ourselves to read all the chosen books so I gave this a try.

Story-wise, it is too sweeet. Saccharine corny. Predictable. Inappropriate for a middle-age man like me. Almost insulting to intelligence: feisty girl turns sweet girl. Sickly unwanted boy turns healthy. Then the boy and father embrace each other and profess love for one another. Hu hu hu. Books can just hit you without any warning. I was sad yet happy when I closed this book this morning. I think I am going crazy reading different books and experience all the different emotions while reading them. 

So I don't know anymore. I don't know what I like in books. No more preferences. Ask me now, what is my favorite genre. I don't know. 

But, the writing in this book is flawless. I have attended a novel-writing workshop last year and all the ingredients of a good novel are here: well-developed characters, each of them has his/her own distinct voice and transforming towards the end, milieu (the garden) is clearly described and very significant in the story, the internal and external conflicts are arranged like small-to-tall majorettes in a parade, the hooks at the end of each chapter, the climax, the falling action, the denouement ties up the loose ends from the conflicts. The theme is solid. The lessons, though corny, are school-textbook-kind of reminders: that love is important to make this world a better place and nature is beautiful so we have to take care of it.

I guess my realization is this: yes, at some points in our lives, we tend to prefer some literary genres over the others. However, the genre is secondary to the writing. If the writer is good, no matter in which genre the book belongs, he/she should be read.


It is not the genre, it is the writing."
795,jessica,Little Women,"Jun 12, 2012",4,"that feeling when you spend the majority of the book desperately longing to be a jo, but then end up realising youre actually just a beth‚Ä¶ :/

also, the fact that i still like laurie, even after he messes around in france trying to ‚Äúfind himself,‚Äù says a lot more about me than it does about him, to be fair.

and dont even get me started on the new film coming out. the casting definitely has me feeling some kind of way. im still not over the precision of timoth√©e chalamet as laurie, the literary character who embodies so many young peoples first experience with f-boi heartbreak. i mean, will you just LOOK at my son!?

796,Jessaka,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,"Jan 26, 2018",2,"I was noticing a new friend‚Äôs book shelf and how he likes children‚Äôs books just as I do. He had read Alice in Wonderland. I had read it as a child. I ask myself: Did I really like that book back then? Was it just given to me and that was all I had to read? Did my mother pick my books? And why were they always a certain kind of book, like Cinderella and The Wizard of Oz? Why were they not Robinson and Crusoe and Treasure Island? 

I can‚Äôt imagine liking these books now. I don‚Äôt like fantasy except say for Tolkien, but that may be unfair since I have not really tried any outside of Mockingjay, which I hated, but I read it because I was in a book group, not that I read everything they threw at me, which means I hated most. 

As to Alice, who cares about a girl who takes pills, and how one pill made her larger and one pill made her small? The song was good, White Rabbit. Love Minus Zero was a far better song. Maybe this book would have been better if written by a hippie. 

Speaking of which, I was never in to taking drugs in the 60s or 70s. So. as for Alice in Wonderland, I never wanted to read it again or even analyze it to even know why the hippies loved the book, or even if they did. Still, I liked the hippies, those back to the landers, that is, those who didn't sit around stoned all day. 

And back to my youth: I read everything. I read labels, cereal boxes, bill boards, and I loved those Burma Shave signs along the highways, where one sign said: Shave the modern way, and one sign said: No brush. The next sign said, No lather / No rub-in / Big tube 35 cents - Drug stores / Burma-Shave. I say, Who can beat that?

When I grew older I always tried to see what a stranger was reading, the book in their hands. Sometimes I would ask. When I was in college I began collecting children‚Äôs books because I hadn‚Äôt read them as a child. Wind in the Willow was one I bought, but I never read it. I wondered why my mother didn‚Äôt take me to the library earlier in my life and stock me up on children‚Äôs books. I grew up with deprivation of environment, I thought. Maybe it was because she had just gone through a divorce when I was 8 years old and had to work, get her life back together. I only remember that as a teenager, we went together to the library sometmes. We read Bridey Murphy and Lost Books of the Bible and wondered if reincarnation was real, and why wasn‚Äôt Jesus‚Äô childhood in the Bible and where did Cain get his wife.

And then in my early teens, I found the section of books about mountain people. I have no idea what attracted me to this genre. I do know that there was a wonderful librarian, a woman, who, when I came up to the desk and asked for more books on the mountain people would lead me to them. And now I know, a lightbulb just went off in my head. It was her that introduced me to my first book about mountain people. It was The Shepherd of the Hills, and then she took me to The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, or it was the other way around. Then came Gene Stratton-Porter, and next it was the Bald Knobbers, and all by myself I found Tobacco Road, which my mother took away, telling me that it was a dirty book. Next, I was reading one about the area where I lived, The Salinas: Upside Down River, and years later a friend gave it to me without realizing that I had read it. I got into the Nancy Drew and the Dana Sisters next, liking the latter series better. I loved westerns and read most on their shelves. I read about the outlaws and how Jesse James came to Paso Robles where I lived. I read one that I could never find again: The main character was a sheriff or a marshal, and his name was Jack Slader. I still wish that I could find it. Next, I was into the non-fiction books, veterinarian medicine, how to increase your memory and who knows what all. I wanted to know everything. I just didn't want to know about Alice or Cinderella or even Peter Pan anymore.

This reminds me of a older man who used to come into the library who talked with me. It probably wasn‚Äôt often, but I knew him just because he was around. He told me that he wanted to learn every word in the dictionary and then go on The Millionaire and get rich. I thought how good it would be to increase my own vocabulary, but it was always so boring, so I never got past Aardvark and used to call my brother one. If only the other words were just as interesting.

Then I met the man who cleaned up the park where the library was located. He showed me the pond with the mosquito fish that was hidden in the trees and gave me some for my aquarium. He showed me pine nuts and said that they were good to eat. He even showed me how I could find them in pine cones, that is, if the squirrels hadn‚Äôt gathered them first. And last of all he showed me how all the trees in the park had name tags in English and in Latin. 

So, yes, my mother had to work to support us kids, and I heard a lot of ‚ÄúGo out and play,‚Äù by my older sister who quit high school to take care of us, and that I did. That part was wonderful because I could go anywhere in town, to the library, down to the river with my dog or into the hills where I would sometimes come home with poison oak. I remember how I explored every shop in town, every corner, every street, even the alleys where people had wonderful gardens. One day my friend Mary and I went into the Mercantile to try on men‚Äôs hats. We told the clerk that we wanted to buy our dads a hat, and the clerk didn‚Äôt even care, although we knew that he didn‚Äôt believe us. Exploring was fun.

But as for this book, I would never think to read it again even though I have long missed watching Disney World on our TV on Sundays nights. What do I watch instead, The Walking Dead. My how times have changed."

798,Crumb,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Feb 05, 2018",2,"What can I say about a book that is hailed as one of the greatest pieces of fiction of all time? Nothing. I really can't. I will not disrespect this book by saying anything negative about it. I think my opinions about this book may have changed over the years, but that by no means makes this a poor read. Instead of being critical about the book, I am going to celebrate it with some of my favorite quotes from this book:

‚ÄúLike and equal are not the same thing at all.‚Äù 
(No wonder this book is considered to be allegorical! Definitely some political innuendo there..)

‚ÄúHave you ever tried to get to your feet with a sprained dignity?‚Äù

‚ÄúA book, too, can be a star, ‚Äúexplosive material, capable of stirring up fresh life endlessly,‚Äù a living fire to lighten the darkness, leading out into the expanding universe.

‚ÄúIf we knew ahead of time what was going to happen we‚Äôd be‚Äîwe‚Äôd be like the people on Camazotz, with no lives of our own, with everything all planned and done for us.‚Äù 

And for my absolute favorite quote:

‚ÄúLife, with its rules, its obligations, and its freedoms, is like a sonnet: You're given the form, but you have to write the sonnet yourself. - Mrs. Whatsit‚Äù 

This book is a masterpiece. However, it simply didn't resonate with my older self as it had with my younger self. With that said, I can still recognize this for what it was: A book ahead of its time that was extremely controversial. It has seen much success and has been exulted by fans everywhere."
799,Brian,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Nov 14, 2007",5,"One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a tremendous piece of literature. It's not an easy read. You're not going to turn its pages like you would the latest John Grisham novel, or The DaVinci Code. You have to read each page, soaking up every word, immersing yourself in the imagery. Mr. Marquez says that he tells the story as his grandmother used to tell stories to him: with a brick face. That's useful to remember while reading, because that is certainly the tone the book takes. If you can get through the first 50 pages, you will enjoy it. But those 50 are a doozy. It's hard to keep track of the characters, at times (mainly because they are all named Jose Arcadio or Aureliano), but a family tree at the beginning of my edition was helpful. The book follows the Buendia family, from the founding of fictional Macondo to a fitting and fulfilling conclusion. The family goes through wars, marriages, many births and deaths, as well as several technological advances and invasions by gypsies and banana companies (trust me, the banana company is important). You begin to realize, as matriarch Ursula does, that as time passes, time does not really pass for this family, but turns in a circle. And as the circle closes on Macondo and the Buendias, you realize that Mr. Marquez has taken you on a remarkable journey in his literature. Recommended, but be prepared for a hard read."
800,‚ùÑÔ∏èBooksofRadiance‚ùÑÔ∏è,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Jul 21, 2018",3,"Loved the book and the writing but there was something about it that I passionately disliked as well. 
I can‚Äôt explain it as I myself don‚Äôt understand it but it definitely hindered my enjoyment to the full. 

I was also somewhat take aback by my sheer dislike for Sayuri. I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who actively disliked her to this extent but there were moments where I felt so infuriated by her, by her selfishness, her utter lack of loyalty, her self-importance... I just couldn‚Äôt stand her."

802,Jasmine from How Useful It Is,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Mar 16, 2018",5,"About: A Wrinkle in Time is a children‚Äôs science fiction written by Madeleine L‚ÄôEngle. It was published on 3/15/1973 by Yearling Books, paperback, 211 pages. The genres are children‚Äôs, science fiction, and fantasy. This book is intended for readers ages 10 to 14. This book belongs to a series of 5 books.

My Experience: I started reading A Wrinkle in Time on 3/13/18 and finished it on 3/16/18. This book is fantastic! I love the characters! They all have unique personalities. I like the twin‚Äôs good sense of humor. I like their easy going intelligent parents and the oddities of Meg and Charles Wallace. I like that despite the characters being super smart, that they seem to have a disability in others. Charles Wallace is a genius but he didn‚Äôt speak until he was 4 years old. Meg is excellent at math but she is a trouble student at school. It‚Äôs a good reminder that even geniuses are still not perfect. I read this book to watch the remake of A Wrinkle in Time. I have seen the old version of the movie years ago and some events came back to me as I read this book.

This book is told in the third person point of view following Margaret (Meg) Murry as she experiences one of the lowest days of her life. Her grades are suffering, the mean girls at school are saying she‚Äôs acting like a baby, and she has gotten herself into a fight to protect her youngest brother, Charles Wallace though her middle twin brothers, Sandy and Dennys weren‚Äôt appreciative of her efforts. Now the storm is scaring her. The storm brought in one of their new strange neighbors, Mrs. Whatsit. To Meg and her mom‚Äôs surprise, Charles Wallace already gotten acquainted with the new neighbor. Mrs. Whatsit said a tesseract is real and it brought on a whole new adventure for Meg and Charles Wallace. This adventure involves rescuing their father, a renowned physicist. With the help of Mrs. Whatsit and her two friends Mrs.Which and Mrs. Who and Meg‚Äôs classmate, Calvin, they were able to travel by tesser to far away planets.

A well written story, this book is full of adventures and wholesome characters for readers. I love the illustrations in this book that explains how traveling through tesser works. I like the mathematical references and the mentioning of Einstein. I like how Meg‚Äôs dad spent time to teach Meg math shortcuts and the periodic table of elements. I like Charles Wallace and his interest in higher learning at such a young age. I like the glimpse of Camazotz‚Äôs citizens, how everyone doing the same thing in a rhythmic motion. This book has a good family dynamic and the curiosity of the mind and I highly recommend everyone to read this book!

Pro: fast paced, page turner, easy to read, family oriented, other planets,

Con: none

I rate it 5 stars!

***Disclaimer: I borrowed this book from my local public library and my opinions are honest.

804,jessica,The Hunger Games ,"Jun 12, 2012",5,"personal anecdote - the first time i heard of this book was when i was 17. i was at work (i was a hostess at a restaurant in a mall) and my manager came up to me, gave me $20 and asked me to run to B&N to buy her a copy before they closed. she wanted me to do it because she said it 'would look better if a teenager bought it.'

i havent really thought about that day since but, since my time on goodreads, i cant believe how much shaming i see for adults who read books that are targeted for YA or children. what a shame it is that adults feel embarrassed to buy a book simply because its promoted as a story for teenagers!

as i reread this, 10 years later, i am even more convinced that people should read whatever they want to read and not feel bad for enjoying what they enjoy! 

also, gale totally deserves better. i thought it then and i still think it now. my boy is the true hero of this story. 

and that has been your PSA for the day!

***The Fault in Our Stars***

for me it's not a great story, But It's very lovable ,emotional somehow that I can't never say it isn't a great story...

I was afraid after 80% of the story,and not feeling emotional enough or teary eyes like EVERYONE's experience with the book , that I've grew a ""Hairy Heart"" like this story in J.K.Rowling's Harry Potter's Spin off:




But I have to say I liked the story more cause of Peter and his Novel ""An Imperial Affliction""  plot, and that's the main reason of Hazel and Augustus get together.
""and the fact I used ""Felicity""'s stars in the main roles ""I was just finished that book, you can know about the show at my review for that book""


But by the end -and again cause of Peter Van Houten's reappearance- I got ""teary eyes"" and uncontrollable one .. the wrapping of this plot hit me hard in heart..
Then the smooth ending ""Being in 14th July -MY BIRTHDAY :)"" with the lovely mother -who I really felt more emotions for her than expected too, I pictured her like Desperate Housewives' Bree Van De Kamp-

That's what make it goes from 3 stars to 4

So, yes I must read again for John Green.. And I'll never forget the days with Hazel and Gus..they'll be in my memory..
Always...

okay?

806,Melissa ‚ô• Dog/Wolf Lover ‚ô• Martin,Gone with the Wind,"Jan 31, 2015",5,"6/29/16 UPDATE: I have since watched the movie and although I really liked the movie, it doesn't hold a candle to the book. But you can imagine that a book this size can't be put into one movie sitting. And where the book made me cry a lot, the movie didn't.

I spent over 12 hours today finishing this book. 1037 pages! 1. Because I wanted to know what was going to happen! 2. I have no sort of life so I can do this from time to time.



I can not believe it took me so long to read this book! I didn't think it would be my kind of book and I have never watched the movie <---I did order the blu-ray on Amazon today because I have to see it soon! I must say that GOODREADS has been a blessing and a curse in this department. I have broadened my horizons since being on GOODREADS from reading books my friends are reading or have read and this is one of them. I would have missed out on this book! 

This book has so many feels for me:
Disgust
Sadness
Rage
Shock

I invested so much into so many characters. So many characters that died, that I loved... ones that didn't even have much of a role in the story, I loved them. I thought this was just a love story around the war, but it's so much more. Dear God, Margaret Mitchell knew how to write a book about it all. No holds barred! 

I have to make a small mention that I was born in Tennessee and it was so weird reading a bit part about Chattanooga (where I live now) in the book. I guess the biggest part was reading about the battle at Chickamauga, GA. I live 20 minutes from the Chickamauga Battlefield in Ga and used to hike it for many years with my dog and my father until things in my life went wrong. I have to say it's a most beautiful place with all of the land, wildlife, monuments, store, a lot of things. It's a lot nicer now that I would think back then during the war. 

I had this love/hate relationship with Scarlett. I thought she was a spoiled, selfish person and the way she treated people and her own children were appalling. I loved that she was a crude business woman and just got it done. One of her slaves named Pork (who I loved) told her if she was as nice to white people as she was to black folk that the world might like her. But Scarlett didn't care, she said what she wanted and did what she wanted. 

She didn't want to take care of Melanie when the soldiers were coming. She hated Melanie because she was married to Ashley, the man she always wanted. It was off the rails with all of that with him. Scarlet jumped right on the crazy train with that one and it cost her in the end. But Scarlet stayed with Melanie when she had her baby and got her to safety at Scarlett's home Tara. She took care of everyone in the family.. say what you want.. but -SHE.DID.NOT.LET.THEM.STARVE.



--->EXCERPT<---

Hunger gnawed at her empty stomach again and she said aloud: ""As God is my witness, as God is my witness, the Yankees aren't going to lick me. I'm going to live through this, and when it's over, I'm never going to be hungry again. No, nor any of my folks. If I have to steal or kill--as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.""

Scarlett hated every moment of taking care of her family. Of worrying about others, but she did it. In a war that was senseless. 

Margaret Mitchell told everything like it is, laid it out bare for us to cringe and hate and cry. So many things were so wrong, but it was what it was...

My favorite character was Melanie. She was such a kind soul, but she had her moments when she got her backbone on and told people like it was, and they respected her because of this kindness. She was married to Ashley and I thought she was going to die in childbirth but she lived through it. It wasn't her time yet. 

I loved Scarlett's dad a lot - Gerald O'Hara. This is where Scarlett got her temper. But he was a funny man, a good man to his family and people and animals. I loved Mrs. Tarleton, Grandma Fontaine, Mammy, Uncle Peter.. there are so many I can't even name them all and like I said before some were only in the book a few times. 

Scarlett married twice and had two children. She didn't care for children and she didn't care for her husbands, she just did what she did to get what she needed. 

I had a love/hate relationship with Rhett too. Back in those days it was okay but he was a way older man taking up or trying to take up with a younger girl in Scarlett. But it wasn't just that he just got on my nerves with is comings and goings. I think if he really loved Scarlett for that long he should have told her and wooed her and then maybe things would have turned out differently. I have no idea. 



Scarlett did have a child with Rhett as well. Things were all good in the home for a while and then things went way down hill....... It was sad to read, hard to read. I wish the ending was different, but it wasn't. It was an extremely sad ending for two different reasons and I won't give those away. I know most people have probably read the book or watched the movie a million times and already know but still. I cried and cried! :-(

This is a tremendously heartbreaking book, but I'm so, so glad that I read it! 

MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"
807,Bonnie,Crime and Punishment,"Nov 16, 2008",5,"There was a time in my life when I couldn‚Äôt get enough of reading Dostoevsky. Maybe because his books made me think so deeply about being human and how we choose to live our lives. I began with Crime and Punishment, probably the work he is best known for. 

What I remember is being fascinated by Dostoevsky‚Äôs brilliant understanding of human nature. I remember thinking what a deep study this book was; an incredible examination of a man who commits murder and how he is ‚Äúpunished‚Äù for it. 

I remember thinking that here was a master storyteller. Not only able to create complex characters, but able to take the reader deeply inside a character‚Äôs mind. Best of all, I remember that I would stop reading periodically and think; not a mindless read, but an absorbing one."
808,Mischenko,Animal Farm,"Jan 07, 2018",5,"This book is featured on Shabby Sunday @ https://readrantrockandroll.com/2018/...

I read Animal Farm when I was in college and it was one of those reads where you think it‚Äôs going to be boring, but it turns out to be a favorite. It‚Äôs an allegorical tale representing the Russian Revolution where the characters in the book represent people during this time.

I won‚Äôt go into the plot too much, but in a nutshell, this story is about a group of farm animals who rise up against the evil farmer who cares for them. They basically take over the farm by cause of Old Major (Marx/Lenen), the pig all about change. He get‚Äôs all the animals together into an uprising against Mr. Jones, the farmer (Tsar Nicholas II). The animal characters then run the farm themselves and develop their own hierarchy being lead by Snowball (Trotsky) and Napoleon (Stalin). In a way, the story reminds me of an Aesop‚Äôs Fable because the animal characters in the book have human characteristics and there are morals and messages that are quite obvious. Young readers can read it and they won‚Äôt pick up on the meaning‚Äìthey‚Äôll just think it‚Äôs a story about a group of rebellious farm animals against humans, but I believe the message that Orwell wanted to express is that power corrupts. Also that people need to think for themselves, educate yourself and make your own decisions. Don‚Äôt let others think for you.

Someone recently asked me who my favorite character was in the book which is a really difficult question to ask, in my opinion. I liked a handful of the characters including Boxer, Snowball, Benjamin, and Clover, but if I had to choose a favorite, it would have to be Snowball. Snowball‚Äôs ideas were in the best interests of the animals and he was always fair. He wanted to educate the other animals and make life easier for them. He was intelligent, brave, and stood up for his beliefs which is why he‚Äôs my favorite character in the book.

I‚Äôm not sure exactly how old my edition of Animal Farm is because no publication date is given, however, Goodreads seems to have this Signet Classic published in 1956. This thin paperback is in great shape for it‚Äôs age with clean, crisp pages.

My rating on this one is 5*****"

‚ÄúSarcasm is the last refuge of the imaginatively bankrupt.‚Äù

This book didn't leave a good taste in my mouth. Basically, it left no taste in my mouth. Or if it left a taste, it was like water taste. It didn't exist. But let's talk a bit about my history with the Shadowhunter world. But first the plot in italics cause we're classy as fuck.

When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder‚Äï much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing‚Äïnot even a smear of blood‚Äïto show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?

This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know... 

This is the first Cassandra Clare book I have ever read. You would think I knew nothing of this world before and I just starting delving to it now. And you would be wrong. Many years ago the film ""City of Bones"" with Lily Collins was the shit. Everyone was watching it and I watched it too. I didn't like it. It didn't feel special to me. After that the show ""Shadowhunters"" started. I started watching it because of a dear friend who is obsessed with it. I watch more than 70 tv shows so it's hard for me to watch something that special. And that's the case here. It wasn't anything special. But I liked it a lot and I loved the characters. Then, I joined the book community about a year ago. This book was everywhere. EVERYWHERE. So, as always, I joined the hype train and bought it. And now here we are. So, even though I have never read anything related to the Shadowhunter world, I knew about it a lot. And this is important to note here, I'm not just a new fan of everything. 

Let's start with what I liked. I enjoyed the banter and the humor in this book extremely much. Especially Jace's humor, I felt myself laughing out loud at times. The only moments this character was bearable. I also enjoyed the immersive world. The author created a very unique and beautiful but also gloomy world that is rich and full and has a huge history behind it. Many details about it bored me to death üíÄ but it was exciting nonetheless. And now the juicy shit. What I didn't like.

This book felt so childish, juvenile and immature to me. Even when the plot was getting serious, I just wanted to laugh. It started off better but after the whole Simon-rat-vampires-werewolves-fucking-motorcycles-that-fucking-fly shit, it went downhill for me. I couldn't take ANYTHING that was happening seriously! I mean come on, they wasted 50 pages on the Simon-rat situation, which was ridiculous, and another 10 pages on what ride they would get to get to Clary's house! I mean come on man! 

I hated Clary's perspective. I hated her insecurity, her hatred towards Izzy was unreasonable. You don't hate on someone just because they're prettier than you. Or because you think they are. She didn't even give her a chance at the beginning. Basically, the reason I think the book seemed childish to me was that we were seeing things from Clary's POV. The writing also didn't help the case, but Clary is a very immature character. 

HOW DID THIS AUTHOR SUCCEED IN MAKING EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK UNLIKABLE??? (except Simon, SIMON ILY YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE). Characters like Izzy, Magnus and Alec, who have been my favorites for years because of the tv show, felt so distasteful to me! Imagine if I didn't know the characters from before. I would hated the guts out of them. Clary and Jace weren't a surprise to me. I didn't even like them from the show. I don't think I will ever like these two characters. They have been on my black list for years. And it's a pity because we see things from Clary's eyes. A damn pity.

To sum it all up, I didn't enjoy this book. I wanted to, I wanted to add a new favorite series to my collection but it didn't happen. My dick was hard for this book series and it fell down real fast. I'm sorry, don't hate me. I think the show has done a better job with adapting this series. I know it's not the source material and it isn't that good but I prefer it. I will continue to read this series because I have heard the writing gets better, but it won't be a priority. So many books to read, so little time. Anyway... until the next one KBYE!!!"
810,Virginia Ronan ‚ô• Herondale ‚ô•,The Lightning Thief ,"Oct 22, 2017",4,"‚ÄúThe real world is where the monsters are.‚Äù

Believe it or not, but this was actually my first Rick Riordan book!!! 

AND

I really enjoyed it!!! *lol*

This was such an epic adventure and I loved the countless hints and references to Greek Mythology! XD Rick Riordan‚Äôs approach definitely was a more than just funny one and I couldn‚Äôt help but had to laugh out loud whenever Percy opened his mouth! 
I swear that young boy is the embodiment of sass and the more I read about him, the more I got attached to this awesome boy! <3 I want to adopt Perseus and if Poseidon doesn‚Äôt want him it‚Äôs his own fault! XD 

After reading the first book I don‚Äôt really feel a connection to Annabeth, but maybe this is going to change?! She seemed to be an interesting character and I liked their easy banter, altogether she was just too reserved for my taste though, which is pretty sad because I‚Äôm more than just certain that she‚Äôs actually a very cool girl! (On a side note: I really loved that she gave Percy the nickname ‚ÄúSeaweed Brain‚Äù! *lol* I‚Äôm fairly certain it could have been worse! ;-P)

And Grover? Well, I guess I liked Grover as well! His habit to eat tin cans was a little unsettling but hey, I‚Äôm not going to judge him for his rather questionable diet. XD After all his heart is in the right place and when it comes down to it, this is everything that counts! ;-P I just hope he‚Äôll survive his personal quest and I can‚Äôt help but wonder if we‚Äôre going to see him in one of the next books! 

Since my jump on the ‚ÄúPercy Jackson‚Äù train seems to be more than just a little delayed, I finally decided to leave it at that. I guess there is really nothing I could write or say that hasn‚Äôt been said already! I mean there are actually 73.916 reviews on goodreads! (Yes, I looked it up! ;-P) So yeah, I guess that says it all! XD

If you haven‚Äôt had the pleasure to read the book yet I recommend you to do the following though:
Get a copy of ‚ÄúThe Lightning Thief‚Äù, snuggle into your soft and comfy bed, ignore the bad autumn weather and enjoy the freaky ride! ;-P"

812,J.G. Keely,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,"May 27, 2007",5,"I think that the failure not only of Children's Literature as a whole, but of our very concept of children and the child's mind is that we think it a crime to challenge and confront that mind. Children are first protected from their culture--kept remote and safe--and then they are thrust incongruously into a world that they have been told is unsafe and unsavory; and we expected them not to blanch.

It has been my policy that the best literature for children is not a trifling thing, not a simplification of the adult or a sillier take on the world. Good Children's literature is some of the most difficult literature to write because one must challenge, engage, please, and awe a mind without resorting to archetypes or life experience.

Once a body grows old enough, we are all saddened by the thought of a breakup. We have a set of knowledge and memories. The pain returns to the surface. Children are not born with these understandings, so to make them understand pain, fear, and loss is no trivial thing. The education of children is the transformation of an erratic and hedonistic little beast into a creature with a rational method by which to judge the world.

A child must be taught not to fear monsters but to fear instead electrical outlets, pink slips, poor people, and lack of social acceptance. The former is frightening in and of itself, the latter for complex, internal reasons. I think the real reason that culture often fears sexuality and violence in children is because they are such natural urges. We fear to trigger them because we cannot control the little beasts. We cannot watch them every minute.

So, to write Children's Literature, an author must create something complex and challenging, something that the child can turn over in their mind without accidentally revealing some terrible aspect of the world that the child is not yet capable of dealing with. Carroll did this by basing his fantasies off of complex, impersonal structures: linguistics and mathematical theory. These things have all the ambiguity, uncertainty, and structure of the grown-up world without the messy, human parts.

This is also why the Alice stories fulfill another requirement I have for Children's Lit: that it be just as intriguing and rewarding for adults. There is no need to limit the depth in books for children, because each reader will come away with whatever they are capable of finding. Fill an attic with treasures and the child who enters it may find any number of things--put a single coin in a room and you ensure that the child will find it, but nothing more.

Of course, we must remember that nothing we can write will ever be more strange or disturbing to a child than the pure, unadulterated world that we will always have failed to prepare them for. However, perhaps we can fail a little less and give them Alice. Not all outlets are to be feared, despite what your parents taught you. In fact, some should be prodded with regularity, and if you dare, not a little joy."

Read this one many years ago so it was time for a reread. Witty, sarcastic, and sad, enjoyed it all over again."
814,brian,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Oct 04, 2008",2,"i was a kid watching an episode of thundercats in which a few of the cats were trapped in some kind of superbubble thing and it hit me that, being cartoons, the characters could just be erased and redrawn outside the bubble or could just fly away or tunnel their way out. or teleport. or just do whatever they wanted. i mean, they were line and color in a world of line and color. now this applies to any work of fiction but it just felt different with a lowest-common-denominator cartoon. adherence to reality (reality as defined within the world of the cartoon) wasn‚Äôt a top priority. this ended my cartoon watching days. was it a lack of, or too much, imagination? dunno. 

i had a similar experience with One Hundred Years of Solitude. gypsies bring items to Macondo, a village hidden away from mass civilization by miles of swamp and mountain. these everyday items (magnets, ice, etc.) are interpreted as ‚Äòmagic‚Äô by people who have never seen them and it forces the reader to reconfigure her perception of much of what she formerly found ordinary. amazing. and then the gypsies bring a magic carpet. a real one. one that works. and there is no distinction b/t magnets and the magic carpet. this, i guess, is magical realism. and i had a Thundercats moment in that i found the magic carpet to immediately render all that preceded it as irrelevant. are ice and magnets the same as magic carpets? what is the relation between magic and science? how can i trust and believe in a character who takes such pains to understand ice and magnets and who, using the most primitive scientific means, works day and night to discover that the earth is round -- but then blindly accepts that carpets can fly? or that people can instantaneously increase their body weight sevenfold by pure will? or that human blood can twist and turn through streets to find a specific person? fuck the characters, how can i trust the writer if the world is totally undefined? if people can refuse to die (and it‚Äôs not explained who or how or why) where are the stakes? how can i care about any situation if I can't trust Garcia Marquez not to simply make the persons involved sprout wings and fly away? 

so i‚Äôm at page 200. and i‚Äôm gonna push on. but it‚Äôs tough. do i care when someone dies if death isn‚Äôt permanent? how do i give a fuk about characters who have seen death reversed but don‚Äôt freak the fuck out (which is inconsistent with what does make them freak the fuck out) and who also continue to cry when someone dies? yeah, there are some gems along the way, but i think had Solitude been structured as a large collection of interconnected short stories (kinda like a magical realism Winesberg, Ohio?) it would've worked much better. 

should the book be read as fairy-tale? myth? allegory? no, i‚Äôd label anyone a fraud who tried to explain away this 500 page book as mere allegory. i don‚Äôt believe Garcia Marquez has as fertile an imagination as Borges or Cervantes or Mutis ‚Äì- three chaps who could pull something like this off on storytelling power alone; but three chaps who, though they may dabble in this stuff, clearly define the world their characters inhabit. 

this is one of the most beloved books of all time and i‚Äôm not so arrogant (damn close) to discount the word of all these people (although I do have gothboy, DFJ, and Borges on my side--a strong argument for or against anything), and not so blind to see the joy this brings to so many people. but i don‚Äôt get it. and i aggressively recommend The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll to any and all who find Solitude to be the end all and be all."
815,Tatiana,Divergent ,"Jan 26, 2011",3,"As seen on The Readventurer

We all know why Divergent was written. There is no doubt 99% of dystopias published during the last year or so have been trying to at least partially replicate the success of the trilogy. Public wants to read more dystopian stories, publishers want to sell them, authors want to write them. Everyone is happy. 

I have read a few new dystopias recently and liked or disliked them to various degrees. There are dystopias for any taste, dystopias that emphasize separate aspects of the trilogy. There are dystopias that bank on romance (Matched or Delirium). There are dystopias that take the shock value route (Wither). And then there is Divergent that caters to the crowd who wants more action in their dystopias. And action this novel delivers!

In a few words, Divergent is a one long initiation trial. Beatrice Prior is a member of a society that has been maintaining its peaceful existence by separating its citizens into 5 distinct factions. These factions are formed on the basis of virtues they cultivate in their members - Candor values honesty the most, Abnegation - selflessness, Dauntless - bravery, Amity - peacefulness and Erudite - intelligence. At 16 all citizens take a test that is supposed to help them decide if they want to stay with the faction into which they were born or transfer to another faction forever. Beatrice's test results are inconclusive and puzzling. Ultimately she decides to abandon her own faction (Abnegation) and her family and enter another (Dauntless). But of course, the transfer is not easy. The initiation trials are grueling. Divergent is essentially a depiction of Beatrice's road to becoming a Dauntless, both physically and emotionally. Beatrice's unusual test results come to play too, and in a major way.

This emphasis on multiple trials and exercises is the strongest and the weakest part of the story. Veronica Roth has a special talent for writing great fighting scenes, pulse-raising and adrenaline-pumping scenes. Her imagination in terms of inventing different tests and challenges seems to be limitless. Something exciting happens to Beatrice every day of her trials. But that is also the weakness of the story. About 85% of the book is dedicated to action and exercises. The actual story starts only around page 415 of this 500-page book. Only then stakes are raised and real action begins. If you ask me, 400-pages is a lot of prep to finally get to the meat of the story.

Don't get me wrong, I liked the book (3 stars means ""i liked it"" on Goodreads). Divergent is good entertainment. I liked it, I was engaged in the story, I was even excited quite often. But something was missing for me. The novel has good characters, but they are not quite as interesting and compelling as they could have been; it has a lot of action, but the justification for the amount of violence involved is not quite adequate; it has a cute romance, but it never quite makes your heart contract in that sweet, painful way (you know what I am talking about, don't you?); the concept of factions is a unique one but not quite plausible; the explanation what a Divergent actually is is not quite climactic; finally, except for one plot twist (p 415), the story takes a rather predictable road.

I liked Divergent. I liked it more than Matched, Delirium or Wither. I liked it less than Blood Red Road or Ship Breaker. It entertained me. It promotes all the good things - bravery and self-sufficiency, friendships, honesty, determination. It is all about girl empowerment. But as the same time it isn't particularly thought-provoking or chilling. It never truly touched my heart. It is a write-by-numbers dystopia.

The verdict? I guess, you'll have to see for yourself?

P.S. While I am on the subject of dystopias and have your attention, I want to recommend one of my most favorite dystopias that doesn't get nearly as much acknowledgment as it deserves. Please, check out Neal Shusterman's Unwind

816,Bryn,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Jan 28, 2008",1,I agree with Michael Moorcock: racist petit-bourgeois bullshit.
817,Matthew,The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure,"Jan 08, 2013",4,"The book was good, but I think the movie is better. They are very close to each other, but I think the movie cleaned it up quite a bit."
818,Rick Riordan,Divergent ,"Nov 07, 2013",4,"I definitely enjoyed it. At first, I had trouble convincing my older son to read it, because he was convinced that every dystopian novel is a ""Hunger Games"" wannabe, but he read it on a recent plane trip and we had a great in-depth discussion about the characters and their motivations.

The premise: Chicago of the future is a closed city-state. The citizenry really doesn't have any idea what is beyond their borders. They just know it's dangerous. Inside the city, humanity is divided into five factions based on moral imperatives. Candor, for instance, values truth above all else. They serve as lawyers and public speakers. Erudite values knowledge. They serve as teachers. Abnegation values self-denial and community service. They are the community's leaders, since they alone can be trusted not to be power-hungry.

Our heroine Tris is born into Abnegation, but during her choosing ceremony at age sixteen, she decides to join the Dauntless, who value fearlessness and serve as the society's soldiers and guards. The novel follows her through her initiation training, during which Tris discovers that their society is not as harmonious as she once believed. Making things even worse, Tris must keep her true aptitude secret. She is in a small minority of people who are divergent -- whose skills could suit them for more than one faction. What this means is not at first clear, but it will make Tris's life very dangerous."
819,Zen Cho,Gone with the Wind,"Jul 03, 2011",1,"Copied over from my blog:

I'd known this was racist in a vague sort of way, not remembering much about the book or movie except bosoms and swooning, but wow, I didn't know it was that mindblowingly racist. The people who wanted to cut the n-word from Huckleberry Finn should all get together and have let's-set-Gone-With-The-Wind-on-fire parties. Man, if they applied their efforts to Gone With The Wind they could probably cut the book short by about a hundred pages.

I should say I like Scarlett as a character and found all the romance and striving bits interesting in themselves, but the book is sick through and through. It was very much worth reading. It's a bracing reminder of the wariness one should have of any nostalgia for false Arcadias.

Highlights include:
- Former slaveholders reproving Scarlett for hiring leased convicts to work on her mills. When Scarlett points out they were happy to use slave labour, they respond that their slaves weren't miserable! Narrative agrees! It's like satire, but it's not meant to be!
- In hunger and trepidation near the end of the war, Scarlett vows to herself that one day there'll be food on the table, her clothes will all be of silk, and black hands instead of white hands will pick the cotton on her plantation.
- Scarlett's lowest point is when she collapses in a slave garden and -- urgh, this part is too gross for me to even write it out. Urgh, I feel gross just remembering the line.
- Noble gentlemen whose lives have been uprooted and world turned upside down are forced in the nobility of their hearts and the staunchness of their pride to start a little club called the Ku Klux Klan. But they were forced to it! They had the best intentions!
- Ludicrous scene where Yankees are shown to be super racist against the black people they purported to want to free from slavery, whereas Southerners are good because they love their slaves and treat them like children as they should be treated.

Reading this was like being transported to an alternate universe where up was down, red was green, sweet was bitter and racist shit was not racist shit but a ~beautiful ideal~. I actually started worrying towards the end that I was going to come out of the book a more racist person.

After finishing it I felt a violent urge to read nonfiction, so I'm now reading bell hooks' Where We Stand: Class Matters and the Andayas' History of Malaysia. The stuff on alluvial deposits is particularly comforting.


One star for Scarlett and for the un-put-downable quality of the writing (it's throw-at-the-wallable, but I was never bored -- just furious). I'd give an extra star for her dynamic with Melanie which I kind of love (but what does it say when Scarlett comes off as LESS racist than Melanie because she buys into the poisonous ideals of the Confederacy less?), but I gotta do something to pull down this four star average."

 Divergent - the Walmart of Young Adult

Enjoy the selflessness of Katnis? Love the Harry Potter houses? Adore the will-they-won't-they love from Twilight?

 Well, here's the watered down combination of every YA series out there. 


There's Tris
 - the most 
annoying 
main character I've met in a while. 

The pendulum swings from - from ""oh look at me I am such an innocent little abnegation gal - I don't even look into a mirror cause I'm so selfless"" to (and this is within a couple of chapters) ""I'm the strongest girl ever, selfish to the max, got a hot boyfriend, suck it""...and back again... Constantly. 

There's character development and then there's multiple personalities.


There's Four
 - the 
super-hot
 looooooove interest.

He fulfills the roll of Slightly Creepy Older Guy Fixating on the Innocent. He's her teacher and she's completely sheltered - cue the romance. Okay, they're only 2 years apart, but that's still statutory in my state. 

Like I get it's supposed to be a steamy PG romance, but this seems borderline abuse:
""My first instinct is to push you until you break, just to see how hard I have to press,"" he says, his fingers squeezing at the word ""break."" 
This book focuses far too much on forcing the relationship and shoe-horning Tris into  the self-sacrificing hero role that there's little time for anything else...like a plot.

So, I could go on...and on...and on with my nitpicking on this series but instead, I will leave you with my favorite scene of the book.

The Shower Scene aka the  let's get Tris naked ...BECAUSE REASONS

This is the scene where Tris learns that she can't fit in her clothes cause her thigh muscles were SO BIG after training in dauntless for a couple of weeks. 

While this raises a number of concerning questions, namely - HOW did they grow in the 15 minutes it took to take a shower? and if she is such a body-shamed abnegation girl, then why in the world couldn't she just wear her old clothes back to the dorm? 

But we will disregard the obvious logic and solutions for the sake of the plot. 

Due to her thunder thighs, Tris was ""forced"" to walk back in a towel to the dorms. The tension to skyrockets with this completely unnecessary nude scene which consisted of several rape-y vibes and the complete humiliation of Tris - all to let the audience know that the Bad Guys are really Mean. 

(slow clapping in the background)

Overall, not particularly excited about reading the next one.

822,Lyn,1984,"Aug 02, 2011",5,"‚ÄúIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.‚Äù

This changed the way that I looked at ideologies and changed the way I looked at leadership. Cynical, scathing, and not without its flaws, this is still a stark, haunting glimpse at what could be. 

‚ÄúWar is peace. 
Freedom is slavery. 
Ignorance is strength.‚Äù

Chilling. 

** 2018 addendum - it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which I frequently think. The scene that I most often think is when Winston and Julia are captured.

** 2019 reread - Lost in my memory was to what extent Orwell describes and explains his nightmare. 
Winston Smith cautiously and surreptitiously learns about the Brotherhood led by Goldstein and then learns all too well about doublethink.

More than just a cautionary political tale, Orwell has described an ideological abyss into which we must not gaze; a glimpse at authoritarianism power plays to which the Nazis and Soviets never descended. While we can appreciate the reminder to avoid authoritarianism and his prophetic vision, the idea that truth can be arranged through media is perhaps the most relevant for us today. 

*** 2020 reread

This time around I focused on the human side of this iconic novel ‚Äì especially the relationship between Winston and Julia. In the past I have somewhat overlooked Julia as a character and thought that Orwell had neglected to form a strong female character, however I now think that she is every bit as strong as Winston and plays a central role in Orwell‚Äôs message. 

Whereas Winston hates the party and wants to overturn it, Julia is much more practical and realistic in her rebellion. Winston thinks about the nature of the totalitarianism in abstract ways, Julia uses the terms of doublethink against the party and makes her frank sexuality a systematic rejection of party principle.

While Orwell was forming a cautionary tale based upon his own experience in writing against authoritarian regimes like Stalin‚Äôs, Hitler‚Äôs (both actually named in the text) and by extension Moa, Mussolini and Franco, it occurs to me that the irony of Winston‚Äôs dystopia is at least to some degree focused on the party members themselves. Winston embodies the use of media as propaganda and to disseminate inaccurate statements that prop up the party. In today‚Äôs world we are already seeing this kind of abrogation of truth in favor of party purity.

Every bit as timeless and relevant as it has ever been. 

*** 2023 reread - 

I think we all have had a situation similar to this: we search on the internet for something and then we start seeing advertisements related to our earlier search. That seems reasonable enough, understandable at least.

What about this situation though: we have a VERBAL discussion with our spouse, alone in our kitchen, and then we start seeing advertisements about the subject of our speech. 

Wait a minute. OK, I‚Äôve got an Amazon echo, they must have heard us talking.

Wait a minute: heard us talking? In the ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù of our home? And who is they?

The fear of surveillance has risen to an alarming level in the past few years and we can look back to 1948 and Orwell‚Äôs tale as one source of this anxiety.

I‚Äôm in my early 50s as I write this and my generation was raised to be somewhat suspect of governmental intrusions and overreach, taught to be vigilant against totalitarianism. We lived in the time of the Soviet Union and we were taught to be mindful of surveillance and propaganda.

But what if the surveillance does not come from government? 
What if what we were taught was itself not wholly correct or accurate?

A young person recently told me that they had read 1984 in high school in the past 3-4 years so this gave me some hope about the next generation.

As a press officer in the military, I had a hand, as did Winston Smith, in shaping the news and thus history. If in my little corner of history, I cropped photos, erasing some people‚Äôs involvement in an event, destroying the full accurate record of what happened, then extrapolate this ability at official omission and you can begin to see how easily can the truth be tweaked to match a desired narrative.

This book is as provocative as ever, maybe more so in our strange political climate. More than anything else, this is a thought provoking novel, we are required to think critically about what Orwell states and he invites us, page after page, to think and rethink what we know and how we have been led to know it.

If we ‚Äúknow‚Äù something is true, why do we know that? HOW do we know that truth? Like Faulkner‚Äôs Absalom! Absalom! We are asked to consider our source and to be at least a little skeptical, of everything.

In this reread, I also made notice of the casual violence that creeps up into Winston‚Äôs thoughts. Was Orwell suggesting that the subrogation of Winston‚Äôs natural feelings caused an aggressive response in him? Does injustice and tyranny lead to subconscious of animosity?

Orwell describes how Proles represent 85% of Oceania, we see the propaganda and party policy from the perspective of the party, of a party member who actually initiates the remaking of news and thus history. The Party makes up 15% and the inner party is only about 2%. It occurred to me that I‚Äôm a Prole, most of us are on the outside looking in. Like George Carlin said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a club, and we‚Äôre not in it.‚Äù Did the Proles care anymore? Did they pay attention to the ‚Äúnews‚Äù or were they more like Julia, and only played the part for the surveillance state?

I‚Äôm going to buy copies of this book for the young people in my life."

WARNING: If you enjoyed this book, even a little bit, you may not want to read this review. It will probably make you angry. Heaven knows that the book made me furious, and I intend to turn every bit of that wrath back on it.
Instead, I suggest you read karen's review, Brigid's review, Joyzi's review, or any other of the gushing four and five-star reviews here. If video reviews are more your style, I suggest Melina Pendulum's vlog about this book.
Realistically, I know a lot of you are not going to listen, which is why the edit is here. At least it will slow you down a little.



EDIT: adding one more thing because, despite the warning and the redirect links I kindly provided, I have indeed gotten the kind of sexist bullshit comments I anticipated. Before you launch into the usual defense, therefore, I give you this:

""Alternatively, some fans may find it tempting to argue ‚ÄúWell this media is a realistic portrayal of societies like X, Y, Z‚Äù. But when you say that sexism and racism and heterosexism and cissexism have to be in the narrative or the story won‚Äôt be realistic, what you are saying is that we humans literally cannot recognise ourselves without systemic prejudice, nor can we connect to characters who are not unrepentant bigots. Um, yikes. YIKES, you guys.
And even if you think that‚Äôs true (which scares the hell out of me), I don‚Äôt see you arguing for an accurate portrayal of everything in your fiction all the time. For example, most people seem fine without accurate portrayal of what personal hygiene was really like in 1300 CE in their medieval fantasy media. (Newsflash: realistically, Robb Stark and Jon Snow rarely bathed or brushed their teeth or hair). In real life, people have to go to the bathroom. In movies and books, they don‚Äôt show that very much, because it‚Äôs boring and gross. Well, guess what: bigotry is also boring and gross. But everyone is just dying to keep that in the script.""

Here's the scoop on this review. For a book that I hate, I usually write a lot. After suffering for several hundred pages, I have pleeeenty of things to say. I've never hated a book that was quite as long as this one quite as much as I do, so I've had to alter my review so that I can say everything I want to without going over the character limit.
The first part is an unorganized rant. I marked pages with particularly annoying quotes on them; for these rants, I broke the book into segments of 100 pages and wrote up quotes and responses for each segment into separate blog posts. These are all linked below.
The second part will be a more organized rant masquerading as a review. MAKE NO MISTAKE: THIS IS A 'HATER' REVIEW. IF ANYTHING WAS GOING TO CAUSE ME TO SPONTANEOUSLY DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO BREATHE FIRE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS BOOK.

Part 2:
There are books I don't like.
There are books I loathe.

And then...
there's this book, which did its level best to drive me to drinking.

and I don't even like alcohol.



I wanted to like this. I wanted it to be as excellent as so many people insist it is. There are some books that I went into expecting them to be horrible, but this isn't one of them. Oh, my hopes were high here - it was recommended by a plethora of great authors, including the guys of Writing Excuses, who I absolutely love. Reviewers who I greatly respect rated it four and five stars and wrote at length about how awesome it was. Other people praised the book as ""the greatest achievement of the fantasy genre so far"" and Martin as ""the greatest fantasy writer of all time"".

It's those last two that are most important, I think, because I love the fantasy genre - always have, and hopefully always will. Fantasy is what got me into reading (well, Harry Potter, specifically) and it's been one of my mainstays for as long as I can remember. I bought this book in large part because it was so often touted as, if not always the greatest achievement of the genre, one of the major works of fantasy published in our time. Having recently read several works by Brandon Sanderson, all of which were innovative, highly readable, and deeply philosophical, I was excited to see what Martin (by all reports an even better writer than Sanderson) could do. I expected my mind to be blown, repeatedly, and to be faced with the challenge of writing a review for a book so staggeringly brilliant that I could hardly think straight after finishing it.

That is far, far, far from what I got.

First of all, this book is definitely not what I think of when I hear the word 'fantasy'. It's certainly far from my definition of 'high fantasy'. Now, I realize that my definition of 'high fantasy', which includes pervasive magic, unusual creatures, and a setting that is vividly far from the real world, is not the definition you'll find if you look the term up online. I also don't care. Seeing as the critical definition appears to characterize high fantasy solely by the fact that it doesn't take place on our Earth, and as this definition is written as if high fantasy and sword-and-sorcery are mutually exclusive, I'm inclined to conclude that whoever wrote said definition is pretty damn stupid and carry on with my own outlines of what makes fantasy high, low, urban, epic, or any other subcategory or combination thereof.
That said - this book? High fantasy? Not as far as I'm concerned. It is, to say the least, distinctly lacking in the requisite elements of the fantastic.

Is it possible that Martin is going for a 'the magic comes back' subplot over the course of the series? Definitely. Do I give two shits about the rest of the series? NOPE.
This book comes off as a pathetic attempt at fantasy by someone who doesn't really care about the genre, or doesn't know much about it. It mostly struck me more as an alternate universe War of the Roses fanfiction, with some hints of magic thrown in in a halfassed attempt to give it a place on the genre fiction shelves of bookstores. You can explain to me over and over how Martin intended to make his world 'gritty' and 'realistic' and I will tell you over and over that that shouldn't matter: that it is possible to have a fantasy which is gritty, realistic, and also utterly fantastical. It's even possible to do it without losing the particular areas where Martin seemed to be trying for gritty realism: since he chose to make all of his characters of the nobility anyhow, he wouldn't have had to worry about overglorifying the lives of the peasantry, as one might with a more economically diverse cast.
Now, I'm willing to give Martin the benefit of the doubt a little bit on the possibility of the 'magic comes back' thing, because there did seem to be elements here that could become fantastical if fully explained later. The problem, of course, is that they're tossed out without background, let alone proper explanation, and so feel jarring and out of place - not a coherent part of the world, but bits tossed in to be linked together later. Right now... all they managed to do was trip me up, throw me ass-over-teakettle out of the story, and leave me blinking at the page in confusion and not a little bit of frustration.
(And yeah, maybe part of why I'm so sore about this is that, like I said, I started this book not long after reading some Sanderson, and Sanderson is basically the king of seamless, fantastical, elegant worldbuilding, so pretty much anyone looks bad in comparison, but still.)
If I had to assign this book to a genre, I'd call it 'low fantasy', because as far as I'm concerned it was running too low on the qualities that make fantasy what it is. It's about as much fantasy as fanfiction that translates characters to the modern day is - namely, basically mundane with a miniscule twist.

The characters of this book also stand out... and not in a good way.

There are a lot of them - eight POVs and plenty more on the side - and not a single one of them is likeable. They all had the potential to be, which makes it worse. Bran, the Stark boy who learns too much and is crippled as a result, could have an interesting arc if it weren't so slow and drawn-out. The hints of genuine pathos-inducing story are definitely there. They're also present in the chapters focused on Catelyn, who is the closest Martin gets to a truly nuanced character. Ned Stark, Catelyn's husband, is supposed to be the noble one - too bad his 'nobility' comes off as stupidity instead. Jon Snow, Ned's bastard child, is a truly stereotypical fantasy character: the super special 'outcast' who is nonetheless generally loved except by those the narration makes a point to show as bigoted and cruel, who never really has to work either for physical skills or personal growth, and who gets gifted by the narrative with an absurd number of SUPER UNIQUE TRAPPINGS, including an albino wolf (really, Martin, REALLY? Are you secretly a fourteen year-old girl writing horrendous anime fanfic or something? Answer: no, and the comparison is insulting to fourteen year-old girls.) and a bastard sword that was a family heirloom of a noble house not his own. Arya is by far the most entertaining of the Starks, but only because she fulfills all sorts of rebellious-noble-girl-learns-to-fight tropes that I'm quite fond of. Sansa's chapters made me set the book down for days on end; she is beyond a shadow of a doubt the most insipid, annoying, airheaded character I have ever read and she has not a single whisper of a redeeming quality. Tyrion Lannister is what Jon Snow could have become without the heapings of Gary Stu in his youth: a bitter middle-aged man with father issues who turns to sex and crudity as his only defense; somewhat akin to Catelyn, he had the potential to be interesting and nuanced if his behavior hadn't been played dead straight.

And there's one more: Daenerys Targaryen. Oh, Dany, Dany, Dany. I could write a dissertation on Dany and everything that went wrong with her story - but I don't have that kind of time.
For those of you not familiar with this most epic of George R.R. Martin's characterization and plot failures, here is a summary:
(oh and spoilers, but I honestly can't be bothered to tag it.)
When we first meet her, Dany is thirteen years ond and about to be sold (effectively) into marriage with Khal Drogo, a warlord of the Dothraki people, by her abusive and not-a-little-bit-crazy brother, Viserys. Viserys has convinced himself that Drogo will help him take back 'his' kingdom - this being the Seven Kingdoms where the rest of the book takes place - hence the whole 'selling his sister to be raped by married to someone he obviously sees as a barbarian' thing. The marriage occurs, and then the wedding night in truly squicky half-detail. There then follows a long journey across the plains to a Dothraki city, during which Dany is raped (and no, I will not call it anything else) by Drogo. By her fourteenth birthday she is pregnant. When they arrive in the Dothraki city, Viserys makes such an ass of himself that Drogo kills him by pouring molten gold over his head in the middle of a feasting hall. Robert, the current king of the Seven Kingdoms who the Targaryens see as a usurper, sends assassins to kill Dany - naturally, they fail - and Drogo gets so angry at this that he decides to commit all his people to attacking the Seven Kingdoms in retribution. They leave the Dothraki city (at this point Dany is heavily pregnant) and go out to wreak havoc across the countryside on their way to conquest. In one such battle Drogo is wounded; because he refuses to care for the wound properly, it gets infected. When it is clear that he is going to die, Dany appeals to an old woman to perform forbidden magic to save him; the rest of Drogo's people do not approve and try to cast Dany out. End result: Dany loses her child to create a Drogo-zombie, which she then smothers. When his body is placed on the traditional pyre, she adds in three supposedly dead dragon eggs (given to her as wedding gifts and which any fool could see hundreds of pages off were bound to hatch) and, surprise surprise, they hatch.

To which my primary objections are:
1. The blinding obviousness of the ending
2. The fact that this single plotline - this single POV among eight - is so far distant from and so barely related to the others

3. The fact that Dany being raped is never treated as what it is, and that the relationship between her and Drogo is portrayed as love.



The first two are self-explanatory; the third, of course, is the big thorny problem. Now, I can sort of understand the perspective which argues that Dany is taking control of her sexuality - she comes to enjoy sex and even to initiate and control it at times. However, SHE IS AT NO POINT OLDER THAN FOURTEEN. There's a reason that such a concept as an 'age of consent' exists - there is an age at which teenagers are genuinely immature and probably shouldn't be making life-changing decisions like, say, things that could get them pregnant. Now, I understand that in the medieval times like those that this book is based on, girls were getting married and having children a lot earlier, and that people in general were more mature at an early age. However, Dany shows none of that maturity until after she's been with Drogo for weeks - if not months. When she's married to him, she is if anything unusually innocent for her age. It's a little hard for me to accept the idea that she's taking control of her sexuality when she's so young and clueless that her first sexual experience is a choice only inasmuch as she chooses not to fight back. Not fighting back, by the way, doesn't mean it's not rape, particularly in the situation that Dany is in (vastly younger than Drogo, vastly weaker, browbeaten by her abusive brother and told over and over that her obligation is to do whatever her husband wants). Nor are her later sexual experiences ones of choice; in fact, it is explicitly stated that even when she had horrible saddle sores and could barely walk, she was expected to be available for sex and treated as such. If anything, her eventual enjoyment of it seems more like a psychological block put up as a survival tactic than genuine pleasure in the act or love for Drogo.
Yet, despite the fact that this situation is obviously, beyond a shadow of a doubt, rape, it's never addressed in-text. If anything, it's portrayed as a positive experience for Dany, one that makes her stronger and enables her to stand up for herself. 

Stupid me; I thought that the cancerous expansion of rape-as-love was limited to abusive jackass love interests in YA paranormal romances; clearly, I was wrong. It's everywhere, people. We are all completely fucking doomed.

Which brings me to one of the other major frustrations I had with this book: the sex. 
Ummm... what to say? I thought reading some of the V'lane bits of Darkfever while sitting next to my mother on the plane was uncomfortable; to my utter shock, that was nothing compared to reading the sex scenes of this book alone. No worry about someone looking over my shoulder and reading about MacKayla Lane getting hot and bothered - and yet even more awkward. Why? Well, as one reviewer put it (and I wish I could remember who to give them credit), they're written kind of as if they're these tremendous mythic events. I cringe at the very thought of quoting them, but to give you a little idea of what they're like... (worst romance sex scenes you've ever read) - (bizarre flowerly euphemisms) + (gratuitous use of the word 'manhood')*(general strange reverence for penises above and beyond the norm) + (incidences of incest) = Game of Thrones sex scene.
In general: AWKWARD.

(Just to be sure you feel my pain.)


This book felt male-oriented in a way that is so painfully forced that it made me distinctly uncomfortable. I don't mean that women can't enjoy it - obviously, as all the reviews I linked back at the top demonstrate, they can and they do. I mean that the book itself felt as if it were written for the most stereotypical male audience imaginable. As Tatiana described it, it reads like a soap opera for men. Because MEN want lots of violence, sex, swearing by female genitalia, and paper-thin motivations, right? Which is exactly what Martin dishes up.

and so is the book he's produced.


I thought at around the halfway point that I'd finish the book and be able to watch the HBO show to get the rest of the series without suffering through more awkwardly described sex scenes (not to mention the rest of it). By the time I finished, though, I had developed such a virulent hatred for this book, its author, and everything related to either of the above that I start grinding my teeth just reading praise for it. Watching the show would be vastly to my detriment - mostly because neither my hand nor my bank account would do well after I put my fist through the screen of my laptop.

In conclusion/summary:






Oh, and to the diehard defenders of this series, like those who were plaguing Keely's review, who like to tell people who disagree with them that GRRM is the greatest writer of ALL TIME and that the female characters presented herein are feminist (or, to use an exact quote, that ""GRRM has written some of the most independent, self-reliant heroines ever to grace the fantasy genre. It's more than half the reason he's so beloved. His female characters disdain male attention, are always smarter, faster, deadlier, and braver than any of their male counterparts. Kinda like feminists with swords"" which is complete and utter bullshit), I have only one thing to say:




THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT."
824,Ruchita,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Oct 01, 2011",1,"[I have a new website where I review awesome books & more! http://unlearner.com]

I wanted to like Ender's Game. I really did. It's a wonder that even after more than halfway into the book, I still clung on to the foolishly optimistic notion that the book would somehow redeem itself. That it would end up justifying the tedious, repetitive, drearily dull chapters I trundled through over the course of several days (which is unusual, since I'm generally a fast reader).

It pains me to say it, as a hardcore fangirl of science fiction, that one of sci-fi's most beloved and highly regarded novels did not do it for me. Actually, that is understating it. While I'm at it, I'll just duck and blurt it out: I loathed Ender's Game. 

Deep breaths. Let that sink in. Let the hate flow through you. Good, strike me down...I am unarmed. 

Okay. Now let's get to it.

Was it because the expectations I had in my mind were unreasonably high and thus were responsible for ruining the book for me? No way. I make no bones about the fact that Ender's Game, regardless of the respect and popularity it commands in sci-fi circles, is an inherently bad novel. 

Why, though, you might ask. Why such vitriol for the book? Here you are, then. 

1) Bad plotting: It didn't take me long to realise that after I was past Ender's arrival at the Battle School, every - literally every chapter thereon until his return to Earth - was more or less the same thing. Battle games, beating the shit out of kids, battle games, switching back and forth to Armies, battle games. It was so repetitive that I was exhausted at the end of every.single.chapter. Page after page after page of six year old, seven year old, eight year old Ender and his buddies zooming about in ships trying to freeze one another's socks off. Wheeee!

2) Lack of characterisation: There are no personalities. There are no motivations. You never learn anything about the characters except that they are the good guys or the bad guys. Ender is brilliant at everything. He NEVER loses. Not once. Bernard, Stilson and Co. are the bad guys. They're evil baddies cause dey r jealuz of ender's brilliance omg!!! That's it. No background, no depth, no internal conflicts. No motivation. Words cannot express how two-dimensional and woefully lacking in personality the characters are.

3) Demosthenes and Locke. What the heck was that all about? I appreciate Card's prescience about the 'Nets' and blogging before it was around, but come on, this is pushing it a bit too far. How, I beg you, how are we supposed to take the idea that a pair of kids end up taking the world by posting in online forums and blogging? 

As if we people of the internet didn't have enough delusions of grandeur already. ;)

4) Now, this really gets my goat:I had to wait for the last 20 pages to get information that was of any worth to the story at all. I'm talking about Mazer's Rackham explaning (view spoiler)[the buggger's communications system (hide spoiler)] to Ender. As for the 'twist ending': I honestly, and I mean, honestly did not find that riveting. It was predictable and, worse, did not justify all that I had to read to make my way to the end. 

 5)Also: It was hard to feel for Ender. I say this as a high-school nerd in my own day, as the reviled and hated and made-fun-of socially awkward kid who wanted to be good at whatever they did. But that doesn't make me any more sympathetic to Ender. Honestly, I fail to see what's so great about Ender anyway. I am so infuriated at Card for this. Apart from Ender's claim to intelligence (which is never completely explained, by the way) there is nothing, NOTHING, that is worth justifying him as the protagonist of one of scifi's supposedly best books ever. Yes, he loves his sister Valentine. Yes, he doesn't want to hurt people. Yes, he goes ahead and does it anyway. Again and again. (view spoiler)[(Ending up murdering two school boys in the process. Uhm, major wtf there.) (hide spoiler)]

I am rarely so caustic about the books I read, but this time I feel I am justified in doing so. I had such hopes for this book. Not impossibly high or anything. At the very least, I had expected to like it, you know? I remember, as I worked my way past chapters 4,5,7,10,14...I expected it to get better. I expected myself to be mistaken at the initial dissatisfaction, then incredulity, then mild annoyance and then a string of sad sighs and resignation to dislike. Alas, I wasn't mistaken. I felt betrayed. I thought this book was right up there with those 'kindred ones', you know? The sort of books you can come back to again and again. Instead, what I got was a bad plotline, progressively unrealistic plot developments, and a cast of flat, lifeless, unpleasant characters to boot. Ender's Game, how I wish I had loved you. Why did you forsake me thus."
825,Meghhnaa  (On a Review-Writing Break!),The Princess Bride,"Nov 14, 2022",4,"To help recuperate the sick child (Author William Goldman), the old father reads out the story of ‚ÄúThe Princess Bride‚Äù by S. Morgenstern to him. Years later, obsessed with the book, determined to procure a copy of it, extensively rummaging through bookshops, William Goldman finally ends up finding an ancient copy of it.
He eventually realizes that his father read out only the ‚Äúgood parts of the story‚Äù, and resorts to opting for the fictional route of writing the abridged story of ‚ÄúThe Princess Bride‚Äù. 
 
Well going through the extended introduction was wee tedious and boring for me, so I skimmed through it. 
I was assiduously seeking to whet my appetite for fantasy by seizing the main adventure story of Buttercup and not the story of the rhyme and reason for abridgment by the author.
 
Additionally, the author kept barging with his POV throughout the story, giving a feel of a book within a book, which kept distracting me from my dreamland sporadically, which I didn‚Äôt hold in high regard. So, docked 1.5 stars!
 
The main plot summary of the adventure story (without spoilers)-
Not considering herself as one of the most beautiful females, Buttercup, is sluggish to comb her hair and isn‚Äôt concerned about her image. This comes across as her most salient feature as she is not proud and haughty about her beauty like most of the other females. In short, she wears the image of a tomboy. No matter what Buttercup commands the Farm Boy, Westley, to do, he simply answers, ""As you wish."" Buttercup develops feelings for him and eventually, both are in love in no time. Both are extremely simple, and the love that bridges the two is based on the purest of intentions and not on money or beauty! 
Westley leaves on a quest to seek better fortune, while promising Buttercup of his return to marry her.
Buttercup swears to be faithful but is devastated to learn that Wesley's ship has been attacked by the infamous Dread Pirate Roberts, who presumes him dead. After 5 years, she agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck even though she still loves Wesley. Prince Humperdinck is the inverse of Buttercup and Westley. He is arrogant and narcissistic.  Concerned with appearances, Buttercup is just a mere possession for him!
Before the wedding, Buttercup is kidnaped by three bandits- a Sicilian boss named Vizzini, a giant named Fezzik, and a Spanish swordsman named Inigo who is seeking to avenge his father's murder, what follows ahead is a fast-paced thrilling adventure. Read it for yourself and explore!  üòä
 
I agree with William‚Äôs father's decision to close the book on a ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù, by offering a conclusive rest to the readers after traversing through an action-packed adventure!
 
The story professes the power of love that is pure, honest and true, untouched with malice and is unadulterated. 
 
Despite many years apart, Buttercup and Westley remain connected through the bonds of love. Even death cannot separate those who experience true love! 
 
I would have given 5-stars to this adventure laden taut fairy-tale story but docked 1.5 stars due to the intermittent sporadic appearance of the parallel pragmatic story by Willian Goldman and his POV, which muted my fantasy-reading experience.
The characters are well-fleshed out and are bound to stay with the readers for a long time! An adventure and action-packed 3.5 stars drizzled to this wonderful story inundated with the power of true love and innocence, which starts with ‚Äúas you wish‚Äù and closes with ‚Äúso do I‚Äù üòä
 
 
NB-I haven‚Äôt watched the movie adaptation of ‚ÄúThe Princess Bride‚Äù and have only read the book, so not aware of the differences in the execution of the plot-line!
 
The exposition of the theme of the trials and tribulations of true love came as a welcome lull for me. 
Buttercup and Westley proved that love is not idealized, but is lasting. Buttercup never ceases to love Westley even while fearing him dead and even though she bickers with him after finding out he is alive. Westley stays loyal to Buttercup throughout! Their love for each other was overtly-cute!"
826,Suhailah,The Outsiders,"Nov 10, 2023",5,"‚ÄúStay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold . . .‚Äù

The Outsiders is a coming-of-age classic that explores the topics of loss, tragedy, social division, wealth inequality, injustice, and lack of opportunities. I was completely shocked to learn that the author was only 16 years old when the story was written. A story with such deep topics young people are usually oblivious to. Therefore, I highly recommend reading the author‚Äôs note. 

I watched the 80s film adaptation of The Outsiders many years ago, and it has always been very memorable. It has an amazing cast! Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to have seen the movie prior to reading the book because then you picture the actors as the characters as you read. Which is exactly what I experienced while reading! 

I actually never knew it was based on a book until I joined Goodreads a few years ago. I finally got around to reading it this year. It was a quick read, very hard to put down, and really squeezed some major emotions out of me. I think to truly be able to relate to and understand the depths of the inner pain this book depicts, you have to have been an outsider at one point or another in your lifetime. And I most definitely have been on many occasions. 

‚ÄúI stared at the ceiling. What would it be like, I wondered, staring at a different ceiling? What would it be like in a different bed, in a different room?‚Äù ~ Ponyboy 

This quote really struck me‚Ä¶.
What would it really be like for everyone to have equal opportunities and lives that others take for granted? Such as a safe home? A loving family? Money? How would the world be different? 

So above all, this story is really a story about the injustices of inequality; the fate our society has created and continues to nurture every single day. But it‚Äôs a phenomenal story and a phenomenal movie. Highly recommend it! But expect to really feel something when you read it. 

I‚Äôll always hold a special place in my heart for Ponyboy, Johnny, Sodapop, Darry, and Dallas‚Ä¶.

I also loved the book references to Gone With the Wind and Pip from Great Expectations!"
827,Peter Meredith,Pride and Prejudice,"Oct 24, 2011",2,"18 chapters in... I want that to sink in for a moment... ok. 18 chapters in and NOTHING has happened. I am enjoying her writing style very much, but I also enjoy the back of an occasional cereal box so that may not mean much. We will see.
I am sitting here eating a tootsie roll, a Halloween left over, and I can't help notice the similarities between it and the novel Pride and Prejudice. First off, like P and P, the tootsie roll wasn't one of those dinky ones that you can almost swallow in a single bite so you know that I've been at this for a while and now that I finally got it down, I have to wonder why I put it into mouth to begin with. Secondly, tootsie rolls are a throwback to another age, there are far better candies out there and the 36 wrappers littering the floor will attest to this. You have to really like tootsie rolls to appreciate them. I don't.
Pride and Prejudice is the dullest most wonderfully written book that I have ever read. I read it simply to get a feel for the author's fantastic ability at arranging words, and really I mean it when I say, oh what wonderful blather.
I give the book one star. 
After 62 chapters, there is nothing that happens. There is barely a story to the story, at least not one that could be remotely interesting...even to people who like romance. In the age of bodices, there is nary a one that is ripped open, let alone one that is undone with the gentle exploring fingers of a lover. 
And then there is the hubbub over the book...Satirical? A witty comedy of manners? Sure, I smiled a few times at the only funny character in the book, Mr. Bennett, but overall, I read, studied the sentence structure, noticed the wall paper and waited patiently as the paint dried. Even the dramatic ending where Lizzy gets the guy, is a letdown and dull. Just to let you know, I was joking about it being in any way dramatic. Which brings me to the characters. Other than Lizzy, they are all stereotypical and lack even the most remote concept of depth. Jane is pretty and sweet from the first page to the last. The mom is overbearing, the dad aloof. Other than Darcy, no one grows or changes in a book that spans a few years and endless pages.
Normally, I use one star for books that I just can't finish and if I wasn't an aspiring author, I wouldn't have bothered to get through half the book, but since I did... and when I compare it to yawner like A Tale of Two Cities, I had to bump this one up a notch.
PS, Don't read Moby Dick either, if you know what's good for you."
828,Mark Lawrence,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Nov 06, 2010",3,"Publishers have my sympathy. If I try to put myself in the place of an editor picking this manuscript from the pile I can say with some certainty that I would not have recognized it as the ticket to a multi-billion dollar prize. I would have thought to myself that it was a good fun read, revisiting the magic-school trope and doing a fine job for children in the 8 to 12 range. If I hadn't had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number of publishers, I might have passed in favour of a book I liked better.

I read this maybe 15 years back so I could share in what was exciting my three kids at the time. And I've read it twice to my daughter, Celyn. We read the first 5 some years back, and now she's 12 we're going to read the whole lot. She's very disabled and can't read for herself (she can't hold the book or see the page for starters...) 

Having just finished I've checked the shelves to discover we have two copies of book 1 and two copies of book 3, but none of book 2. So JKR will be getting some more of my money shortly!

To the review... I liked the book. I have no idea why it has sold a gazzilion copies more than any other children's book or why so many adults are so taken with it. JKR writes solid enough prose, though her addiction to adverbs in dialogue tags irks me no end, he said testily. She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child. Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences? If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn't been left to give the solution to the potion test ... or the key hadn't been left in the same room as the door that wouldn't yield to magic ... would that not have been a better way to defend the treasure? Yes ... it was more fun this way, but ... dammit ... kids aren't stupid...

But yes, funny and inventive magic, school dynamics of making friends and enemies, the hijinx, the evil baddie, the chosen one... it's all good. Celyn certainly enjoyed it. She's on team Hermionie.

The only other thing that really bothered me was the repeated insinuation, present even in the term itself, that 'muggles' are somehow lesser. That the random gift of magical ability somehow makes you better.

I remember that later on (and hinted at in this book) the idea of mud-bloods (wizards born of muggles) is offered up as a proxy for racism and we're invited to condemn Draco Malfoy for his views (rightly so). But all the time I read this I'm feeling the hypocrisy embodied in the whole idea of muggles, which, albeit voiced without open malice, is really the same damn thing. 

I will report back on book 2 when we're done.

EDITED IN FROM THE COMMENTS:

>>Aliyah wrote: ""Personally I believe the trope is so familiar to you because of JK Rowling. She made this style of fantasy more popular.""

>My reply: Personal beliefs are fine and dandy, but in this instance ... badly wrong.

My first encounter with magic schools was in The Worst Witch series (1974) which centres on a magic school and which I began in 1974. Followed by A Wizard of Earthsea (1968) which also centres on a magic school and which I read in 1975.

The mechanics of reaching a boarding school on a dedicated train laid on for the purpose and of sorting a boarding school into four groups to be housed in four towers was something I encountered at a still younger age in the early 70s in my mother's copy of First Term at Malory Towers (1946).

829,Arlene,Divergent ,"Mar 31, 2011",5,"This book is totally WICKED!! I am, without a doubt, hooked. I want more‚Ä¶ NOW!

Divergent by Veronica Roth is one of the more highly anticipated YA dystopic novels set to come out next month, so I‚Äôm very fortunate for my Street Corner Booker friend for sharing this great read with me on our ARC tour. Thank you Alexa! 

I have to say, I had an absolute blast reading this wild ride of an adventure, and I enjoyed every minute of it. EVERY.SINGLE.MINUTE! I haven‚Äôt had this sort of rush since Katniss entered the Hunger Games and turned my world right side out! The characters, setting, plot, pace and narrative where perfectly blended to produce a highly action packed novel that I‚Äôm sure will captivate dystopia fans. I‚Äôve found a series that will keep me eager for the coming releases, and I can‚Äôt wait to read more of Tris and her crew of Divergents!

The story takes place in an undermined future where the world is divided into factions, including Candor (honest), Abnegation (selflessness), Dauntless (daring), Erudite (knowledgeable), and Amity (peaceful). Tris, our main character, has reached the age of sixteen where she is tested and placed in a faction that complements her intuition and character. As the story progresses and she chooses her path, it‚Äôs suddenly clear that she doesn‚Äôt quite fit in just one faction and that proves threatening for those controlling this perfect society because as a Divergent, she can‚Äôt easily be manipulated. What comes next is a continuous reveal of hidden agendas and power plays. 

I loved to see how Tris evolved in the story. In the beginning, we get hints of her courage and intuition, and as she goes through her initiations her badassness explodes! There‚Äôs nothing I love more than female characters that can kick some serious ass! She was awesome. 

Now I have to say, number Four took a while to grow on me, but eventually it happened. I like his tactile nature‚Ä¶ one moment while I wipe the steam off of my glasses‚Ä¶ :P I will have to say the reveal surrounding his name was a little underwhelming (view spoiler)[as we learn his real name is Tobias and the reason they call him Four is because there are only four fear factors in his character (hide spoiler)] but there was so much to this character that just took off after the second half and I found myself anticipating his scenes. Loved Four!

The final quarter of the book goes into high gear and the adrenaline rush is loaded with high octane power. This book did it right and I just can‚Äôt wait for the next release. This is one series that will find itself on my top shelf. LOVED.IT!

Thank you Alexa! <3 Nic, you're next! =]

830,Emily May,Lord of the Flies,"Dec 05, 2010",4,"Kids are evil. Don't you know?

I've just finished rereading this book for my book club but, to be honest, I've liked it ever since my class were made to read it in high school. Overall, Lord of the Flies doesn't seem to be very popular, but I've always liked the almost Hobbesian look at the state of nature and how humanity behaves when left alone without societal rules and structures. Make the characters all angel-faced kids with sadistic sides to their personality and what do you have? Just your average high school drama, but set on a desert island. With a bit more bloody murder. But not that much more.

In 1954, when this book was published, Britain was in the process of being forced to face some harsh realities that it had blissfully chosen to ignore beforehand - that it is not, in fact, the centre of the universe, and the British Empire was not a thing of national pride, but an embarrassing infringement on the freedom and rights of other human beings. Much of British colonialism had been justified as a self-righteous mission to educate and modernise foreign ""savages"". So when put into its historical context, alongside the decolonisation movements, this book could be said to be an interesting deconstruction of white, Western supremacy. 

Of course, to a modern reader there's a lot of racism in this book. The racial aspect is a big factor. Golding establishes from the very first page that Ralph is a perfect white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, private school boy. And Piggy even asks ""Which is better - to be a pack of painted n*****s like you are or to be sensible like Ralph is?"" I'm not going to argue with anyone's interpretation, but I think there is actually room to see this book as a criticism of racism. For me, I always saw it as Golding challenging the notion of savages being dark-skinned, uneducated people from rural areas. With this book, he says screw that, I'll show you savages! and proceeds to show us how these private school silver spoon little jewels of the empire are no better for their fancy education and gold-plated upbringing.

I think that seemed especially clear from the ending when the officer says 
""I should have thought that a pack of British boys - you're all British, aren't you? - would have been able to put up a better show than that.""
 Golding's way of saying that human nature is universal and no one can escape it.

Some readers say that you have to have quite a negative view of human nature already to appreciate this book, but I don't think that's true. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with all the implications running around in the novel - namely, the failure of democracy and the pro-authority stance - but it serves as an interesting look at the dark side of human nature and how no one is beyond its reach. Plus, anyone who had a bit of a rough time in high school will probably not find the events in this book a huge leap of the imagination. 

The fascinating thing about Lord of the Flies is the way many historical parallels can be drawn from the messages it carries. You could choose to view the charismatic and manipulative Jack Merridew as a kind of Hitler (or other dictator) who takes advantage of a group of people at their weakest. Dictators and radicals often find it easy to slip in when a society is in chaos... we do not have to assume that Golding believed that everyone everywhere is evil, only that we all have the capacity for it when we find ourselves in unstable situations.

Still a fascinating book after all these years.

831,Emily May,A Game of Thrones ,"May 20, 2019",4,"""When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.""

3 1/2 stars. So in one weekend I finally finished the book I picked up and put down about ten years ago, and watched the final episode of the TV series I have loved for eight years. How odd that the book ended up better than I expected, and the TV show, um... didn't. Warning: I will be talking about the depiction of rape in this review.

I think I was more ready to commit this time around. I'd already watched the show and become invested in the characters, so reading 900 pages about them didn't seem so unattractive. I think it's quite well-written, especially the dialogue, which is where Martin shines. It's also just entertaining for the most part. The bloody vicious backstabbing kind of entertainment that, apparently, I do like.

It's also an amazing feat of world building. I was blown away by the amount of thought and detail that has gone into this-- and it's just the first book. Martin has considered details that would never have even crossed my mind - little sayings, folktales and quirks particular to the people of certain regions or certain houses - but it all serves to make a very rich and complex world that is all the more believable for it. He has created a whole new universe from scratch, one with thousands of years of history, and many different peoples and cultures. It's breathtaking, honestly.

Unfortunately, it's not all good. Saying nothing of the show's finale, there are many strong and smart women in this series with fantastic story arcs, and yet the book (and show) cannot shake some of its misogyny. Tatiana covered this well. 13-year-old Dany's ""romance"" with her rapist is one of the lowest points.

On this read of A Game of Thrones I found the exact moment I put it down the first time around. I got further than I remembered. It was that moment during Dany and Drogo's wedding when a woman is raped. It wasn't the rape in itself. Though of course I find rape deeply disturbing, I also know that it has been a horrible but true reality in many wars and societies. Showing that it happens does not seem unrealistic. What I found truly awful about this one scene, though, was the way the woman was barely described as a person. We don't know what her name was, what she looked like, what her reaction was, or what her fate was. This woman being raped was so throwaway, with the focus of the scene being the Dothraki who were raping her and fighting over her.

The only thing that kept me reading this time was knowing that there are so many amazing female characters in this series who are treated with empathy and - for the most part - respect by the author. I am just hoping that Martin finishes these bloody books so we can get a better ending than the show *fingers crossed*

Oh, and I 100% agree with the show writers decision to up the ages of major characters like Robb, Jon and Dany. It seemed like a very odd decision to have 13-15 year olds leading wars and revolutions.

This would be a good series if you're a fan of gory historical fiction. You know the kind with bloody battles, political upheaval, and despicable people? It's like that, but with dragons. Don't read this if you are sensitive to scenes of graphic violence, rape and/or incest.

833,Michael,Crime and Punishment,"Apr 24, 2017",5,"Here's another review as I go! I suppose I just can't let go of Dostoyevsky's squalid, bleak, complicated, and spiritually vexing world, so despite having just finished The Brothers Karamazov, I find myself plunging headlong into Crime and Punishment, a book I last read 20 years ago.

I'm reading the new Oliver Ready translation, and it's wonderful so far.

I can well imagine how shocking this book must have been at the time. It depicts a world where everyone is either taking advantage of someone else or being taken advantage of, where most of the characters are engaged in a mean, petty, and morally bankrupt struggle for survival. Ironically, it's Raskolnikov himself who comes closest to espousing some idealistic notion of virtue among all the squalor, when he criticizes his sister for being engaged to someone she doesn't love, all for the sake of the man's money, with its potential to lift their family out of poverty.

***

Dostoyevsky is brilliant at depicting a character on the edge--one whose thoughts veer between lucidity and paranoia and whose passions overwhelm him even when he can hardly muster the energy to get off his sofa. What's interesting about his passion is the deep moralism that accompanies it--his sense of the world's injustice, as when he rushes to save Marmeladov, a drunkard who was trampled by a horse, and brings the man to his family and feels sorry for them all as he comforts them and gives them money. You get the sense here of a man who deeply feels all the depravity and injustice of the world, one who can hardly stand it, and yet he's the murderer and perhaps the most depraved one of all. 

And yet.... Raskolnikov is also quite suspicious of ""phonies,"" to use a Holden Caulfield term, as when he confronts his sister's fiance. Here's another complication in this fascinating character. Is he the most ""honest"" character in the book? In a way he is, but of course he's hiding the biggest secret. He constantly struggles against his own duplicity and is often on the verge of blurting out his crime. He even does at one point, yet his listener thinks it's a joke, and he plays along, but you can see how the act of dissimulation itself is so painful to him.

***

When Raskolnikov visits the disgraced Sonya, he becomes strangely Christ-like, kissing her feet and claiming he's bowing ""to all human suffering."" He seems to take all suffering on his shoulders, especially the suffering of children, as he constantly warns Sonya about what will happen to her young siblings should their mother die. But of course this is all complicated by Raskolnikov's avowed athiesm, which he makes clear to Sonya when she says that God would never let their mother die and leave those young children as defenseless and homeless orphans, and Raskolnikov responds, ""almost with a sort of malicious glee,"" by asking: ""What if there is no God?""

***

There is certainly no romanticizing of poverty here, as we see Katerina Ivanovna literally go mad and die from her circumstances. What a tragic and pathetic scene when, homeless, she drags her young children to the streetcorner, dresses them up like performers, and demands they sing and dance for coins, all the while they're crying and she's yelling and coughing up blood. Raskolnikov's premonitions come true, when he turns to Sonya afterwards and wonders what will happen to the children now.

***

Raskolnikov, for all his powers of empathy, seems to long for something more--for the power to achieve greatness, to become a great figure of history--and the murder is for him bound up in this quest. He rationalizes that if Napoleon, in order to fulfill his destiny, had to knock off a few lowly people, wouldn't he be justified in doing so? Passages like this presage all sorts of 20th century horrors, and it's fascinating to see them here, spoken by this most complicated character.

***

Hurtling toward the end now, with Raskolnikov having confessed to a distraught Sonya, and Svidrigailov overhearing from the room next door. Svidrigailov tries to use his knowledge to confront Raskolnikov's sister and get her in his power, claiming he'll take Raskolnikov away with him to America to save him, if only Avdotya will succumb to him. In a scene straight out of a pulp novel, she's shocked and pulls out a revolver and shoots at him as he approaches her, only to graze his head. But he realizes she will never love him, and even after she throws the revolver aside, he allows her to escape.

***

Some spoilers may follow, but I'll do my best not to give too much away:

The fate of Svidrigailov was for me the one false note in the book--the one point where Dostoyevsky took the easy way out. I wasn't at all convinced he'd use the revolver in the way he did, and I felt the author basically wanted this troublesome character out of the way.

Otherwise, wow, the ending was just brilliant--the drama of whether Raskolnikov would confess or not was drawn out masterfully. Then, in Siberia, we get what were for me some of the saddest and truest lines of the entire book:

""Existence alone had never been enough for him; he'd always wanted more. And perhaps the only reason he'd considered himself a man to whom more was permitted than to others was the very strength of his desires.""

Only at the end, after a sickness, and Sonya's sickness, does Raskolnikov finally shed the torments of his ambition toward greatness--which in many ways was the driver of his entire crime. He becomes, finally, content, because he finally finds love--real deep spiritual love for this woman who'd given up everything to live near his remote penal colony. Love is what finally transforms him and gives him hope that, after seven more years, he'll be able at last to live.

And so ends this amazing journey--one that will remain with me for a long time, one that I'll ponder and dip back into, one that seems so modern and relevant today. In a way it really does presage the entire 20th century, with its exposition of how dreams of greatness can lead to sordid crimes, how greatness is a form of torment and perhaps even a form of demented thinking. I can't help seeing Raskolnikov as a ""wanna-be"" Stalin, or Hitler, or Mao, or any of those tragically self-aggrandizing men who see crime as simply a means to an end, who believe they're superior beings and are therefore entitled to use ""lesser"" people to service their own dreams. It's a terrifying mentality, and Dostoyevsky knew it well. If only we'd listened to him....."

835,Jennifer ~ TarHeelReader,Charlotte's Web,"Apr 25, 2015",5,"I have been listening to or reading Charlotte's Web since 1983. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Bunting, read this magical book to our class, and I can vividly remember sitting on my carpet square, entranced. Her reading that book to our class was the highlight of each day. Later that year, there was a movie in the theaters, and we went to see it as a class field trip. From my memory, everyone in class was excited about the book and the movie. This was book was that important in the lives of early readers. 

I also remember the book fair that school year, and my mom allowed me to buy one book (and bookmark- these were the days of unicorns and rainbows, and my first bookmark had both. ü¶Ñ üåà ). I'm sure you can guess what my purchase was. My copy of Charlotte's Web was read more times than I could ever possibly keep track, and as some of my book friends know, even at age 6, I worked hard to keep that well-loved book in pristine condition. üòâ We still have my copy somewhere, and I'm on a mission to find it. 

All of that to say, when Audible had a sale recently on the audio read by E.B. White in the 1970s, I quickly bought it. You know an audio is good when you are instantly ready to listen to it again. There is nothing better than the author of THE perfect book reading his own perfect words. So much love and connection in his voice, tone, and inflection. Some books are full of magic that lives in your heart forever, and Charlotte's Web is certainly in mine.

836,Majenta,The Help,"Jan 12, 2016",5,"""I know what a froat is and how to fix it."" 

Aibileen Clark knows how to cure childhood illnesses and how to help a young aspiring writer write a regular household-hints column for the local paper. But she's struggling mightily to deal with grief over the death of her 20-something son, and she SURE doesn't think conditions will ever improve for African-American domestic-engineering servants in early-1960s Jackson, Mississippi or anywhere else in the South. 

Aibileen's good friend Minny has been a maid since she was very young, and on the first day of her first job her mother admonished her that sass-mouth, especially her degree of it, is highly dangerous--but it's not long before she's just gotta mouth off....and look for another job. As Minny's first ""episode"" of the book opens, she is yet again looking for a new job, and this time an opportunity pretty much falls into her lap. Celia Foote needs a domestic engineer, but she also needs a friend, a real ally, even a confidante. Oh, one more thing: she needs to keep Minny a secret, at least for a while. I think this plotline was my favorite part. Celia's husband had formerly gone with (even been engaged to?) somebody else; did any of you wonder how they would have gotten along if he had married her instead of Celia?

But, really, which is the worse attack from Minny: a good sass-mouthin' or a good slice of her extra-special chocolate revenge pie?

Thanks for reading."
837,Vit Babenco,Lord of the Flies,"Oct 25, 2020",5,"Lord of the Flies is a parable of the human nature‚Ä¶
His mind was crowded with memories; memories of the knowledge that had come to them when they closed in on the struggling pig, knowledge that they had outwitted a living thing, imposed their will upon it, taken away its life like a long satisfying drink.
Ever since primordial times man is ruled by two opposite forces: a wish to create and a wish to destroy‚Ä¶ And to destroy is much easier than to create‚Ä¶
There was the brilliant world of hunting, tactics, fierce exhilaration, skill; and there was the world of longing and baffled commonsense.
And since primordial times man is ruled by fear‚Ä¶ And the greatest fear is the fear of the unknown‚Ä¶ To make the unknown less cruel and dangerous man tries to placate it offering the unknown sacrifices and worshiping‚Ä¶
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll kill a pig and give a feast.‚Äù He paused and went on more slowly. ‚ÄúAnd about the beast. When we kill we‚Äôll leave some of the kill for it. Then it won‚Äôt bother us, maybe.‚Äù
Millenniums pass but the primordial instincts remain and they make man look for an enemy and fight."
838,Nataliya,To Kill a Mockingbird,"May 02, 2010",5,"Life gives you a few things that you can count on. Death (for all), taxes (for most), and the unwavering moral character of Atticus Finch (for me). ""What would Atticus do?"" is not just a meme; for eleven-year-old me it became a real consideration after I feigned an illness to cut school and stay home to finish To Kill a Mockingbird ‚Äî while a decidedly non-Atticus-like move, choosing Harper Lee's book over sixth grade math was probably a wiser life choice.For my thoughts on the shameless money grab by the money-greedy publishers recently published first draft of the novel inexplicably (or read: cash grab) marketed as a sequel... Well, I think I just said it all.I cannot be objective about this book - I don't think you can ever be about the things you love. I've read it many times as a child and a few times as an adult, and it never lost that special something that captivated me as a kid of Jem Finch's age.






‚Äú[...] Before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.‚Äù
To me, this book is as close to perfect as one can get.

It found a place in school curriculum because of its message, undoubtedly - but it's not what makes it so powerful. After all, if you have even a speck of brains you will understand that racism is wrong and you should treat people right and that ‚ÄúYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.‚Äù 

No, what makes it wonderful is the perfect narrative voice combining adult perspective while maintaining a child's voice, through which we glimpse both the grown-up woman looking back through the lessons of years while still seeing the unmistakable innocence and incorruptible feistiness of young Scout Finch. And then there is the magic of the slow measured narration painting the most vivid picture of the sleepy Southern town where there's enough darkness lurking inside the people's souls to be picked up even by very young, albeit quite perceptive children.
""If there's just one kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I'm beginning to understand something. I think I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this time. It's because he wants to stay inside.‚Äù
And then there's Atticus Finch. Yes, there may be countless articles all fueled by Lee's first draft about his 'transformation' into a bigot - but I refuse to jump on that bandwagon. I stand behind him the way Lee developed him in the book she *did* publish. Because I sleep better knowing that there are people out there who are good and principled and kind and compassionate, who will do everything they can with the utmost patience to teach their children to be decent human beings. 
‚ÄúI wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.""
What shines in this book the most for me is the amazing relationship between parent and child. It's the amazing guidance that the Finch children get in becoming good human beings that many of us would give up a lot for. I know I would. Because to me it will never be a story of a white man saving the world (and some, especially with the publication of that ridiculous first draft, would dismiss it as such). To me, it's the story of a child growing up and learning to see the world with the best possible guidance. It's a story of learning to understand and respect kindness and forgiveness and that sometimes you do right things not just because you're told to but because they are right things to do.



I see enough stupidity and nonsense and injustice in this world. And after all of it, what I often do need is Atticus Finch and reassurance that things can be right, and that with the few exceptions, even if I struggle to see it, ""[...] there's just one kind of folks. Folks."" and that, disillusioned as we become as we go on in life, ""Most people are [nice], Scout, when you finally see them.‚Äù

Five stars from both child and adult me."
839,Tharindu Dissanayake,Anne of Green Gables,"Jul 05, 2020",5,"""OH, Marilla""

""Fancy. It‚Äôs always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I never expected I would, though. Dreams don‚Äôt often come true, do they?""

""It‚Äôs been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will.""

Anne of Green Gables will always have a very special place in my memory, for it offered one of the loveliest, most wonderful stories I've ever read. This is something you could keep on reading for ever without tiring or loosing interest. I loved every chapter, every paragraph, every line, and down to the every little bit of it.

‚ÄúOh, Marilla, can I go right now‚Äîwithout washing my dishes? I‚Äôll wash them when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.‚Äù

Instead of narrating a perfect word with perfect occurring, this book offers a very much realistic existence, where the reader is met with all kinds of emotion. One could hardly conceal laughing in certain parts just as it is hardly possible to hold a tear in another part. 

""Which would you rather be if you had the choice‚Äîdivinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?""

Personally, I would've love if the book contained more narration on Anne's first two years, and move on to the next years from next book, though I guess it's coming from my own selfish need to have a better ending with Matthew. But on the other hand, I guess that inevitable reality of life adds to how the books is imprinted even deeply in one's mind and memory. In any case, the book forever remain one of my all time favorites. 

""Diana, wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore?""

‚ÄúMarilla, isn‚Äôt it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Matthew, isn‚Äôt it a wonderful morning?"""
840,Lisa of Troy,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Jan 14, 2022",5,"These Are The Stories Before We Had SmartPhones

Many years ago, I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone when it was first published in the US, before the movie, before all of the fame and merchandising opportunities. Initially, when I read it, I devoured it in two days. Now that I am old, well as old as Megan Fox, I wanted to hate on the author but couldn't.

JK Rowling makes writing look easy. Her prose is easy to read out loud, very smooth. Although the world that she has created is magical, it isn't confusing or that difficult to imagine unlike LOTR or Dune. The book is also incredibly fast paced. Many of the fantasy books that I have read have at least 100 pages to warm up. So how does the author make us want to root or cheer for Harry? How do we become invested in him? He is an orphan and an abused orphan at that. On the one hand, this formula definitely works, but isn't it a little over done? JK Rowling also sets up some beautiful scenes like when Harry is receiving his invitation to Hogwarts. How many people actually try that hard? When Ron and Harry discover that Hermione is in danger, they both go to assist her. However, most people these days would go, ""Oh well."" Sorry my INFJ is showing.

There were a few things that I didn't like:
*Why does JK Rowling hate cats? Mr Dursley sees something odd, a cat reading a map. My cats play chess, play the piano, watch TV, and once even typed ""hi"" on my computer. I don't find reading a map to be a bit strange at all. Maybe my house is just brimming with magic and as a muggle I just don't know about it? Mrs. Figg also made Harry look at photographs of all of the cats that she has ever owned. As if that is some sort of punishment!
*How Hermione is treated. When Ron and Harry are in trouble, Ron screams at her, ""Have you gone mad? Are you a witch or not?"" Um Ron, if you treat me like, you can save yourself. At the end of the book, Hermione is never fully rewarded for her portion in saving Ron and Harry, just figuring out the riddle. Even after she was a better person than I.
*Quidditch and chess - not really my thing although this opened up a brilliant line of merchandising for the author.
*Some things didn't make sense to me. Why was there a sip of the potions left? Why exactly was Dudley so popular at school? 

Now, I think a trip to Orlando is in order to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter!

842,Andrea,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Dec 21, 2007",0,"I'm only adding this book because it annoys me that it popped up on the ""most popular reads."" People, this book is terrible. Do yourself a favor and pretend you'd never heard of it. 

My short answer is that it's just no good, the long version is in the following list, which I call ""The Problems I Have With The Time-Traveler's Wife.""

1. The author is indecisive. Rather than accepting that this is a science-fiction novel, she tries to write a social commentary, romance, and art and music novel all rolled into one. 

There is so much name-dropping that it's distracting‚Äîclassical music, entomology, poetry, romance languages, library science, the American punk scene, constructivist painters, you get the idea‚Äîthey're all continually cropping up at the most inane times. What should give us a better understanding of the characters actually paints them as shells of people, identified only by superficialities. There is one completely pointless mention of a Moholy-Nagy poster that really annoyed me. I had five years of design school and while I know who Laszlo Moholy-Nagy is and how to correctly pronounce his name, I couldn't pick one of his paintings out of a lineup of his contemporaries, so I didn't even buy that this dude who has spent half of his life in limbo was some kind of expert.

2. The title character's entire life and family are so difficult to relate to that I immediately hated her. She grew up in a house that has books written about it (irritating architecture reference) and everyone must ""dress"" for dinner at her parents' house, as if this were a Bront√´ novel.

3. Her family employ five black servants. In a Christmas scene, for which the servants are unchained from the stove and allowed into the dining room, the cook actually toasts to ""Miz Abshire.""

This book was written in 2004! How can the ""Mammy"" have any place here? She isn't even the only racially stereotyped character in this book. The traveler's childhood downstairs neighbor, a grandmotherly woman he refers to as Kimmy, speaks in a broken English which could have been stolen directly from a hateful gold rush-era cartoon.

4. The book skips back and forth between the point-of-view of the title character and the time-traveler himself, but there is absolutely no difference in their voices. I think I actually got confused a few times about who was speaking. 

5. The phrase, ‚Äúshe was pale under her makeup‚Äù was used three times.

6. The chapters dealing with infertility were completely unoriginal, boring, and emotionally flat.

7. Not only are conversations unnecessarily long, but they are often followed by page after page of internal dialogue as the characters rehash and analyze every point of said conversation.

Sorry this was so long, but this might be the worst book I've ever read and I'm really confused by all the good reviews."
843,Nilufer Ozmekik,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Apr 30, 2022",5,"When I heard that HBO finally adapted this amazing book into limited series, I couldn‚Äôt get more excited! The trailer was also promising! Casting choices are not marvelous but I still hold my hopes high! 

 This masterpiece may be one of my favorite reads I never get bored to reread over and over! It‚Äôs marvelous sci-if, intriguing action packed mystery and of course tear jerker, extremely emotional love story!

 Henry DeTamble, a librarian from Chicago has a genetic disorder force him move back and forth in time since he was five. He has an artist wife Clare has known him since she was six. She does everything to adapt in this strange condition of the man she loves! 

But things get escalated at each chapter: Henry vanished into thin air without his control, finding himself jumped into another timeline, naked, vulnerable. But he has to learn how to survive in different time zones without money, proper ID, appropriate story. That‚Äôs why he sharpens his pickpocketing, lock-picking and combat skills to fight against the threats.

 Could Dr. Kendrick,famous geneticist help him to find a solution about his disorder or could he use it for his own benefit?

 Highly recommended, well written, fast pacing, mind blowing! Just read it before watch the adaptation!"
844,Miriam,Les Mis√©rables ,"Aug 08, 2007",5,"This is without question one of the most beautifully written novels I've ever read. Jean Valjean is quite possibly the most complex and compelling character you will meet in a work of literature of this magnitude, and the lives and personalities of the secondary characters are interwoven into subplots that make it almost an easy thing to get through the 1400+ pages of this book. I read the novel after seeing -- and falling madly in love with -- the musical, and this is one of the rare cases in which familiarity with one helped me to appreciate the other more; naturally the musical had to cut out and/or alter significant portions of the novel's plot in order to fit a reasonable time frame, but even as I read the novel and discovered all the things that were left out of the musical, my respect for the artistic choices made for the latter were increased tenfold. Of course the characters were portrayed in significantly richer detail in the novel, Fantine and Marius in particular. The adult Cosette, however, is singularly droll in both the book and the musical, paling in comparison to the character of Eponine in both; Hugo seeks to set Cosette up as the perfect angelic virgin, and in doing so, he makes her both unrealistic and mind-numbingly boring -- this is my only complaint about the book, other than the ways in which Hugo sometimes deals with women in general, though you have to consider that he was, to some extent, a product of the times.

Hugo does shoot himself in the foot in one way; his plots are so absorbing that I found myself temporarily skipping over chapters-worth of exquisite prose to find out what happened next, as Hugo had a nasty little habit of setting up wonderfully tense scenes full of suspense and intrigue, only to present you with something like the history of the French sewer system on the next page. But his descriptions are every bit as rich and wonderful as his action plots; my favorite line from the novel is, ""Every bird that flies has a shred of the infinite in its claw,"" which can be found in the middle of a breathtaking paragraph praising the complexities of the natural world, but I cannot for the life of me remember what that was supposed to relate to in terms of the actual storyline of the book.

This book is not to be missed. But if you have too short an attention span, then at the very least, see the musical, on Broadway or better if you can. There is, after all, a very good reason why they call it the greatest musical of all time."
845,Savannah,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Aug 15, 2007",4,"Madeleine L'Engle is a Christian writer, more so even than C. S. Lewis in my opinion. However, while the influence of Christian Theology (and in later books, biblical history) is woven throughly through out all the books in this series, it is not offensive to non-Christian readers. I am one of those. 

To be completely honest, when my mother first read me this when I was about 7 years old, I was totally oblivious to the influence L'Engle's faith has on her writing. It wasn't until I was twelve or thirteen, when I read the entire series several times over, that it became obvious to me. 

But I digress. What really makes this book (and others in the series) has nothing directly to do with the writer's faith. It has to do with the different types of non-sexual love found between family, friends, society, and the individual. I know, big thing for a Children's novel, but it generally is shown rather then told thereby allowing young children to learn by example.

Going back to the faith thing for half a second, it's like a large parable for how the New Testament (Protestant Christian, any how) advises people to form relationships and maintain them. We are to love and respect our parents, even when the world doesn't. Meg believes in and loves her father, even though he has some odd theories and has been missing for years. We are to care after our siblings regardless of personal quibbles, again like Meg and her brothers. WE are to show compassion for our neighbors despite what other members of our society think (See Calvin's friendship with Meg and Charles) and To care for them even though it might mean personal risk, as in some of the later scenes. Over all, it demonstrates a non-sexual love as one of the most powerful forces in the Universe. And this is a moral lesson that every faith can embrace."
846,Sarah,The Fault in Our Stars,"May 21, 2014",0,"What can I say about this amazing book that has not already been said a million times? It's real, heart-wrenching and so, so well written. I'm a fan of alll of John's books but this one is a masterpiece. I'm not even exaggerating."
847,Laura,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Jun 11, 2008",1,"More like A Hundred Years of Torture. I read this partly in a misguided attempt to expand my literary horizons and partly because my uncle was a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Then again, he also used to re-read Ulysses for fun, which just goes to show that you should never take book advice from someone whose IQ is more than 30 points higher than your own.

I have patience for a lot of excesses, like verbiage and chocolate, but not for 5000 pages featuring three generations of people with the same names. I finally tore out the family tree at the beginning of the book and used it as a bookmark! To be fair, the book isn‚Äôt actually 5000 pages, but also to be fair, the endlessly interwoven stories of bizarre exploits and fantastical phenomena make it seem like it is. The whole time I read it I thought, ‚ÄúThis must be what it‚Äôs like to be stoned.‚Äù Well, actually most of the time I was just trying to keep the characters straight. The rest of the time I was wondering if I was the victim of odorless paint fumes. However, I think I was simply the victim of Marquez‚Äôs brand of magical realism, which I can take in short stories but find a bit much to swallow in a long novel. Again, to be fair, this novel is lauded and loved by many, and I can sort of see why. A shimmering panoramic of a village‚Äôs history would appeal to those who enjoy tragicomedy laced heavily with fantasy. It‚Äôs just way too heavily laced for me."
848,Meg Sherman,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Jan 12, 2009",5,"I guarantee that 95% of you will hate this book, and at least 70% of you will hate it enough to not finish it, but I loved it. Guess I was just in the mood for it. Here's how it breaks down:

AMAZING THINGS: I can literally feel new wrinkles spreading across the surface of my brain when I read this guy. He's so wicked smart that there's no chance he's completely sane. His adjectives and descriptions are 100% PERFECT, and yet entirely nonsensical. After reading three chapters, it starts making sense... and that's when you realize you're probably crazy, too. And you are. We all are.

The magical realism style of the book is DELICIOUS. Sure, it's an epic tragedy following a long line of familial insanity, but that doesn't stop the people from eating dirt, coming back from the dead, spreading a plague of contagious insomnia, or enjoying a nice thunderstorm of yellow flowers. It's all presented in such a natural light that you think, ""Of course. Of course he grows aquatic plants in his false teeth. Now why wouldn't he?""

This guy is the epitome of unique. Give me a single sentence, ANY SENTENCE the man has ever written, and I will recognize it. Nobody writes like him. (Also, his sentences average about 1,438 words each, so pretty much it's either him or Faulkner)

REASONS WHY MOST OF YOU WILL HATE THIS BOOK: I have to engage every ounce of my mental ability just to understand what the *@ is going on! Most people who read for relaxation and entertainment will want to send Marquez hate mail. 

Also, there are approximately 20 main characters and about 4 names that they all share. I realize that's probably realistic in Hispanic cultures of the era, but SERIOUSLY, by the time you get to the sixth character named Aureliano, you'll have to draw yourself a diagram. Not even the classic Russians suffer from as much name-confusion as this guy.

On an uber-disturbing note, Marquez has once again (as he did in Love in the Time of Cholera) written a grown man having sex with a girl as young as 9... which is pretty much #1 on my list of ""Things That Make You Go EWW!!!"" He makes Lolita look like Polyanna on the virtue chart! (Note to authors: You give ONE of your characters a unique, but disgusting characteristic and it's good writing. Give it to more than one, and we start thinking we're reading your psychological profile, ya creep!)

If you feel like pushing your brain to its max, read it. The man did win the Nobel after all, it's amazing. But get ready to work harder to understand something than you ever have before in your life. And may God be with you.

850,John Wiswell,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Aug 13, 2007",1,"This is a novel that blows past conventional ideas like ""disbelief."" Apparently humanity, a species whose only real claim to fame is war, now stinks at war, and can only be saved by a child genius who is one part prophecy, one part bad science, and one part wish-fulfillment. Thanks to this plan, we are treated to a gaggle of super-intelligent children who seldom appear particularly clever (in fact many behave with adult maturity rather than abnormal intellect) and achieve greatness not through any great effort that we follow (rather you'll read recaps of their successful efforts), but because the author wants them to achieve these things. In this, the definitive edition of Ender's Game, there is almost nothing earned within the plot.

It's a decent story, but for a book with so many events there is very little consequence or risk, and the character development is so linear and stale. That last quality is particularly cloying considering that, prodigies or not, most of the characters are children and at least one of them should develop in an unexpected way. Instead the unexpected developments we get are humorlessly absurd, like two prodigies fooling the world with a fake op-ed column that earns them political power. The ending is predictable and deliberately anti-climactic, robbing the novel of its one true punch. The trade-off is, instead of getting the thing the book was building to, you get the opportunity for sequels and spin-offs. If you liked the infallible, mostly emotionless and paper-thin protagonist, then that's a good thing. If you were hoping to have the hours you put into the book validated with some real emotion at the end, well, neither this author's definitive edition nor any other is going to help you."
851,emma,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jan 31, 2022",1,"Life has approximately four perfect things in it.

One of them is Cake With Fresh Strawberries. 

Another of them is Running Errands And Getting Yourself A Little Treat.

The third one is Going To A Body Of Water On A Hot Day And Swimming Until You're Very Tired And Then Air-Drying In The Sun.

And the fourth one is Time Travel Romance.

The two best rom-coms on earth (and I have seen many of them, in a misguided attempt to cure myself of emotionlessness) are About Time and Safety Not Guaranteed.

Both are quirky, funny romantic comedies with lovable main characters that kind of ignores the science of time travel in order to focus on a love story. And they are perfect movies.

So, by the same logic, I should have liked this book. AT LEAST liked. If the world was fair and just and rational, I would have loved it and given it five stars and tattooed the manuscript in a full-back tattoo to rival Ben Affleck's.

But this book was not:
- funny
- quirky
- romantic
- compelling
- populated by lovable characters.

It was:
- the kind of sad that feels like a trick
- centered around the worst romance I have ever read
- bizarrely outdated considering it's literally from the 2000s

I spend my entire life on this website and am addicted to my reading challenge, but when I was finished this book I was so overwhelmed by relief / plans to gather all copies I could find in one place in order to heckle them that I didn't mark it as read for days.

It was just that bad.

In case you are one of the few people who has had the fortune of never even hearing about this book, we follow Clare (a normal girl, if pretentiousness and perfect hair and weird art qualify as ""normal"") and Henry (a time traveler, de facto sex addict, and all around asshole).

The first halfish of this book follows Henry's time travels to Clare when she is...a child. At this point, Henry knows Clare (he is married to adult her), but Clare doesn't know Henry (she is MERE MONTHS OUT OF TODDLERDOM). 

This section includes such fun as a little girl seeing a grown man naked, and a teenage girl who tries (successfully, eventually) to seduce a nearly 40 year old man because she has been groomed by him for her entire memorable life.

It's so funny when you consider that the author could have just...not done this. She opted into this kind of moral disturbance.

The second half(ish) occurs when a young(ish) (but still significantly older than Clare) Henry meets Clare for the first time. He doesn't know who she is, but she is like YOU'RE MY HUSBAND. And then they have to date.

In other words, the first half of this romance is Henry being in love with Clare when Clare is not in love with Henry and then the second vice versa. 

In other other words, these people never CHOOSE EACH OTHER!!! It's grooming and then whatever the equivalent of grooming is for grownups!

It's gross and worst of all, it's boring.

And it doesn't get better. There is supposed to be some sort of ""honeymoon period"" here, which is kind of nonexistent if you like the falling in love part of romance (aka, romance itself) or are not into pedophilia (we're in the wrong place, folks), but very quickly Clare is very unhappy because Henry is never there and Henry is very unhappy because Clare is mean when he is, and he is generally more pleased with life when he is forcibly committing sex acts with Clare before she hits the age of consent. (I am not making this up. I'm barely even being dramatic.)

But then (view spoiler)[Henry dies (hide spoiler)].

Sad stories are like a trick to me at the best of times - all art that is intended to make you feel a certain way is fundamentally emotional manipulation, and more power to em but when it doesn't work it's just awkward.

This one is even sillier because these people aren't happy enough or interesting enough for their lives to be ruined, or for that ruination to inspire any sort of feeling in me. Beyond 

This is the story of a woman who builds her entire life around a man who is by definition barely there, and then once he isn't there at all she continues to live a shell of an existence. In spite of (view spoiler)[his last wish being that she change that bullsh*t. (hide spoiler)]

If Clare ever lived a full life for herself, following passions or doing anything interesting at all, I might have had more complicated feelings about this. But instead she lives for more than forty years still waiting for Henry, (view spoiler)[which turns out to be one encounter when she is full on elderly, (hide spoiler)] so I can just hate it.

At least my feelings can be straightforward. That's the one upside.

This does have the kind of beautiful overwrought writing that I can get behind even as I know it's silly, but also I can't stress enough that you will not understand how different 2003 is from current day until you immerse yourself in the way we talked and treated each other in 2003.

I'm saying ""we"" like I wasn't 6 at the time, but still.

This was an all around nightmare.

Bottom line: So grateful I was 6 then. Books are so much better now.

852,Gavin Hetherington,The Secret Garden,"May 21, 2021",2,"Check out my 'reading middle grade for a magical week off' reading vlog where I talk about The Secret Garden: https://youtu.be/qDV2nQ5me58

I think it's very important to address and talk about the racism and ableism in 'The Secret Garden', mainly because I went into reading this totally unaware of the problematic nature of this book. I also feel like parents might also be unaware as I have been left comments on my reading vlog of this saying they had no idea, and will talk about those elements of the book with their children so they know how wrong the racism and ableism is in the book.

I'm also not here to be a gatekeeper. You can still read the book and enjoy it, I will not judge you for it. I just think that giving this book to an impressionable child could be harmful if the subject matter is not discussed with the child, because the author made no attempt to right the wrongs of the racism by the end of the book. I know it's because this book is 'a product of its time' and 'that behaviour was acceptable back then'. Well, guess what. The behaviour is not acceptable now. 

Mary begins the book as a neglected child who treats her servants in India appallingly. She even goes so far as to slap and abuse her servants. Nobody in the book bats an eye when Brown people are called ""not people"", and it's not even just Mary who has these racist views. You may argue that Mary undergoes a transformation by the end of the book and becomes a better person, and that she does. She learns compassion and kindness and is inspired to change. But does the racism ever get addressed? Does the author tell the reader that being racist is wrong? No. Mary becomes a better person without addressing how truly awful she was at the beginning of the book. 

Colin is also bed-bound and uses a wheelchair, and then suddenly, he can walk. He throws his disability away. I've seen people argue that he was never disabled, but I've also heard a lot of people with disabilities identified with Colin throughout the book until he was ""cured"" of his disability. If it had been made clear from the beginning that Colin could walk, then I don't think there'd be much of a problem. However, to bait readers with a disabled character who is miraculously cured is just another blow. Not all disabled people can be cured, and to give this idea that you can only be happy if you don't have a disability, well, that's extremely harmful to young people reading this book who are disabled. 

While themes of the book regarding change and growth is done beautifully through the tending of the garden, and how it ties in with nature, I still couldn't fully enjoy this book. I just had no idea about the racism and ableism, and I feel like a lot of people who go into this book might not know about it too. Again, I think it's okay to read it if you want, but please bare in mind that when you give this book to a child, it has these elements and open up a discussion with them about it.

Let's not act like racism and ableism is okay in this book just because it's 'a product of its time'. You know, there are hundreds of children's books published today that are better. Much, much better."
853,Manny,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Jan 18, 2018",4,"""But why me?"" asked Madeleine. ""Do I have to do it?""

""You must,"" said Mrs Whatsit. ""Your world is in grave danger. Very, very grave danger. You have to warn them.""

""But I don't know how!"" exclaimed Madeleine angrily. ""What is this danger? How am I going to explain it? It's impossible!""

""Certum est quia impossibile est,"" said Mrs Who. ""It is certain, because it is impossible. Latin. Tertullian.""

""Wwe wwill hhelp yyou,"" interrupted Mrs Which. ""Iff onlyy yyou ddidn't iinsist on uusing wwords...""

""You see!"" said Madeleine. ""You tell me I have to write a book, and you don't even know what words are! You're horrible! I hate you!"" Tears filled her eyes.

""Now, now,"" murmured Mrs Whatsit. ""It's much better than you think. The words are all there inside you already, you just have to find them. If you don't mind, my dear, I will just take a little look through your memory.""

Suddenly, Madeleine had the strangest feeling. All the books she had ever read were lined up inside her mind like a huge library. And there was Mrs Whatsit, moving through the shelves with her, pulling down a book here and a book there...

""You see?"" asked Mrs Whatsit after a time. ""That was quite easy, wasn't it? I'm sure Out of the Silent Planet will be useful, and of course That Hideous Strength. Good old C.S. Lewis! And Olaf Stapledon's Star Maker. We want that lovely dance of the stars, don't we? Then we'll take Charles Wallace out of Odd John, and I think some Robert Heinlein and just a little bit of Plato, and now all you have to do is put them together!""

A moment later, Madeleine found herself sitting in front of her typewriter. The words poured out of her, as she covered sheet after sheet. More quickly than she would have believed possible, she found there was a thick manuscript on the desk. Dazed and astonished, she picked it up and began to read through what she had written.

""But it's terrible!"" she said, in bitter disappointment. ""So sloppily constructed! Such a lack of feeling for the English language! And it doesn't even make sense! None of it sticks together!""

""Goddag, yxskaft,"" agreed Mrs Who. ""Hello, ax-handle. Swedish. Saying indicating lack of coherence.""

""You must have faith,"" said Mrs Whatsit serenely. ""You may think it's terrible, but millions of children will love this book. They won't worry about the words. They will see the truth behind them.""

""On ne voit bien qu‚Äôavec le c≈ìur. L‚Äôessentiel est invisible pour les yeux,"" said Mrs Who. ""You only see truly with the heart. What is important is invisible to the eyes. French. Saint-Exup√©ry.""

""It won't work,"" muttered Madeleine. ""I'll send it to the publisher if you like, but they'll just reject it. They'll say it's silly.""

""Then send it to another publisher,"" said Mrs Whatsit. ""And another, and another, until you succeed. Listen, Madeleine. The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called, but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty. Now do you understand?""

""No,"" said Madeleine uncertainly; but she found that her fingers, all by themselves, had taken an envelope, put the manuscript into it, and addressed it to a publishing house in the city.

""Ggood ggirl,"" said Mrs Which. ""Nnow wwe hhave tto ggo. BBut wwe'll bbe bback."""

856,Virginia Ronan ‚ô• Herondale ‚ô•,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Feb 19, 2019",5,"‚ÄùHe grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.‚Äù

I think I must have been about fifteen when I read ‚ÄúThe Picture of Dorian Gray‚Äù for the very first time and I was totally blown away by it. There was this book, written in such a beautiful way, using such colourful and flowery language and there were those three amazing characters that made me feel and wonder and question their lives and decisions! 

You might say that up until I picked up ‚ÄúThe Picture of Dorian Gray‚Äù I was as innocent as Dorian himself. I didn‚Äôt know that there were books like that out there, that there actually existed morally grey characters, corrupted characters, book characters that felt like real people and could make you question their behaviour. It was an entirely new world for me and I was totally fascinated by it. 

So I read this book and I savoured every sentence, I devoured its wisdom and got lost in its pages! Looking at it in retrospective I think that Oscar Wilde actually was the first writer who didn‚Äôt only make me love classics but also the first author that ignited my undying love for villains and complex characters. And for that I‚Äôll always be grateful! 

I don‚Äôt know how often I read this book by now (goodreads your count doesn‚Äôt even get close to the actual number *lol*), but no matter how often I already read it, I‚Äôm still captivated by it. My fifteen year old me loved it as much as my 31 year old me does and if you ask me that‚Äôs exactly what makes a good classic. ;-) I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll never get tired of reading this book and I‚Äôll always discover new things about it. And I genuinely hope that many other people will read it as well. It‚Äôs definitely worth it! ;-)

The characters:


Warning: You are now entering the gallery of ‚ÄúSpoilery Spoilers‚Äù and since this is one of my all-time faves I‚Äôll probably end up writing an entire essay about it. If you prefer to stay innocent you better leave before my spoilers get to you and corrupt your soul! ;-P


Dorian Gray:

‚ÄùIt held the secret of his life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty. Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?‚Äù 

Dorian Gray! I don‚Äôt even know where to start! I love his character to bits and pieces and he‚Äôs definitely one of the most intriguing book characters I ever had the pleasure to read about. At the beginning of the book he‚Äôs so innocent and na√Øve and I totally agree with Lord Henry when he says that this is charming. Dorian definitely is a charming character! He‚Äôs beautiful and pure and whenever I read the beginning of the book I get a sudden urge to protect him against everything that‚Äôs going to happen over the course of those 256 pages! He‚Äôs like a child that gets corrupted by the bad influence of others and when I write this I really mean it! Even at his worst he still seems to retain that innocent outlook at things. I mean he was corrupted and tainted by Lord Henry, and he ends up corrupting and tainting his friends but despite all of this he still wonders why they have become like that. He‚Äôs completely oblivious to his own role in their downfall and when Basil confronts him with it, he doesn‚Äôt believe him. He is convinced that his friends could have done the right thing and that his influence on them isn‚Äôt as strong as Basil claims it to be. What is even more intriguing is that Dorian actually wants to be good! There‚Äôs a part of him that‚Äôs still innocent and hopes that he can be redeemed, but there‚Äôs also that other side of him that whispers that he‚Äôs entitled to do whatever he wishes to do. It‚Äôs obvious that he‚Äôs fighting an inner struggle and that he seems to have lost his way. It‚Äôs the century old question every person has to ask her/himself. Do I want to be good? And even more important: Can I resist being bad? It‚Äôs so easy to do the wrong thing and it‚Äôs so tough to do what‚Äôs right. I mean that‚Äôs the main reason why actors and role-players love to be the baddies! Being bad is fun, it gives you a lot of freedom and if you‚Äôre good at it the consequences never catch up to you. ;-P So Dorian constantly finds himself at a crossroads. Will he do the right thing or is he going to give into his bad side? Is his bad side truly that bad? Is having a little fun with his friends and to indulge in pleasure wrong or is it just a part of being human? The fate of Dorian Gray makes you think and it involuntarily causes you to face your own demons and weaknesses. It ultimately causes you to acknowledge your own vices and fears. In short: It makes you pause and forces you to ponder your own life-choices! And this is nothing but awesome! XD

‚ÄùI want to be good. I can‚Äôt bear the idea of my soul being hideous.‚Äù 

‚ÄùHe felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him ‚Äì life, and his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins ‚Äì he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all.‚Äù

‚ÄùI don‚Äôt want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them and to dominate them.‚Äù 

‚ÄùHe was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was eating his soul away.‚Äù

Lord Henry:

‚ÄùYou seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.‚Äù 

Ahh Lord Henry! How much I love that bastard! *lol* He‚Äôs quite literally the devil in this book. He‚Äôs the person that stirrs Dorian‚Äôs soul! He‚Äôs the man who leads him down that dark road and just like Dorian he is completely oblivious to the magnitude of his influence! Yes, he knows that he‚Äôs corrupting Dorian, he even finds pleasure and joy in it, but throughout the entire book he never truly realizes how much his words actually changed him! How much damage they did to his soul! Lord Henry is the kind of character you just got to love. Arrogant, intelligent, wise, self-confident, brutally honest and completely unapologetic about his inappropriate behaviour. It‚Äôs no wonder Dorian is so fascinated by him and isn‚Äôt only willing but also eager to spend his time in his company. Lord Henry is basically the embodiment of temptation and young and innocent Dorian wants to be seduced! And honestly, who wouldn‚Äôt be drawn towards a character like Lord Henry? I swear he says the wisest things and vocalizes the most accurate statements regarding society! He‚Äôs exactly the kind of devil you‚Äôd love to have on your shoulder! Plus there‚Äôs so much truth in his words that it hurts! XD

‚ÄùI make a great difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.‚Äù

‚ÄùI like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.‚Äù 

‚ÄùWe are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind, and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.‚Äù 

Basil Hallward:

‚ÄùWhen I like people immensely I never tell their names to anyone. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy.‚Äù 

If Lord Henry is the devil on Dorian‚Äôs shoulder then Basil certainly is the angel that sits on his other side. The painter functions as Dorian‚Äôs consciousness and as long as they know each other he always appeals to his good side and tries his best to sway him on a righteous path. He‚Äôs clearly the counterweight to Lord Henry‚Äôs corruption, but unfortunately he doesn‚Äôt have a lot of leverage. Well, at least not as much as Harry does! I mean the saying: ‚ÄúCome to the dark side, we got cookies‚Äù exists for a reason, right? ;-P In the end Dorian can‚Äôt stand his bad conscience any longer and does the only thing that‚Äôs seemingly able to liberate him. He kills Basil in order to silence his remorse and regrets, but what he didn‚Äôt expect is that this dark deed makes him feel even more tainted and guilty. So in the end Basil‚Äôs death only increased his sense of guilt and caused him to feel even more haunted. In my opinion the murder of Basil is the final nail in Dorian‚Äôs coffin and from that moment on he couldn‚Äôt be saved anymore. 

‚ÄùYou were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don‚Äôt know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.‚Äù 

The relationships:

Dorian Gray & Basil Hallward:

‚ÄùHe won‚Äôt like you the better for keeping your promises. He always breaks his own. I beg you not to go.‚Äù Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.
‚ÄúI entreat you.‚Äù
The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them from the tea-table with an amused smile.
‚ÄúI must go, Basil,‚Äù he answered.

And this is the key moment! The very first time Dorian Gray finds himself at a crossroads and choses the wrong path. You gotta love Oscar Wilde for the subtle intensity of this scene! There‚Äôs nothing extraordinary or special about it, yet it‚Äôs still the first choice that leads Dorian down his dark descent. It‚Äôs unagitated, ordinary and so very powerful! It‚Äôs obvious Basil loved Dorian and when I talk about love here, I‚Äôm talking about true love and not just friendship. He‚Äôs infatuated with him and basically worships the young and innocent Dorian. After he realises what Dorian has become, it‚Äôs already too late for him though. Poor Basil, if he would have known what his picture would make of Dorian, if he would have known how much Lord Henry‚Äôs negative influence would change his innocent and pure friend‚Ä¶. 

‚ÄùOne has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them there.‚Äù 

‚ÄùThere was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is the face of my soul.‚Äù
‚ÄúChrist! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a devil.‚Äù
‚ÄúEach of us has Heaven and Hell in him, Basil,‚Äù cried Dorian, with a wild gesture of despair.

Dorian Gray & Lord Henry:

‚ÄùWords! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!‚Äù

Okay, and here comes the moment when I say that Lord Henry and Dorian Gray are in love with each other. *lol* It‚Äôs so freaking obvious!! They are fascinated by each other, they are besotted with each other and they want to spend every free moment in each other‚Äôs company! So yeah, there‚Äôs that! I think their dynamic and their interactions are very interesting and to me it seems like Lord Henry is some sort of catalyst. He‚Äôs the impulse that changes Dorian‚Äôs soul, he‚Äôs the first person who opens Dorian‚Äôs eyes and tells him that he‚Äôs beautiful. Oscar Wilde uses him as his tool to initiate Dorian‚Äôs monumental change. Which is kind of interesting, if you consider that Oscar Wilde was gay. It feels like Dorian‚Äôs and Henry‚Äôs relationship is wrong and I‚Äôm not even sure if Wilde was aware of that? I mean yes, their friendship led Dorian into the abyss of his soul, which is pretty obvious if you ask me, but there‚Äôs some subtle note about their ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù. It‚Äôs like deep down Oscar Wilde thought that it was wrong to have intense feelings for another man. And if you consider the time in which this was written it‚Äôs not surprising that he might have felt that way. Lord Henry represents Oscar‚Äôs sins and vices and it becomes quite apparent that some small part of him might have bemoaned his sexual orientation. In contrast to Wilde no one holds Dorian Gray to account though. He gets away with all of his sins and in the end this eventually causes him to destroys himself! What a moral punchline! XD

‚ÄùTalking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the bow‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄùYes,‚Äù continued Lord Henry, ‚Äúthat is one of the great secrets of life ‚Äì to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.‚Äù

‚ÄùThe moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted.

""You know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different. I don't know which to follow.""

‚ÄùThe soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is a soul in each one of us. I know it.‚Äù

Conclusion:

This book is a gem! It‚Äôs perfection and so quotable that I could probably highlight each and every single passage! No matter how often I read it, there is always something new I didn‚Äôt notice before! I still wonder and guess about certain characters and ‚ÄúThe Picture of Dorian Gray‚Äù still causes me to think. The writing style is so beautiful I can‚Äôt help but fall in love with it. I fall in love with this book over and over again. Every time I read it I love it even more and I‚Äôm sure that I will adore this masterpiece until I‚Äôm wrinkled and old. 

Oscar Wilde drags us into the dark depths of the human soul, and once you get there you don‚Äôt want to return to the surface anymore.

857,Johannes,Brave New World,"Apr 17, 2008",2,"This book presents a futuristic dystopia of an unusual kind. Unlike in Orwell's 1984, Huxley's dystopia is one in which everyone is happy. However, they are happy in only the most trivial sense: they lead lives of simple pleasures, but lives without science, art, philosophy or religion. In short, lives without deeper meaning. Although people are expected to work hard and efficiently during working hours, during off hours people live in an infantile way, never engaging their minds, and satisfying themselves with sex and drugs.

The premise of the book I find quite interesting. However, the execution is lacking. The characters are not particularly endearing, and indeed they are quite flat. Worse, Huxley fails to explain why this future of controlled contentment is wrong. The reader will intuit that the this indeed a dystopia posing as a utopia, but Huxley's reliance on this feeling is a philosophical failure. It is the burden of the author to present us not with an account of something we know is bad, but to explain the source of the knowledge.

Huxley attempts something akin to an explanation in the second-to-last chapter, a discussion between ""the Savage"" who grew up outside civilization and Mustalpha Mond, a World Controller. However, the attempt falls short, as Mond has concise answers to all of the Savage's questions, and the Savage lacks the education and/or intellectual power to find reason behind his feelings.

During the conversation, Mond refers to philosopher Francis Bradley and credits him with the idea that philosophy is ""the finding of bad reason for what one believes by instinct."" Perhaps this inclusion is intended to convey that Huxley agrees and will make no attempt to manufacture a ""bad reason"" why the world he created is evil. However, I find this deeply unsatisfying. Why write a book to tell people what they already know? Moreover, a single reference to Bradley is not sufficient to convince me that this definition of philosophy is correct. If Huxley's novel relies heavily on this idea, he should have supported it with more than a solitary statement of Mond. Indeed, Mond promptly refutes the statement by denying instinct as separate from conditioning, and as the civilized population of the world seems to be controlled largely by conditioning, it would seem that in Huxley's world, Mond is correct!

In summary, Huxley crafts an interesting future world where people are blithely content without knowing passion or pain. Unfortunately, he fails both to craft an interesting story to set in this world and to write a strong philosophical argument why such a world would be harmful for mankind. He relies on the obvious faults of the world and the intuitive reaction of the reader, and thus provides no deeper insights.

As a social message, as a novel, and as a statement on the way in which mankind should behave, I find Brave New World inferior in almost every way to 1984. The one word of praise I will give to Huxley's novel is that his dystopia is more unusual and more intriguing than Orwell's. If only he had dome something more with it."
858,Jaclyn,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Apr 19, 2008",5,"I can't even begin to count how many times I've read ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" The truly amazing thing about these books is that each time you read them, they magically become more complex, more meaningful and more beautiful. I first read ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" when I was about seven or eight years old and I did not get it at all. Sure, I followed the story, but the deeper meaning was completely lost on me. Someone later told me that it was a Christian story and when I read the book again as a young teenager, I picked up on that element of it. In the many times I've read the books as an adult, I've come to find that the underlying meaning - not just of ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,"" but of the other books as well - becomes gradually clearer until you can't believe you didn't see it all along. The books are like Narnia itself, unfolding like an onion, layer upon layer, Narnia upon Narnia, but each layer is bigger and better than the one above it. 

In order of the events that unfold in the story (but not in the order that the books were published), the Chronicles of Narnia include:

""The Magician's Nephew"" - the Narnian creation story. Two children living in London are magically transported to other worlds and witness the dawn of Narnia. The story incorporates such familiar elements as a Tree of Knowledge and the fall of man.

""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" - Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, four children living in England during World War II, stumble through a magic wardrobe and discover the land of Narnia, which has been ruled for hundreds of years by an evil White Witch who has cast a spell over the land so that it is always winter but never Christmas. With the help of Aslan, the great Lion, they seek to free Narnia. This is the most obvious Christian parable, as Aslan represents Jesus and the story parallels the Resurrection story.

""The Horse and His Boy"" - Takes place during the Golden Age of Narnia, although most of the events unfold elsewhere, in the southern lands of Calormen and Archenland. Shasta, a Calormene fisherman's son, runs away when he hears his father negotiating to sell him into slavery. Together with two talking horses and a noble Calormene girl running away from an arranged marriage, he tries to get to Narnia. The book is a meditation on faith and the concept that God helps those who help themselves. It's also my favorite of the seven books.

""Prince Caspian"" - Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy return to Narnia to help young Prince Caspian recapture the throne of Narnia from his evil uncle Miraz. Not the most overtly religious of the stories.

""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" - Edmund, Lucy, and their obnoxious cousin Eustace, join Caspian, now King of Narnia, on a quest to find seven banished lords who had served his father. It doesn't seem all that religious until the end of the book, which encourages people to seek God in their own lives.

""The Silver Chair"" - Eustace, whose personality has dramatically improved thanks to his time in Narnia, returns with his school friend Jill to search for Prince Rilian, Caspian's son who went missing ten (Narnian) years earlier.

""The Last Battle"" - Eustace and Jill return again to Narnia to assist King Tirian, the last King of Narnia, in his final stand. The book is a parable of the End of Days, with chaos, confusion, war, unbelief and the worship of false gods. Tirian, Eustace, Jill and their friends can only hope that Aslan returns to Narnia to deliver them.

Read them, then read them again and again and again. You won't be sorry."
859,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),Wuthering Heights,"Jul 26, 2022",5,"Wuthering Heights is a story of great love and passion. It is a story of betrayal. It is a story of revenge. It is a story of complicated relationships in and between families. It is a story of rebels. It is a story of a few selfish characters who will try to do anything for their benefit. This is the beauty of this novel. It can be viewed from multiple angles, and we can see many embedded themes in it, giving us a different reading experience every time we read it in various phases of our life. 

Emily Bronte has crafted this story in such a way that the story of the Earnshaws and the Lintons and Heathcliff and Catherine will stay in our minds forever. If you are a lover of classics, this is unequivocally the book you should never miss.

 ‚ÄûIn a private journal and in a memoir for his wife, Golding said he tried to rape a 15-year-old girl when he was 18 and on his first holiday from Oxford‚Äú
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William...

‚ÄûHe had met her when both were taking music lessons in Marlborough, Wiltshire, when he was about 16 and she was 13, but he tried to rape her two years later when he was home during his first year at Oxford.
Golding writes that they went for a walk to the common and he 'felt sure she wanted heavy sex, as this was visibly written on her pert, ripe and desirable mouth'.
Soon they were 'wrestling like enemies' as he 'tried unhandily to rape her'.
She resisted and Golding, years later, wrote that 'he had made such a bad hand at rape' before shaking her and shouting 'I‚Äôm not going to hurt you'.‚Äú
‚ÄûA later girlfriend, Mollie, was also treated badly by Golding.
She was another local from Marlborough whom he later let down by breaking off their engagement because he had found her frigid.‚Äú
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...

‚ÄûThe attempted rape involved a Marlborough girl, named Dora, who had taken piano lessons with Golding. It happened when he was 18 and on holiday during his first year at Oxford. Carey quotes the memoir as partially excusing the attempted rape on the grounds that Dora was ""depraved by nature"" and, at 14, was ""already sexy as an ape"". It reveals that Golding told his wife he had been sure the girl ""wanted heavy sex"". She fought him off and ran away as he stood there shouting: ""I'm not going to hurt you,"" the memoir said.‚Äú

‚ÄûGolding, who won the Nobel Prize in 1983, three years after bagging the Booker for Rites Of Passage, admitted trying to rape a 15-year-old schoolgirl when he was an 18-year-old student at Oxford, according to a forthcoming biography by John Carey.
The schoolgirl put up a fierce resistance. But they had sex two years later, according to Golding, who nevertheless called her ‚Äúdepraved by nature‚Äù and ‚Äúsexy as an ape‚Äù in his unpublished memoir, Men, Women & Now. He wrote it for Ann, his wife of 50 years, to explain his ‚Äúmonstrous‚Äù character.‚Äú

Fringe philosophy
Downgrading and unintended satirizing of kids¬¥ language from an adult¬¥s perspective to seem capable of writing empathic and emotional, tragic-comic dialogues and characters is a cheap trick that fails epically, if not performed right. But it¬¥s the logical consequence of making kids act as if they were stupid animals to integrate a biased, boring, and one sided plot. If you want real philosophy on an island, read: 
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...

More bad philosophy on an island, read:
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...
This one has everything, racism, glorifying religious extremism, a true, clear picture of our past.

Back to the show, as it¬¥s often the problem with monopolies, the ones in art lead to overrated, hyped, and simply not good wanna be philosophical constructions. I mean, symbolic, metaphysical, allegory metaphor overload for young people who want to be entertained? Honestly? ‚ÄûDon¬¥t try to murder each other kids.‚Äú What a lesson! Of course, kids are so stupid that they immediately establish cultic dictatorships if they are not supervised, what else should logically happen. 

If this wouldn¬¥t be a typical forced read to torture school kids and a kind of pre pop psychology Nobel Prize higher literature with meaning drivel, I would say it¬¥s barely average, but because of its excessive misuse, it¬¥s just unacceptable. Possibly the ever so clever bureaucrats of the boards of education all over the world ought think a second about removing all the trash of all the lauded, boring, outdated, obsolete,‚Ä¶ literature each country tends to accumulate in a strange mixture of patriotism, cultural imperialism (our writers, literature, tradition) and think about including the great, amazing, wonderful worlds of literature kids and young adults want to read.

The worst classic I¬¥ve ever read
One extra star up to 2 could have been given for incompetently trying to be deep, philosophical, and critical and failing to transport the important message about the evil lurking in naked apes. Nice try, William, but just an epic fail, and total bigotry regarding your alcohol and abuse problems you loved to drivel about in your strange diaries of a molester. 
I was really searching for deeper meaning, any of all the arguments seen in positive reviews, but it¬¥s just unrealistic, the ending is a bad joke, putting as much symbolism and innuendos in it to camouflage the immense flaws doesn¬¥t really help, and it just fuels my opinion that, just as in real life, much of what is idealized and glorified is just bad and rotten. Look at the ratings of Golding¬¥s other books, rated by people who like to read classics! Another achievement in inability.

I know, there are many getting real pleasure out of classic literature, that¬¥s a question of taste and I don¬¥t force them to read my trivial literature. That¬¥s where the tolerance ends, because the problem is that the previously mentioned kids, teens, and young adults don¬¥t deserve to be bored with what elder generations may really enjoy, but has absolutely no worth for them. I did once make the mistake of reading a few dozen classics and most were just average, some really bad, but definitively close to none great. It¬¥s sad, avoidable, and just plain anachronistic to violently keep extremely outdated versions of descriptions of long away pasts in the curriculum and the main reason kids and teens hate to read. 

Irony time, there would be old, classic, clever books that could really tell something about human nature, not using placative over the top violence, especially in the classic and new sci-fi and social-sci-fi genre that explore many questions regarding human nature, state, politics, sexuality, economics, faith, but, they would be too extreme, progressive, and subtle. Cause bigoted conservatives don¬¥t want their kids to read really dangerous, meta context, social criticism, stuff, they want some characters far away from any real, imminent problems playing hide and seek with a freaking pigs¬¥ head. 

It truly left me speechless, just asking why, what¬¥s wrong with you, humanities, literary critique, Nobel prize, quality literature, higher art, snobs, modern art, don¬¥t you realize that you are satirizing yourself by praising so many works that many avid, lifelong readers, with k reading scores deem bad, arrogant, boring, and worthless? Reminiscences of a past when bigoted, unenlightened people celebrated any trash that could distract from their incredible cognitive biases. It at least also lets me imagine a purgatory library filled with this stuff and dark angels forcing me to read it until I become insane, repair my brain, and restart the process. Forever. Mwahahaha!

Trying to find an explanation, a combination of personal drivel with the biography of a disturbed mind
The author had issues, binge drinking and alcoholism were demons haunting him, and he did exactly write this one thing that made him famous and nothing else of importance. What makes one more disgusted is the fact that he, as mentioned, tried to rape a 15 year old girl when he was 18 (how often has he been successful and didn¬¥t write about it, because he was so completely wasted and drunk that he wouldn¬¥t even remember it?), a reason he should at least be retrospectively condemned, as retroactive, time travel castration isn¬¥t really an option. That¬¥s one of the crime areas where I distance myself from restorative justice and go full metal eye for an eye, archaic retributive justice, because I am of the opinion that sex offenders should be incarcerated under terrible conditions, life imprisonment without any chance to ever see the light of the day again (and this rehabilitation thing is complete, psychologic, psychiatric (2 other partly fringe science the humanities unleashed on humanity like a plague) nonsense. Nobody would try to ‚Äûcure‚Äú someone who is heterosexual, homosexual, or has a different gender identity than physical body, because that¬¥s completely crazy. But hey, someone who is born (seen in babies) or made a pedophile, rapist, necrophile, etc. can of course be healed. And, another very important factor, it¬¥s cheaper for the state to release serial sex killers to save some money and wait if it takes them weeks or months until the next victim is tortured, raped, and eaten. How is it possible that psychiatrists say that they are no danger anymore before and don¬¥t get any problems for their little oopsies?). However, such a tortured, poor soul, someone who raped as bad as he wrote, could become a celebrated highlight of highbrow s*** literature, which makes him worthy of even more fringe Nobel prizes, maybe for voodoo economics.

862,Jim Fonseca,The Fault in Our Stars,"Jun 29, 2018",5,"[Edited 1/15/23]

I didn‚Äôt intend to like this book. Not having read this author before, I thought, who is this guy who writes YA stuff and has a video blog? But I read it because so many of my GR friends have read it and rated it highly.

Indeed, it‚Äôs a great book and not just YA. It gives a brilliant picture of three bright young people (barely college-age) struggling to deal with cancer. How do they deal with it? With loving parents, friendship, sarcasm, cynicism, irony, tears and anger. 



The main character, a young woman, not only has to ‚Äúfight‚Äù terminal cancer but has to deal with knowing she, a single child, is the ‚Äúalpha and omega of her parents‚Äô suffering.‚Äù Her father is constantly in tears. She is devastated when she overhears her mother say, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be a mom anymore.‚Äù 

She falls in love with a young man who lost a leg to cancer, but is in remission, and who has just lost a girlfriend to cancer. Initially she won‚Äôt return his affection because she thinks ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a grenade‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt want him to lose a second love. She corrects her parents when they say ‚ÄúEven if you die‚Ä¶‚Äù with ‚ÄúWhen I die‚Ä¶‚Äù

There are so many reviews that I will just focus on the good writing, much of which is dialog.

‚ÄúBut, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is side effect of dying.‚Äù

‚ÄúOsteosarcoma sometimes takes a limb to check you out. Then, if it likes you, it takes the rest.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶my dad just kept telling me he loved me in this voice that was not breaking so much as already broken.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet I still worried. I liked being a person. I wanted to keep at it. Worry is yet another side effect of dying.‚Äù

On phone calls with her boyfriend: ‚Äú‚Ä¶we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes it seems the universe wants to be noticed.‚Äù This statement could be the thesis for a philosophical treatise on consciousness.

She calls one of the more sterile hospitals a ‚Äúprematorium.‚Äù

One young man accidentally puts his hand on the leg of another young man who is terminal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taken‚Äù he says.

And a real tear-jerker.

864,Richa,The Fault in Our Stars,"Dec 03, 2012",5,"I HATE this book. Absolutely hate it. Not just from the bottom of my heart (which would literally mean my ventricles, and so, no) but with my whole heart. I hate it, hate it, hate it.



I hate the fact that it made me laugh, so hard! 
I hate the fact that it made me smile, so much!
I hate the fact that it made me chuckle, so profusely!

I hate the fact that it gifted me with so much Laughter, Smiles and Chuckles when I was expecting to come face to face with tragedy at any moment....it changed my expectations, made me believe in Something which did not happen...or maybe did happen.

I hate the fact that while Hazel Grace 
fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once
, I just 
fell
...no warning, no time to process the myriad emotions coursing through me, nope, nothing, just a huge endless void-filled fall and then a sudden crash that took my breath away, like literally...



I hate the fact that I fell in love with this bound-to-end-in-oblivion, bound-to-end-in-disaster boy who stared with blue blue eyes and put the killing thing right between his teeth, but never gave it the power to do its killing. (Putting a cigarette right between your teeth and never lighting it, yes, that's Augustus Waters for you, people, a guy huge on metaphors and symbolism...that hopeless boy).



I hate the fact that when I least expected it, the story, the words just grabbed me and pulled me in so deep that even the thought of ever resurfacing never entered my mind.



I hate that the fact that right in the middle of my dance in the rain of laughter, dry wit, and humour without any warning, without any lightning as it's precedent, this thunder would stun me, startle me, wipe the smile right off my face, and sober me up, wake me up from the intoxication of the very real yet false jocularity spun by them, a humour which was nothing but human tragedy waiting-to-happen-and-had-already-happened in disguise and then push me back into that rain to dance again.



I hate the fact that I'm not making my much sense right now....that right now 
my thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations...


And yes, all the hate above is a metaphor, a symbolic word for love... weird, right? But right now I can't bring myself to say that I love this book....I don't, I don't, I don't (yes, I do, I do, I do...)



So, *deep breath*, it's a story of a girl named Hazel Grace Lancaster, a girl diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 13 who's still alive at 16 thanks to a miracle drug which didn't work it's miracle in about 70% of the people but it did work in her. 

So, even though her lungs suck at being lungs, she's still alive and well not kicking, but breathing, with difficulty (because remember her lungs suck at being lungs), but breathing nonetheless. 

She's been nothing but a terminal case ever since her diagnosis. The doctors are simply finding ways of keeping her alive rather than removing the cancer ridden lungs and replacing it with a new one, because let's face it, her chances of surviving such an operation are like next to nothing and why waste a good pair of lungs on a given, bound-to-fail body? 

So, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis.



Enter Augustus Waters. He's 17, gorgeous, in remission, and very frankly and much to her surprise interested in her. 

It's a match made in Cancer Kid Support Group, in the Literal Heart of Jesus (you'll know what that means when you read the book...you'll laugh, trust me, you will). 

He is a tenured professor in the Department of Slightly Crooked Smiles with a dual appointment in the Department of Having a Voice That Made My Skin Feel More Like Skin. 

He's the unexpected, hot, gorgeous twist in her story...a story which is about to be completely rewritten...





Their story begins with a staring contest...he stares at her...



So she stares back...because let's face it...



(Spoiler Alert: She wins.)

And it progresses into something brilliant, something as bright as the stars, into Something with a capital S....



I hate this book. (This needs indefinite repetitions, I hate it).

I hate the fact that I fell in love with their always. 
""Okay""






I hate the fact that Hazel Grace took the words right out of my mouth when she said what she said about being a vegetarian...


""I want to minimise the number of deaths I am responsible for,""
 

and about not knowing what's cool...


""I take a lot of pride in not knowing what's cool.""




I hate the fact that I fell in love with this blue-eyed boy who drove horrifically and his cheesy and yet very endearing attempts to be Prince Charming....(but more so with him...the surprised, excited and innocent side of him..)



""May I see you again?"" he asked. There was an endearing nervousness in his voice.

I smiled. ""Sure.""

""Tomorrow?"" he asked.

""Patience, grasshopper,"" I counseled. ""You don't want to seem overeager.""

""Right, that's why I said tomorrow,"" he said. ""I want to see you again tonight. But I'm willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow.""





I hate the fact that Hazel Grace felt like a grenade and all she wanted to do was minimise the casualities when (not if but when) she blew up...



I hate the fact that I felt sorry for a lonely swing set...a Desperately Lonely Swing Set Which Needed a Loving Home...or maybe it was simply a Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Which Sought the Butts of Children...and the fact that I absolutely love this sentence....





The Lonely Swing Set...

 

or maybe Just Vaguely Pedophilic...



And even though I fell in love the way you fall from a cliff or a building, (don't really know how that feels..since I've never done that)..I hate the way she fell in love...







I hate this kiss....because for who so firm that cannot be seduced?



And then we were kissing. My hand let go of the oxygen cart and I reached up for his neck, and he pulled me up by my waist onto my tiptoes. As his parted lips met mine, I started to feel breathless in a new and fascinating way. The space around us evaporated, and for a weird moment I really liked my body; this cancer-ruined thing I'd spent years dragging around suddenly seemed worth the struggle, worth the chest tubes and the PICC lines and the ceaseless bodily betrayal of the tumors.





I hate the love letter she wrote him...(Spoiler Alert: It's a Venn diagram love letter.)

I hate the fact that she did not agree with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (in which Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist, claimed that certain needs must be met before you can even have other kinds of needs.) Something like this...



Unless and until your needs of the previous level have been fulfilled, you don't even think about the needs of the next level. Of course, like all psychological theories this one too cannot be generalized or accepted universally. Because if there is one law in psychology then it is that there is no law in psychology, there is no given universal laws for human behaviour or thoughts or anything. Every theory has it's use and flaws, applicable to some while not applicable to others. And this one is not applicable in this situation. Nope, not at all. 

I hate the words, the word play in this book...
a quantum entanglement of tubes and bodies....triumphantly digitized contemporaneity....


I hate the fact that it made me laugh so much, smile a lot, fall in love so hard only to exact revenge later on for giving in to the false security of humour and love by making me cry....oh god, cry so much....so much...


Because that's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt.


I get it...totally get it...



I hate the fact that I ever read this sentence...


""I lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel Grace...""
. 

I hate it, I really hate it (forget metaphorical resonances, forget symbolism, I actually hate it).



I hate the fact that it made me cry so much that the lovers of-god-knows-which-century entwined on my pillowcase were drenched in the torrent of my tears and were probably ruing the fact that there was no umbrella during their time.



I hate the fact that I stayed up whole night reading this book, half of the night crying, and even after finishing it I couldn't go to sleep, so the rest of the dawn just pacing in my room with all these haphazard, desultory stars jumping around in my mind finding absolutely no avenue to become constellations.....and my eyes puffy (Note to self: Do not stay up all night or add crying to it if you do to avoid puffy eyes.)



Why do I do this to myself??



And I absolutely hate this...



I hate that this story is stunningly overwhelming, insightful, irreverent, raw and devastating...and to quote Markus Zusak, it's the kind of story reading which ""You laugh, you cry and then you come back for more.""




Some infinities are bigger than other infinities...
...I'm grateful for having known this little infinity...grateful for this epic love story of two star crossed lovers....

I like my choices. I hope you like yours.



And by hate you know I meant love, right?

I love this book.

865,Mario the lone bookwolf,The Lightning Thief ,"Mar 06, 2018",5,"Riordan enters the Mount Olympus of comedic fantasy

By smartly combining the old classic tales with modern settings
It¬¥s a bit like Good Omens by Pratchett and Gaiman, just as a longer series and with a focus on fast, funny, and creative clashes of old mythology and today's life. The message, as so often, is that 

It¬¥s completely ok to be different
And that individual character traits and issues are nothing that legitimizes stigmatization, or the tendency to give pills and psychotropic drugs instead of alternatives such as therapy in not so severe cases. But that¬¥s more of an unimportant sidenote, the really big riddle and mystery is the question which manifestation of a classic god will come next in which outfit, style, and with which modified abilities. This searching for the signs, hints, and innuendos is 

What makes it so appealing for adult readers too
It¬¥s not just quick, clever, and witty, one is also permanently questioning which obvious or deep and subtle disguise ones favorite mythological figure might have chosen. Riordan milked this concept in other series with different mythologies from around the world, or at least Scandinavia and Egypt (as far as I know but I¬¥m a bit outdated so there might already be fresher serialized stuff ) and it always worked out fine because it¬¥s so fresh and original. And even Gods have to evolve to stay up to date, funky, and fresh for the true believer.
 
If you like that kind of easygoing, but still ironic and somewhat even postmodern, kind of entertainment in the comedic fantasy YA and adult sector, Terry Pratchett, Jonathan Stroud, Walter Moers, Brandon Mull, and everything in similar amazon comparison or goodreads listopia genre/author meta suggestion function could be your new reading drug of choice. But be aware, it¬¥s such fun to consume that one tends to just read dozens of these giggle pearls instead of more complex and difficult to read stuff. At least if one is such a lazy master procrastinator as I am.

866,Lisa of Troy,The Giving Tree,"Mar 15, 2022",1,"Should Be Called The Codependent Tree

There is a boy and a tree. The boy constantly asks the tree for things. Even as the boy grows old, he never stops asking the tree for assistance. He never does anything for the tree. And the tree is happy.

Every time I read this book, it gives me a queasy feeling. It is a visceral reaction. This book doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. Why would anyone have to be a shell of themselves to make someone else happy? Why does a one-directional relationship make the tree happy? Why does the boy think it is okay to keep asking of the tree when he never gives back? Why doesn‚Äôt the boy mature as he gets older?

867,Emily May,Nineteen Eighty-Four: George Orwell ,"Dec 05, 2010",5,"This was the book that started my love affair with the dystopian genre. And maybe indirectly influenced my decision to do a politics degree. I was only 12 years old when I first read it but I suddenly saw how politics could be taken and manipulated to tell one hell of a scary and convincing story. I'm a lot more well-read now but, back then, this was a game-changer. I started to think about things differently. I started to think about 2 + 2 = 5 and I wanted to read more books that explored the idea of control."
868,Lu√≠s,O C√≥digo Da Vinci,"Jun 24, 2020",1,"Was that the book that made the Vatican tremble? This detective story builds like a TV movie where a handsome guy and a girl strive to solve a schoolboy's riddles to discover the scandalous secret that everyone already knows. The fact that Jesus was a man, that he fucked Mary Magdalene and impregnated her (why not?), and that he was not God's son. Dan Brown was ignoring, in a novel that uses and abuses the notion of mystery, the mystery of the identity of Christ, true God, and true man.
Let's move on. The Da Vinci Code is nothing more than a new version of Indiana Jones, in the American style, with the initial murder, the police error, the (so little) incredible escape of the heroes, the betrayal of the good guy becoming Machiavellian, the hidden microphones, two or three deaths lying around, the reunion of the lost grandmother and brother and the final kiss, prudish, without the slightest trace of eroticism. Yet, simultaneously, the whole book applies itself to magnify the Sacred Feminine.
How, then, to understand the dazzling success of this novel? Let's face it: I let myself take. This feeling of collaborating in the truth's discovery upsets the world's order by deciphering anagrams. This satisfaction of feeling oneself the discoverer as if the solution of a sodoku could collapse an entire civilization. At this little game, the end of the book can only disappoint. Nothing. This scum. Virgo worms. That's to designate only the cup, the chalice, and the Holy Grail. The real mystery is undoubtedly there: by what miracle can a little detective story of nothing become a world affair? Revealing this secret seems much more complicated than Dan Brown's treasure hunt."
869,Kat Kennedy,Divergent ,"Aug 17, 2011",5,"Today I almost attacked a man in public. A man who was yelling at and abusing his partner. Kicking the trolley, shoving her and screaming obscenities at her. I ditched the trolley I'd been pushing and stormed toward them, my mind blank of anything but ruthless fury.

The next part was like out of some stupid romance novel. Mr Kennedy pulled back on my arm and said, ""No. There is no way you're going over there!"" He took off the baby sling, handed it to me and sent me to go put the groceries and baby in the car while he handled it.

Usually that's the part of the novel where the female heroine swoons or something but I only got angrier. Did he just relegate me to child-minding and packing away groceries? Because I have a uterus? To say I was unimpressed would be an understatement.

Never before have I actually wanted to be a man. I love being a woman and I think being a woman is a fantastic thing to be. But I wanted to kick that man's ass. I absolutely hated myself for being weak and puny. It's not fair. To not be able to fight your own battles, to not be able to stand up for weaker people when you want to. It's so, incredibly, painfully unfair. Why can't I have big muscles? Why couldn't Mr Kennedy wait by the car while I got to go up and play harpsichord with his lower intestinal tract? Why must I swallow my pride and accept that I'm just not as strong or muscular as Mr Kennedy?

Perhaps it's that drive that made me connect so much with Tris. I wonder what kind of personality types would enjoy this novel? I've seen a lot of three star reviews and I just can't fathom why when this book was a solid five stars for me. Even with it's somewhat implausible storyline I loved it.

I loved all the characters, especially Tris, for being a hardass, cold motherfucker when other YA protagonists would whither and melt into a gooey puddle of patheticness. 



Maybe I connected with it because I could absolutely imagine being Dauntless. Catching moving trains? Abseiling? Fighting? Sign me up now. I think I would have loved every minute of it.

The writing was quite smooth and the action sequences were clear, concise and well-explained. The pacing and the plot never really give up, making this book difficult to put down. 

Over all, I thoroughly loved this novel. I'm hard-pressed to come up with any flaws or issues that annoyed me.

Most of all, it made me wish I really could kickass and take names like Tris does. Perhaps taking up kickboxing would be a good place to start.

870,Bookworm,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Oct 04, 2011",2,"It's a genuinely good series. Very inventive and original. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was so god damn boring. Descriptions were tedious, fight scenes were tedious. I couldn't wrap my head around the story in general. Sometimes I skimmed whole paragraphs and pages and understood everything that was happening just fine! Honestly, I'm still wondering where the hell I got the patience to sit down and read the whole thing. Especially with so few female characters (thank god for Eowyn). I recommend it for people who like fantasy and don't mind unnecessary content."
871,Jennifer,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Oct 23, 2007",0,"Yes, I've been living under a rock."
872,K.D. Absolutely,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ,"Jan 27, 2010",4,"How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with this?

I have to get this right. As of this writing, I have 98 Goodreads friends. 61 (62%) of them have read J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Out of those who read this, 39 (64%) rated this with 5 stars. 11 of them with 4 stars. All the others gave 3 or 2. Only 2 rated this with 1 star. One of them admitted not being able to finish it. She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety. (But she is my friend and it is her right, so why question?)

When the book came out in 1998, I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside. I read only those books that my brother told me to read. He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype. However, when Warner Bros. released the film adaptation in 2001, my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that, since there was too much hype, the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father-daughter movie date. I was wrong. She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life-size human chess game, in that scene when Ron was sacrificed. We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it: 
I will never read Harry Potter
.

My daughter is now 15 going 16. She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter. However, I am now a bookworm and the other week, I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved (two of them, again) about Harry Potter books. Oh well, first-time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters, Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read. So the following day, I bought my copy.

After 13 years of the book's existence and me ignoring it, did I finally make a good decision of reading it? Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars? Most of them did not bother writing a review. Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet. But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long.

These are what some of them say: it was a great book 
i enjoyed reading it For an eloquent reviewer, she must have been too happy to express herself.  Such a great story and creative way of writing. I love Harry Potter.  Yes, I agree about the story being great and J. K. Rowling being creative.  I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too! It was silly, but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter. Honestly, I still am :) It was a great book. I enjoyed reading it Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads. I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though.  Honestly, I don't know anybody who'd refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards. Another one of my favorite reviewers. That seems to have nailed this. Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery. That should be it! The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs, pigs, ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points (money) for our family!

Oh well, the Bible says that sorcery is Satan's work. The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school. Blasphemy.

Just kidding. This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it. I was just kidding. To be frank, I tried hard not to like this. I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are, up to now, ignoring this book. I told you so! Why waste your time? . However, unless you are a grumpy old man/woman, there is nothing not to like about this book. I maybe too old for it but hey, talent is talent and J. K. Rowling has it!

My 39 friends are indeed right!"

Ecclesiastes 3:1-8

My second time reading this dark cautionary tale from Ray Bradbury. While reading it I realized I did not remember much from the first time. Of all the post-apocalyptic tales I have read, this is probably the simplest yet most terrifying.



Published only 4 years after the book 1984, it is obvious where post WWII fears were driving our mindset. It is also very evident how modern dystopian stories have taken direction from these mid-20th Century classics. And, in our current political climate, fears like this are coming aground again: war, government control, freedom lost, etc.

If you love modern dystopia, but have not read this . . . you need to!

If you are a fan of classics and have not read this . . . you must!

It is not a happy tale - it is deeply disturbing with very little hope, but maybe the more people that are aware of its message the safer our future will be.

There is some really terrifying fan art out there for this book:"
874,RM(Alwaysdaddygirl),J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Dec 30, 2017",5,Reread them over and over
875,Emily May,Fahrenheit 451,"Aug 21, 2012",2,"As I write this review, the year is 2012. We do not live in a perfect world; in fact, in many ways we don't even live in a good world. But one thing I believe with all my heart is that we live in a world which, on the whole, is better than it was fifty years ago. Now, I know I'm writing with limited perspective and that progression and development hasn't been the same all over the globe and even the definition of those words can change depending on what part of the world you live in. But here's what I do know: the average world life expectancy is higher, the infant mortality rate is lower, access to education is greater and the amount of countries that hold regular, fair elections has increased.

On average, people today are smarter than they were fifty years ago. And I know this is where older generations throw up their hands in indignation and start yelling about how exams were much harder in ""their day"" and they really had to work for it. I am not disputing this, I have no idea if it's true or not. But what is true is that more people today than ever before are going on to further education after high school, the barriers that once stopped the working class from being as smart as society's more privileged members are slowly starting to break down bit by bit. Literacy rates have been on the rise the whole world over:



It's true. We have entered the age of computers and electronics, social networking and personal media players... and the world has not ended, the robots haven't taken over and people haven't become so stupid that they feel the need to rage a war against books. And this is the main reason why I think Bradbury's dystopian tale is out of date and ineffective. The author was writing at a time when technology was really starting to get funky, the digital age was still decades away but people were doing all kinds of crazy things like listening to music with little cones plugged into their ears. Bizarre. 

Readers often choose to view Bradbury's story as one about censorship instead of technology because that allows a more modern reader to connect with the world portrayed. But taken as it was intended, I just don't share the author's sentiments. Not all technology is good, but I'm of the opinion that the good outweighs the bad: medical advancements, entertainment, access to information via the internet... I'm the very opposite of a technophobe because, in my opinion, forward is the way to go. And I'm sure it's because of the age I was born into, but I cannot relate to the apprehension that Bradbury feels when he tells of this true story (note: this is not in the book):

""In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451 I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.""

I know many still think today that we are becoming a completely unsociable species because of mobile/cell phones, social networking sites, etc. but I have made friends from all over the world thanks to technology. I have talked to people that fifty years ago I would never have known, I have learned about different cultures and ways of life because I have access to most areas of the world through the web. So, no, I'm not scared of this so-called technological threat that is somehow going to turn our brains to mush and create a society where we cannot concentrate long enough to read a book. And here is where I (finally) get on to details of this novel.

What I am supposed to believe in here is that - because of technology - humanity has become so stupid that they couldn't concentrate on books. So books were simplified at first for easier understanding, then banned, then burnt. Why? I am okay with the realistic aspect of ""people have short attention spans because of technology so they don't want to read books"", but why burn books? I don't see why this would need to happen and why it would become a criminal offense to have books in your home. This is where I understand why so many people prefer to apply this novel's message to censorship, because it works so much better that way. The argument for the technological side of it is weak - even for the time in question.



The best thing about this whole book is the discussion about the phoenix and the comparisons made between the legendary bird and humanity: in the same way that the bird dies in flames only to be reborn again from the ashes, humanity constantly repeats mistakes made throughout history and never seems to learn from them. Secondly, to give credit where it's due, the writing is suitably creepy for a dystopian society and I understand why people who do actually share Bradbury's concerns would be caught up in the novel's atmosphere. But, overall, this wasn't a great dystopian work for me, I didn't agree with the point it was trying to sell me and I don't think it made a very successful case for it. Furthermore, I had some problems with the pacing. The book is split into three parts and the first two are much slower and uneventful than the last one - which seems to explode with a fast sequence of events in a short amount of time and pages. Disappointing."
876,Kat Kennedy,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Feb 09, 2010",2,"I almost feel that the author wrote this book in two halves. The first half she wrote while at the pique of her ability and enthusiasm. The second half she wrote while on some very impressive anti-depressants.

The first half of this book is sweet, wistful, beautiful and touching. 

The second half of this book is heart breaking, depressing and sloppily written.

I finished this book wondering what the hell I'd actually gotten out of it. My not-so-startling conclusion was: nothing.

When I read a book, I like to come away with something - even if it's merely a story worth remembering to cherish in my mind, or a lesson well learned, or an experience I'll probably never have but I now felt as though I'd had. 

This book offers none of that and I'm wondering why Ms. Niffenegger actually wrote it to begin with? What was she trying to say with this story?

Marriage sucks? Religion is for the young and naive? True love lasts until the first heart breaking obstacle?

When you figure it out, please tell me."
877,Carol,Romeo and Juliet,"Jan 27, 2013",5,"Excellent! I can't believe I've waited so long to read this classic play! Having only surmised the story of ROMEO AND JULIET and not even seen the movie (yet) I now know Romeo was a Montague and Juliet a Capulet, two houses at odds. I know about the disastrous duels, the secret marriage, the surprise suitor and the botched plan; and then there's the fatal ending..... I even had that wrong, and OMGOSH they were so young!I enjoyed actually reading Juliet's melodramatic expressions of love.....""O Romeo Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"" and ""Good-night, good-night! parting is such sweet sorrow....That I shall say good-night till it be morrow."" But, IMHO, none were better than this one......
""Give me my Romeo. And, when I shall die

Take him and cut him out in little stars,

And he will make the face of heaven so fine

That all the world will be in love with night

And pay no worship to the garish sun.""
Bring on more Shakespeare! Unforgettable read!

Oh Boy! Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 movie version of Romeo and Juliet is excellent! Just like reading the screenplay. Loved it!Thank you GR friends Sara, Lisa and Jonetta for the recommendation!"
878,Helen (Helena/Nell),Lord of the Flies,"Jul 07, 2007",5,"Over the years I must have read this book five or six times. Last night I was reading it on a train with a highlighter in my hand, because I decided to teach it this year again. Teachers wreck books, of course. We all know that. On the other hand, whatever you have to study-read, you tend to carry a bit of it with you. You don't forget that book, at least. Although I must add, that it's quite risky introducing to a Scottish classroom a book with the memorable words: ""The English are best at everything....""

I wasn't sure how much it would have dated. I must have read it for the first time 30 years ago. Published in 1954, the phrasing would have been pretty modern then. Even now, most of it has work well. The phrase that jumped at me -- and it only appeared once -- was when Piggy (I think) compared the boys detrimentally to 'niggers', instead of just 'savages'. Ouch. Mental note to make them look hard at this bit. After all this is such a horrible little group of boys. As complacently white as can be, one group of them from a choir school (or a public school with a choir), no less. And Ralph, the 'hero', son of a naval officer. 

Golding, as a teacher in an upmarket school, presumably knew those sort of boys all too well. The boys being prepared to carry the empire forward.

Except the setting suggests the empire may not be going forward. Somebody somewhere is fighting a war that is evidently nuclear. It's never quite clear what is going on or how the officer turns up cool as cucumber on a naval cutter at the end.

Most of the young people in my class this year have (sigh) seen the film, so they know what happens. The group of boys marooned on an idyllic Pacific Island first start off having a sort of cheery adventure. There are references to Coral Island, Swallows and Amazons and Treasure Island too. They want to have fun, and one of their number -- Jack -- talks a great deal about 'fun', though his idea of fun is killing pigs.

They arrive a fairly civilised little group but they gradually degenerate. Golding's moral message is about the ""darkness of man's heart"" and it's a good moral companion to Heart of Darkness now I come to think about it. The boys natural fears escalate and the younger children create a mythical 'beast', which then seems to materialise as a fact when the body of a dead airman, killed a war fought in the skies overhead, floats down to the island in a parachute.

But the real beast is their own desire for control and domination, as well as an interesting bloodlust -- the word 'lust' is used of this, and the killing of the first pig is certainly described with unmistakable sexual resonance. One of the boys pushes a sharpened stick ""up her ass"". There are no girls in the group -- what a different novel it would have to have been if there were! -- but the pig they kill is a sow, and they interrupt her in suckling a brood of piglets. What a strange, strange thing to put into your novel. Not just the killing, but the slaughtering of a mother pig and a kind of sexual frenzy. Yuk!

But hey -- he's intending to shock. He's intending to show that this blood lust thing isn't far away from human kind, or male human kind at least, and that it doesn't take much to call it out. Even Ralph, the Aryan protagonist, feels himself getting caught up in it. Paint your face, start whooping and chanting and you can do, it seems, almost anything.

The kind, poetic, imaginative Simon gets butchered (teeth and nails at this point -- not spears). PIggy is despatched by Roger, the executioner. The whole of their little society is clearly turning into a Stalinist regime, with each boy taking his place, as prescribed by Golding, which is what you get to do when you write an allegory.

It's a powerful read, though more repetitive, in linguistic terms, than I remembered - almost as repetitive as D H Lawrence in places. At the highpoint, towards the end, when Ralph is completely isolated and being hunted down, the word 'ululation' is done to death. But at least you can't read this book without learning what it means!

What I both like and  don't like about it is the way it makes me want to argue. The whole thing is completely manipulated. Is this what would happen? Would the darkness of man's heart take over? 

I have not much doubt that man's heart is dark, I guess, but when I got off the train I left my very lovely reddy-orangy furry scarf, and the chap who was sitting opposite me (I didn't speak to him during the journey) ran after me with it. It brightened my day. Perhaps he was a 'Simon' and would quickly get trampled if our civilisation were to decline.

But look Golding, my lad -- that bit where you allow the man in the parachute to get dumped, dead, on the island, scaring the boys out of their wits -- if that hadn't happened -- your choice plot element -- well, the three boys Jack, Roger and Ralph, would have established Absence of Beast. It might all have turned out very differently.

If Piggy hadn't been wearing glasses, there would have been no fire....

If it had started raining sooner....

If Ralph had been a bit more intelligent....

If the pigs had been a bit better at getting away....

On an island, living on fruit and getting scratched and cut, one or two of them would have developed fatal infections and their main enemy would probably have been illness and death, which would have drawn them together a bit. Even the biting insects would probably have driven them potty. One or two of them, it's my bet, would have descended into depression and just dwindled away.

It wouldn't have been like The Coral Island, but it wouldn't have been the inevitable collapse of civilisation either. 

Steven King likes this book. It fits beautifully with his love of dramatic thriller, increasing isolation of central brave character, and underlying opposition between good and evil. Here evil wins, though. 

Ralph is about to be exterminated when the officer arrives, so the deus ex machina is just there as an ironic way to end the book. That bastard is even 'embarrassed' when Ralph bursts into tears. That's British stiff upper lippery for you. 

I don't believe, in the boys' behaviour. I don't believe that Jack, the killer (I nearly said Jack the Giant-Killer), is there just below the surface, although I do believe that wars bring out the worst in us. I don't believe that Roger -- just a little boy -- is the natural henchman, with a desire to execute his peers running just below his veneer of civilisation. 

But then perhaps I do. I've seen it, haven't I? Seen nasty young people doing nasty young things nastily. Conditioned into that, in their turn, by not very delightful adults, damaged adults.

Oh bloody Golding -- go away! I put my money on man's intelligence. You gotta use your head to survive, whichever allegory you seem to be inhabiting. And sometimes you do survive and sometimes you don't, but the 'darkness of man's heart' is offset by the light, which always returns.

The trouble is, the dark heart goes for power - doesn't it? And the desire for power and control over others can be wielded quickly and wrongly by just a few people. It's what's happening all over the world at this minute.

And yet -- the majority are good-hearted souls, who will pick up your scarf on a train and return it to you. There are more good guys than bad ones. Some of them are quietly and happily reading books at this minute. Otherwise, what would be the point?"
879,Matthew,Crime and Punishment,"Sep 19, 2017",3,"I have few Dostoevsky fans in my friends list so my opinions here might not go over so well. I have been wanting to read this classic for a while and I had high expectations, but they were not met. I liked it okay but I found it to be a bit slow and drawn out. Ultimately not a whole lot happens in the story, but it takes 500 pages to get there. In fact, there are probably as many plot points in the 15 page epilogue as in the rest of the book.

However, despite this, I can say that parts of the journey were pretty good. Every few chapters there would be a high intensity event that would draw me in. In fact, if you graphed this book out with the high points followed by long lulls, it would probably look like an EKG. 



Also, it was interesting to take in the classic Russian writing. Whether or not it was always super exciting, I did enjoy the feel of the narrative from the classic Russian perspective.

In summary, I would not recommend this as highly as some other classics, but if you are hardcore into completing your classic reading list, you can't miss this one."
880,Henk,Dracula,"Nov 14, 2020",2,"The start was intriguing enough but around halfway, after one of the main characters died, it‚Äôs just the 19th century equivalent of conference call after conference call on how to destroy Dracula
How can woman help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!

Quite contrary to what I'd expected beforehand is that Dracula is not that creepy.
The book is almost soap like, in how the friends of Lucy are constantly frustrated in their efforts to protect her and how Renfield escapes from the mental asylum all the time. Also the structure of diary entries, telegrams and letters diminishes any tension one might feel, since apparently the people writing lived to tell the tale. For anyone curious, the 1992 film which is on Netflix is quite close to the book when 400 pages of Victorian fiction is a bit too much and you'd like something scary for October.

What I did like and found a bit frightening were the passages of how the boat Demeter loses its crew, being isolated and far away from any help. And sleepwalking is tapping into some unconscious fears as well. Chapter XXV with the mind connection between one of the characters and Dracula reminded me a lot of the link between Harry and Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
But for the rest there is not much to really call this a horror novel.

Only halfway the book the speed picks a bit up, with four blood transfusions (I hope the patient was bloodtype O) and four burials in a few chapters. But after this point the book just falls into endless deliberations on how to beat Dracula, on bringing facts already known to the reader together and some questionable decisions to keep information from the group by Van Helsing.

In general Bram Stoker his writing is quite readable but also overdramatic and not very subtle. The themes and moral are simple: central is how the male forces of science (Dr Seward), aristocracy (Arthur), no-nonsense Americans (Quincy) and spiritistic Dutch lyricism (Van Helsing) are needed to face a threat. They even compare themselves to Crusaders, going to the East to destroy Evil.
The girl with the man brain (When most we want all her great brain which is trained like man‚Äôs brain, but is of sweet woman) is ignored and shut out after she helped them, and that the valiant men ignore all the signals, in an overly convenient fashion just to move the plot towards it's all too clearly set up climax.

Interesting for a decidedly post-Enlightenment book written around 1900 is the oversized role of religion and class society, one of the men being a Lord getting anything required done with ease, including obtaining client records and breaking in somewhere, while meanwhile everyone is bribed for inquiries all the time.

In the end I found that, in the Appendix of the Penguin Clothbound edition I read, Charlotte Stoker (his mother) writes much more eloquently about the terror of a Cholera epidemic than her son does in the whole book about the supernatural. Those short pages feel strangely like a precursor to the later The Plague of Albert Camus, while Dracula itself feels a lot more similar to the overdramatic, constructed and convoluted Wuthering Heights of Emily Bront√´."

‚ÄúA Wrinkle in Time‚Äù. How can I never have read this before??! Have I been living under a rock my entire life? 

This was utterly DELIGHTFUL, Amazing, Funny, Scary, Brilliant & Crazy Bold. In short, I loved it. Ok, and I admit, I didn‚Äôt read it. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Hope Davis - and she was amazing. That being said, thank you Madeiline L‚ÄôEngle, - ‚ÄúA Wrinkle in TIme‚Äù was mystical, magical and nothing short of fantastical. 

Thirteen year-old Meg Murry and her little brother, Charles Wallace end up going on a little trip.. (without their Mum or their siblings), to the 5th dimension. Mind you, they don‚Äôt go alone. They go with Mrs. What-Its, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Witch and a young man named Calvin. Yes, the 5th dimension exists my friends and the trip takes a mere second or two (see, I knew it!). It‚Äôs a terrifying trip, yet they go nonetheless. Why do they go you ask? To find and save Meg‚Äôs father, a scientist, who has been trapped on Camazotz for years. With help of Calvin, Mrs. What‚Äôs Its, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Witch and a friend she encounters named Aunt Beast, Meg is sent off to do the impossible.

Camazotz is an evil planet however, and Camazotz is being controlled by ‚ÄúIT‚Äù (not Stephen King‚Äôs ‚ÄúIT‚Äù mind you), and IT controls everyone and everything and if IT gets control of you, there is no getting free. Finding the strength to fight IT takes something special. It takes something that is inside of everyone who is human. Meg just has to find it. 

‚ÄúA Wrinkle in Time‚Äù surprised me. I didn‚Äôt have any idea how much I would love it. It was amusing, frightening, intense, intelligent, oh so magical. I simply adored it. I wanted to get to it before the movie came out in a few months and I am so glad I did. If for some reason, you are like me and have never read it, I highly recommend you either read or listen to the audiobook. You will not be sorry. A Wrinkle in Time will leave you breathless. One minute a huge smile will break out on your face, and you will be grinning from ear to ear and then next you will be clenching your teeth, scared for Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin, hoping against hope that all will turn out ok.

884,James,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jan 07, 2012",3,"3 stars to Audrey Niffenegger's novel, The Time Traveler's Wife, published in 2003 and later made into a movie. This one is a hard book for me to rate. There was so many great things in it, but there was also a lot that made me step away and think about how it all happened...





Overview


A young couple are constantly ravaged by the husband's ability to move between time periods, but rarely in a controlled way. They are stuck in a haphazard relationship, never knowing when he may just disappear for months at a time. As a result, readers put the pieces of their love story together chapter by chapter... knowing the conclusion to some things before you find out how it happened. 





What I Liked


1. The entire concept of moving around throughout someone's life, not knowing what time period it is until a few things happen. This created a lot of suspense and drama, which for the most part worked significantly well; however, on a few occasions, it pushed me over the limit of confusion.



2. It's a heart-breaking tale of what happens to a young couple who very much want to be together, in love and share a lifetime of orderly memories. Note, I said, orderly memories.



3. The images created are quite wonderful. With words being the tool to convey the emotion of something none of us have ever been through, it's especially important to have strong visuals. This was successful on most occasions. And when it wasn't, I didn't dislike it; just wasn't anything special.

4. It was unique... hardly ever, if ever, done before, in such a way or manner. The author should be praised for it.



What I Didn't Like


1. The concept was too complicated. I kept stopping to think if the author built the scene correctly. I naturally doubted it, assumed there was a mistake in the time sequence. Maybe that says more about me being a Doubter than it does about the book... OK, maybe I should stop here on this item.



2. Some of the passages were included purely for humor, and the effects on other people of his time travel were a bit too much. I'm good with someone getting beat up, or some silly naked embarrassment... but it felt too contrived and one-sided.

3. I wasn't happy with the ending... and that's all I say.



Now What


You really should read it and then watch the movie. It's a different way of handling the story, so that's why I suggest both. Ultimately, it's the kind of book where you think you love it, but then things start falling apart in your mind about the gaps and the confusion... and you feel like you had part of a story, not the whole thing. But this is one you need to check out for yourself. Just go in knowing it's not a brilliant and perfect piece of literature. Still a good story, and possibly a bit higher than a 3 on my scale, but I'm sticking with the rating.

885,Jason Koivu,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,"Jun 08, 2011",3,"People love this. Not me. Does that mean I'm not people? 

Usually I like scatterbrained, nonsensical stuff and that's probably my problem: I don't get the references. At least some of the wild and crazy antics seem to happen to prove a point about the ridiculousness of some or other quirky British convention. So maybe all the wacky shit that goes down in Alice in Wonderland has a deeply satirical basis? I must give Carroll his due, the satire that I did get I enjoyed. However, for me much of this fell flat and even occasionally annoyed me. Just the same, I will take this issue upon myself and promise to eradicate my lack of knowledge in the realm of archaic 19th century British mannerisms. Haha! Like hell I will!

Still and all, three stars is not hating a book and I don't hate Alice in Wonderland. There are many delightful characters and scenes. I'm glad I finally read it and am now able to separate the original from Disney's bastardized version."
886,Matthew,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Jul 17, 2019",5,"Amazing!

Heart-Wrenching!

Important!

In a world where people tend to make assumptions about people and places based on the news, preconceived notions, prejudice, etc., this book needs to be read. I think a good portion of the American population hears ‚ÄúAfghanistan‚Äù and they think it is a country full or terrorists and unreasonable Muslim extremists who all band together to plot the downfall of anyone not like them. A Thousand Splendid Suns shows the progression of life in Afghanistan from the Soviet takeover in 1980s through post 9/11 Taliban control. All of this is through the eyes of two women trying to live a normal and peaceful life just like anyone in the world wants. You will see that despite the extremists and unreasonable values of some, most of the Afghani people are no different than you and me.

Hosseini is a fantastic writer. Not only is the story enthralling, but the way he writes is engaging and easy to follow. I was never bored or confused. When I was not reading the book, I was thinking about the book and could not wait to get back to it and find out what happens. Sometimes you find the perfect book where the writing just falls into place with a click ‚Äì that happened with this one. While the story takes place far away and the life discussed unusual for me, he made it very approachable and understandable.

The characters were great. The ones I was rooting for I was REALLY rooting for. The ones that I despised I REALLY hated. When I get this invested in the characters, it is a sure sign of a great book!

I will end with this warning: while a great and interesting book, it is, at times, difficult to read. There are situations and scenarios that are upsetting and may trigger lots of emotion. If you are extremely sensitive, it may be difficult to make it through. But, if you can, I think it will be worth it in the end.

If you have not read this book yet, I think you should give it a try. The experience is very likely to be eye-opening and maybe even life-changing."
887,Lisa of Troy,The Help,"Apr 13, 2022",5,"OK. Wow. Wipes Away Tears.

The Help is a fictional story set in Mississippi in 1962. The perspective shifts between three characters: two black maids, Aibileen and Minnie, and a young white woman nicknamed Skeeter. Will these women be able to change the status quo and what will it cost them?

First of all, the audiobook is phenomenal with a full cast of characters. It is definitely on my list of top 10 best audiobooks of all time. Second, this book made me laugh and cry. It has a very conversational tone similar to Project Hail Mary but with no science and women instead of men. When the story rang out across my living room, I felt fully immersed in the story, just like Aibileen was sitting on the edge of my couch sharing her story. This was one of those books where you hoped that it wouldn‚Äôt come to an end.

The characters are unforgettable, complex, and imperfect. This book was incredibly fascinating because the stakes were so high for the maids. At any time if their employers were unhappy for any reason, they could be fired. Not only would they be unemployed, but no one would hire them with a bad reference especially in a small town. However, I think the title, The Help, is has more than one meaning. 

The plot was intricately woven together, and it felt realistic. At the end, I googled, ‚ÄúIs the Help based on a true story?‚Äù Apparently, this question is quite common. Based on my Google research, the author was sued by her brother‚Äôs maid, Ablene Cooper, for using her likeness.

This book tackles meaningful issues such as racial injustice, rejection, and being on the outside of a clique, fear. But it also covered love, hope, bravery, and children, the future. It was really a very beautiful book, and I am grateful for reading it. This will be a strong contender for book of the year.

888,K.D. Absolutely,Divergent ,"Oct 19, 2011",1,"This book is just not for me. I should not have borrowed this. I should have ignored this book even if this is this month's read for our book club. I have no intention of attracting attention by disliking this popular book. I am just being honest to myself.

Please allow me to explain.

(1) Late last year, I read and liked Suzanne Collin's The Hunger Games. I don't read lots of dystopian and I thought I read it even before I read William Golding's Lord of the Flies. So, the idea of kids or young adults killing each other like how they do it in a TV reality show shocked me literally and it made me finish all the three books in that series. This despite my older brother making fun of me reading a YA book while our two families are enjoying our annual Christmas break in a resort. I did not care. The book was engaging and I had to continue reading.

Sadly, Divergent, by yet another female American writer Veronica Roth, uses the very same formula. There is nothing wrong with this tactic. Strike while the iron is hot. It is just not for me. The similarities are glaringly obvious: survival of the fittest, a virginal vulnerable girl in the brink of adulthood, first love, first kiss, defying convention, same love for the family, against all odds, despite all obstacles, triumph in the end, etc. DON'T KID YOURSELF into saying that this is different. These writers will continue to write this kind of novels as long as there are readers patronizing them. Let's all do ourselves a favor by moving on. Let's read books with new and not recycled plots. I know Veronica Roth, a graduate of creative writing, has many many other nicer plots in mind and let's encourage her to write a different novel so she has a better use for her creative juices.

(2) This book is for young girls. Maybe even for the girls who still dream of their young selves. It is a romance novel hiding under the cloak of dystopian genre. Traditionally, dystopian used to be a genre identified with male readers and crossing the line gives female readers the opportunity to show their tough side because they also read and appreciate dystopian books. However, read their reviews here at GR. They are all in love with Four or Al just like how they debated about Peeta or the other boy in THG. I would imagine that when Four was kissing Tris for the first time, those female readers who have never been kissed were imagining themselves as Tris. I should know. I am a father of a 16-y/o girl and we are closed the she tells me what she wants in a boy and who her crushes are. So, if you are a girl, DON'T KID YOURSELF that you enjoyed the killing here just like how the young male readers would have enjoyed it. 

(3) The plot lacks believability. The overall scheme of the society is not explained. For example, who put the Abnegations in the government? Isn't it that brains (of the Erudites) are also needed not only in running the government but also in all other things? Where do the factions get their income to run their affairs? Don't tell me that Amities just make friends all day long and they earn money to put food on the table just by being friendly. Again, going back to THG, at least Suzanne Collins, in the first book, made her milleu believable. But not Veronica Roth. She just thought that these questions are not important so she just labelled and grouped all people into five factions. Oh, how convenient. Then the readers just take everything in stride and say this is awesome!, this is the best book i've ever read. ever. And to think that the ones who commented these are male! Maybe they need to expose themselves into more believable novels say by George Orwell, Margaret Atwood, Aldous Huxley, Kurt Vonnegut, etc. All those dystopian or sci-fi masters. They'll see semblance of this book's basic plot in those earlier and definitely more brilliant works. They'll realize that they should not be saying that this is the best ever book as this is just a painful rehash of what those gurus have already written. DON'T KID YOURSELF that this is all-original.


Sorry, Maria. I perfectly understand why you love this book. It is just not for me. You cannot hate me anyway since we work in the same company and I know that my disliking this book is not enough for you to consider me your enemy. Oh, I agree that you and Four can make a wonderful couple ha ha! Thanks for lending me this book. :)"
889,Henry Avila,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Oct 26, 2011",5,"Alabama in U.S.A., 1935 during the crippling bleak, Great Depression, Atticus Finch a widower, struggling lawyer and ultimate believer in justice for everybody, (a gentleman, if ever there was one) is raising two small children Scout, (Jean Louise) and Jem, (Jeremy) a typical American boy, he likes to have fun in the fictitious mostly quiet , small southern town of Maycomb. The siblings are unusually close, the father is absent often being a politician in the legislature, in Montgomery, the state capital. Calpurina their black servant, takes good care of them and they all love, is the real parent of the kids, and of course, considered a member of the family. Mr. Finch is a rather remote uncomfortable father, the children call him by his first name of Atticus. Scout age eight, a tomboy, Jem who's four years older than his precocious sister and friend Dill, (Charles Baker Harris) a year older than Scout but not as big, and is frequently bullied, are always together. Dill from Meridian, Mississippi, spends the warm summers at his Aunt Rachel's house in town and is gratefully left alone. Next door to the Finch's live the Radley family, a strange people that keep to themselves, particularly Boo, (Arthur) a legendary creepy, mysterious man , who is never seen, weird stories abound about him by the curious, neighborhood kids, they test their bravery, by how close they can come to Boo's house. The gentle, Mr.Finch shocks Scout and Jem when he shoots a mad dog at the sheriff's request, Mr. Tate, knows Atticus's skill, but curiously he doesn't even have a gun at home, never seen with one either. This sleepy town awakens when Bob Ewell a lazy, notorious drunk, accuses a black man Tom Robinson of raping his flirtatious daughter, Mayella. The honorable Judge Taylor appoints Atticus, as Robinson's lawyer, an impossible task in that era. The trial brings people from all over Maycomb County , to the courthouse , Atticus Finch shines, but can he free an innocent man ? This story implies every human, should be treated with dignity, no matter what the color of their skin, and after so many years have gone by , is still the best novel in urging equality for all, what a concept..."

I finished the reread and increased the rating to 5.

Some quotes:

""Telling the turth is not cynical, is it?""

""It's not time to worry yet.""

""...we're making a step -- it's a baby step, but it's a step.""


February 20, 2023

Yesterday I started rereading To Kill A Mockingbird by listening to the audiobook narrated by Sissy Spacek. Today I got to where Atticus Finch tells his daughter Scout, ""Shoot all the Bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a Mockingbird.""

I read this in high school right after I saw the movie on TV. I don't remember much about the movie and even less about the book. I guess I'm due for a reread."
891,emma,The Fault in Our Stars,"Jul 07, 2014",1,"This is the John Green-i-est book of all John Green books, and I hate it and him more than anything. 

My sister and I actually have a running joke where we just quote this book back and forth to each other. Although honestly anytime anyone says ""It's a metaphor,"" I immediately say ""ya put tha killin' thing between ya teeth but ya don't give it the power to do its killin'!"", affecting the mannerisms of a stereotypical paperboy from the 1920s.

It gets a laugh every time. (Or at least a sound of disgust, which is just as satisfying within this context.)

There are just so many laughable quotes. ""I fell in love the way you fall asleep: Slowly, then all at once."" ""Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."" ""It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you."" ""Because you are beautiful. I enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence."" (That one is a good one if you, like me, love your friends a lot but are bad at compliments. This will ensure that they know you love them, but also prevent them from ever wanting to talk to you ever again.) 

Oh, and: ""My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations."" (That last one is probably my favorite, because it gets the most horrified reaction from the audience.) And how could I almost forget the classics: ""Maybe 'okay' could be our 'always.'"" (Also, of course I had to look up those quotes. While I love John Green jokes, my brain is so inherently opposed to him that I cannot memorize his sh*t for the life of me. I still mess up the killing thing between your teeth quote, and I say that one at least weekly.)

Anyway. It's comedy gold because this crap is cringe-worth-i-ly affected and pretentious and unrealistic, but also focuses on basic key words and concepts you can latch onto and bring up in pretty much any given conversation.

What? Yes, all of my friends do hate me. Why do you ask?

I am just about full to bursting and sick to death of John Green's quasi-profound books and boring guys and manic girls and token diverse background characters with one quirk and not much else. I don't know how much more pretentious dialogue and profound ponderings and fake teenage angst I can take.

Perhaps unsurprisingly,t his is not so much of a mini review, but I feel like I've had a buildup of John Green-directed anger of late. Don't get me wrong, I'm constantly boiling in it, just due to who I am as a person, but his return to writing and that ugly cover reveal are making me even madder. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, JOHN. IS THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WILL HAVE TO READ YOUR NEW BOOK, SINCE I HAVE LONG JUSTIFIED MY HATRED FOR YOU BY SAYING I'VE READ ALL YOUR SH*T AND DISLIKED IT ALL?

Can you tell that I somewhat irrationally believe he knows that I hate him? I've been so outspoken about it. Granted, over half of that outright opposition took place in my junior year AP World History class, but still. The man could have eyes everywhere. 

Why, you may ask, do I continue to scream about him if I'm so scared he and his cringey YouTube videos and rabid fans will come for my life?

Because he is horrible. I enjoy ranting about horrible people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence.

(This is part of a project I am doing wherein I write mini reviews of books I read a long time ago. Yes, I am aware that this doesn't exactly fit anyone's definition of a mini review.)"

893,"Fergus, Quondam Happy Face",Crime and Punishment,"Oct 13, 2018",5,"If you‚Äôve ever committed an unjust act, as Raskolnikov does, you know now it would have been better right at the outset to confess your injustice and seek the absolution of clemency.

For if you neglected to come clean you were probably racked with ruin within, and ‚Äúdelivered to the bondsman‚Äù of tortuous guilt. It happened to Raskolnikov, and it happened to me.

Each one of us is a Raskolnikov, you know.

No, not like you‚Äôre thinking - not a shabbily-dressed, impoverished murderer. But we all share his nature. To a T.

That, in essence, is the key to understanding Dostoevsky‚Äôs tortuous, convoluted, anxious prose - it‚Äôs the one message that Fyodor Dostoevsky takes anguished pains to drum into our insulated and isolated little heads!

Not that, hey, Raskolnikov‚Äôs not such a bad guy after all... no - it‚Äôs that he is inwardly bad and so are we, potentially at every moment, bad inside - and that that that will never change. 

We don‚Äôt change our inner lives; but we CAN constantly be making amends for our mistakes - and starting our life anew in others‚Äô eyes at each moment, though never perhaps to our own complete inner satisfaction.

For our selves aren‚Äôt static and we all invariably tend towards moral entropy.

There are no easy answers in Dostoevsky!

I remember so well the time I finally quit smoking - cold turkey, 22 years ago. I was lucky I did it, I guess; but to face the indefinitely long rest of my life - stretching out before me like a vast restless desert - without smokes, seemed unbearable back then!

It was just like the Zen Master says - reaching the top of a thousand-foot pole, and then, CONTINUING TO CLIMB. In empty air. Yikes!

Panic City! The flames of utter hopeless anxiety threatened to engulf me entirely.

So I started to pray. Nonstop. Like a dog chewing a meatless bone! It must have worked... so saith the Preacher.

And I escaped from that Inferno by the very Skin of my Teeth.

So likewise, there are few pat answers in Faith, no matter what we‚Äôve seen or heard: ‚ÄúOurs is only the trying,‚Äù Eliot said. Trying to make the best of a mess! 

And I wouldn‚Äôt be at all surprised if C.S. Lewis is right, and there remain plenty of challenges in Heaven.

So, there is no finality in this life, Dostoevsky is saying. We can‚Äôt rest on our laurels.

Or our guilt, either, for that matter!

The best way I can sum up my thoughts on this Everest of a novel is by quoting W.H. Auden:

‚ÄúFaith, while it condemns no temperament as incapable of salvation, flatters none as being less in peril than any other... Christianity is a way, not a state, and a Christian is never something one IS, only something we can pray to BECOME.‚Äù

And if Raskolnikov is not a Christian, neither are we.

But we must never give up the trying, just like Raskolnikov...

And for us, too, in time there may come Redemption.

And a Peace that passes all understanding, after the intolerable Shirt of Flame is extinguished, in

A condition of complete simplicity
Costing not less than EVERYTHING."

The Written Review






‚ÄúDon't try to make me grow up before my time‚Ä¶‚Äù
 The March sisters may be radically different but they all have one thing in common - love. 

Their love for their mother and father, their love for adventure and for each other unites them in this troubled time.

The Civil War is afoot and all the sisters can do is think about their father away and in battle. Their mother tries to distract them but often she can barely distract herself.

Jo, a radical tomboy and aspiring author - rallies her family with her amusing plays and scribbles.
I like good strong words that mean something‚Ä¶
 Meg, the beautiful sister, often puts her family first and holds them together when her mother cannot.
You don‚Äôt need scores of suitors. You need only one‚Ä¶ if he‚Äôs the right one.
 Amy, the youngest, was spoiled as a child and oh my, it shows. But even she can rally when life looks darkest.
I'd rather take coffee than compliments just now.
 Beth, sweet and good-natured, valiantly cheers on her sisters but her frail health often keeps her at the sidelines. 
There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping...
The sisters must face hardships their New England home. 

They must face things that they never would have thought possible.

But, even in the darkest of times, 
they will have each other.
 And that is most important of all. 
Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault.
This is probably my fifth or sixth time through and yes, I am totally going to read it again. 

There's just something about this book that's absolutely gorgeous and timeless.

I love the sisters and their relationships with each other - I see so much of myself and my cousins with their day-to-day interactions.

Jo, the darling, is the perfect mix of strength and fear. Watching her grow from a brash girl to confident young woman just makes my heart happy. 
You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.
And the message of the book! Ahh. My heart. So full.

It often feels like the messages from books in the mid 1800s are saccharine sweet or so heavy-handed with their themes that they're ridiculous. (Just look at the later Anne of Green Gables if you'd like an example!)

But this one had just the right mixture of loving family + religion + life lessons. It was beautifully balanced. 
Be worthy love, and love will come.
That being said, I do absolutely hate that (view spoiler)[ Beth has to die (hide spoiler)].

I swear, every time I reread this series, I practically rediscover that fact (my brain is incredibly good at selective memory-ing those sorts of things)...which makes it awful all the more.
 
Oh, and am I the only one who's still bitter over who Jo ends up with? This book may have been published in 1868 but this is my hill and I WILL DIE ON IT!

But don't let that spoil your interpretation - this book is truly wonderful. I love it.

895,Kat Kennedy,The Book Thief,"Jun 03, 2010",4,"Just to clarify: Yes, I did cry.

I've read a lot of positive and negative reviews for this book. I can see why people wouldn't like it - I really can. Perhaps because I took a lot out of it personally, I found I enjoyed it a lot.

Quick test to see if you'll like this book:

1. Did you like Anne of Green Gables?
2. Can you cope with an off-beat, melancholy, caustic, dead-pan, self-righteous narrator?
3. Do you like words?
(Questions 4-8 were all about what kind of underwear you're wearing so don't worry about them).

So, let's all gather around for story time with Mistress Kat.

Two incidents set me off lately.

1.	My neighbour came to me and complained about the Islanders (for those not Australian: the Tongan, Fiji, Papa New Guinea and New Zealand populations of Australia) causing trouble and otherwise defiling our great and beautiful nation.
2.	I was tooling around on Facebook when I noticed one of my friends (one of those friends you‚Äôve never met except in an internet community) hosting a link to a video of a speech from a man addressing the American people. I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to say that he is reminiscent of a neo-Hitler but let‚Äôs just say that the comparison would not be wholly unearned. Her comments on the video were that: everything he‚Äôd said was right, it was time that people sat up and listened for the sake of their country and that it‚Äôs about time ‚Äúsomebody did something‚Äù. (Fuck me, I‚Äôve heard this phrase so many times. What is it exactly that they‚Äôre referring to? Do they actually know? I‚Äôve yet to hear them pronounce what this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is or what it looks like. Is there some plan that I‚Äôm not aware of that they‚Äôre referring to? Does it involve chipmunks, honey and tequila?)

To my neighbour, I simply mumbled that I had to leave and got in my car. I was offended on behalf of my friends so I blew him off and I haven‚Äôt really spoken to him since. To my Facebook friend, I resisted the urge to make any comments. I debated about starting a fight that would, in all likelihood, spill over to our community. In the end I ignored her and I haven‚Äôt spoken to her since.

The Book Thief is not your typical WWII story. It doesn‚Äôt even ask you to sympathize with the Jews. Their plight is background to the story and their struggles and pains are rarely shown except through the pitiful/beautiful character of Max. This story actually focuses on the bad guys. Zusak assumes that you know about the struggle and the plight of the Jews. He assumes that you feel for them, that you are horrified on their behalf and so he doesn‚Äôt spend much time eliciting an emotion that you are expected to have.

Instead it focuses on the BAD guys. You get to know and live the lives of a small and poor town in Germany. The thing is, though, that these aren‚Äôt really the bad guys. Zusak, probably rightly, assumes that we‚Äôd never be able to really empathize and enjoy reading a book about characters truly bad. They‚Äôre not really bad. After all, they may be Germans and they may have escaped persecution and death, but they‚Äôre still poor. They‚Äôre the tiny fraction of the German population who sympathizes with the Jews. They harbour a Jewish man in their home and come to love him. The thing is though that for most of the novel, they‚Äôre not the good guys either. They don‚Äôt speak up for the Jewish people, they don‚Äôt try to change popular opinion, they don‚Äôt stand for what‚Äôs right. They quietly try to get by without causing waves and without risking much of themselves.

So you can see how I would sympathize. How could I think that I‚Äôm one of the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù when I don‚Äôt stand up for people either? Shouldn‚Äôt I have challenged my neighbour and asked how he knew that the Islanders were to blame for all the crime? Shouldn‚Äôt I have asked him how many Islanders he knew? How he could make such assumptions about people? Shouldn‚Äôt I have challenged my facebook friend? Shouldn‚Äôt I have asked her why she‚Äôs spreading propaganda? Couldn‚Äôt I have probed her to think critically about this man‚Äôs claims, about facts and ethics? 

No. I didn‚Äôt want to cause problems and I didn‚Äôt want to make waves.

The narrator of The Book Thief makes a claim that Hitler‚Äôs took over a country and started a war ‚Äì not with guns or weapons but with words. I‚Äôve read others consider this claim to be stupid and ridiculous but I actually agree with him. 

When I was a child I asked my Great Aunt Nell why she insisted on engaging me in long and tedious hypothetical debates about morality, human nature, ethics and theology. Her response was always the same: if you don‚Äôt fill a child‚Äôs head with all the right stuff, someone will come along and fill it with all the wrong stuff. It‚Äôs kind of like those corny motivational quotes that the teachers post in their rooms: Those who stand for nothing fall for anything.

Well, I agree. When you don‚Äôt educate people, when you don‚Äôt teach them to think critically, with full understanding and proper knowledge, then other people come along and whisper in their ear and fill their heads up with mindless rot. Hitler told the German people how to think. He told them who was Wrong. Why they were Wrong. How to fix the Wrong. What was Right. Then he did the most powerful thing a person could do: he told them a story. When you tell a whole nation a story about the future ‚Äì a gloriously bright future with Plenty and Joy; a future in which they are redeemed and have conquered their enemies; a future in which they are happy and Everything Is As It Should Be ‚Äì and if you tell that story well enough, then you can conquer a country and wage a war without ever firing a single bullet. 

Coincidently when you don‚Äôt speak up, when you don‚Äôt proclaim the truth, when you‚Äôre too afraid to replace ignorance with knowledge then you‚Äôre no better than an accomplice to a crime. I can‚Äôt imagine how my friends would feel if they‚Äôd known that I stood by and allowed them and their family and children to be slandered like that. Pretty appalled, I imagine ‚Äì and rightfully so.

And now we come to the big reason why I think a lot of people didn‚Äôt like this book ‚Äì the narrator.

The Hunger Games did a similar thing to The Book Thief. It sought to instil in its readers a sense of proper shame. However, as opposed to The Book Thief, you didn‚Äôt feel judged. After all, for the Sins that The Hunger Games was preaching of, we‚Äôre all guilty ‚Äì and in our combined guilt there seems to be a lessening of accountability. Perhaps there‚Äôs a sense that we‚Äôre all going down together. When we‚Äôre damned, at least we‚Äôll have good company, right? The Book Thief, however, singles you out as solely responsible. It strips you naked and looks down on you as it asks you to account of yourself. Not even the narrator can sympathize with you because he is the only one left blameless and innocent, looking upon us with a reserved kind of pity and bewilderment. 

Maybe I‚Äôm a glutton for punishment. I don‚Äôt mind being stripped down. I don‚Äôt mind being reprimanded and so I loved this book. I loved this book for inspiring me to be even more outlandishly outspoken and persistently and doggedly forthcoming on my opinions of these issues. I loved this book because I loved the narrator. I loved this book because I loved the story. 

I loved this book because I now have the PERFECT excuse to start a helluva lot more fights. 

For some reason, that thought makes me very happy."
896,Julie G,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jun 12, 2017",5,"This is my 400th book review for Goodreads. Wow. I am either one sick or one inspired woman (or both). 

Apparently when I reach my 500th review, Goodreads will put a little encouraging ""button"" on my profile (they might as well just give me a bookmark), but 400 feels big, too, so I wanted to review a book that I love but have never reviewed here.

The Time Traveler's Wife is a controversial novel, and when my book club discussed it, there were burning pitchforks, buckets of hot tar and glasses of Pinot Noir being splashed in faces. The room was like a parking lot after a football game between contentious rivals. It was awesome.

I give a HUGE amount of credit to the ladies of my book club. For 11 years they have suffered through having me, both a Lit teacher and a writer, as a member, and they have put up with A LOT of my empassioned opinions. When I don't like a book, I make it ABUNDANTLY clear why it sucks and when I love a book that others don't, I verbally knock them out of my way.

And I love this book. Boy howdy, do I love this book. I originally read it 11 years ago (then re-read it, and took a bunch of notes), and the characters and the plot just hopped on into the synapses of my brain, curled up there and have remained comfortably in that position, forevermore.

In my opinion, you can read this book for its surface value (as a romance or an adventure), or you can go deeper. This novel is loaded with metaphors, and you can get both Biblical here and/or follow the story with Homer's Odyssey by your side.

For Henry is a modern day Odysseus. He's a Christ-figure as well. He represents the spring, the adventurer, the one who is both sacrificed and reborn.

And his love, Clare, is both the archetypal mother and the wife, the perpetual autumn, and Penelope, the one who waits.

Niffenegger's plot point of time travel is immense. It serves here as a lush metaphor for the cycle of life: the living, the dying, the what comes after. And it doesn't hurt that Henry loves my kind of music, too.

The ladies of book club who passionately disliked this book cited several reasons. They complained that Niffenegger's style was not linear, they had a hard time following the plot, and they found Henry's relationship with Clare bordering on predatory or creepy. I acknowledge that they experienced these problems, but they just weren't an issue for me.

And the ending. . . my God. I cried to the point of embarrassment, even though I was home alone as I finished. I actually GASPED at the end, and my steadfast rule is. . . if a book makes me GASP, it automatically earns 5 stars. 

It is truly one of the best, most heart-breaking endings to a novel that I've ever encountered. My sweatshirt was soaked by the end and I ached and mourned and grieved all over those final pages.

I actually started to cry while writing this review, just revisiting that ending. A decade later. Damn! 

Good choice for my 400th review!"
897,Mer,The Giving Tree,"Apr 20, 2007",5,"Scrolling down, it seems several reviewers resent this book's apparently heavy-handed message about selfishness/selflessness. I can totally understand why they find it upsetting or sappy. Overbearing, even. But I don't agree.

Some fascinating theories have been put forth about The Giving Tree. It's deceptively simple on its surface, yes. But if this were truly just some hard and fast hippie dippy morality tale, would its two main characters (living natural tree, growing human boy) and their relationship have weathered such extensive interpretation over the years?

Professor Timothy Jackson from Stanford University (found on Wiki):

 Is this a sad tale? Well, it is sad in the same way that life is sad. We are all needy, and, if we are lucky and any good, we grow old using others and getting used up... Our finitude is not something to be regretted or despised, however; it is what makes giving (and receiving) possible. The more you blame the boy, the more you have to fault human existence. The more you blame the tree, the more you have to fault the very idea of parenting. Should the tree's giving be contingent on the boy's gratitude? If it were, if fathers and mothers waited on reciprocity before caring for their young, then we would all be doomed.

An admirable assessment from a theologian... although as a wee grub, my perception was different. My own folks, secular humanist scientists who taught me a ""recycle, reduce, reuse"" mantra at around age four, introduced me to The Giving Tree around the same time we started reading The Lorax. (Another seminal doozy!) Perhaps due to their influence on my early development, I came away from both books with a lot of very heavy, persistent questions concerning humanity's careless attitude towards ye olde Mother Earth. 

Without question, we're a species that generally takes and takes from the environment, thanklessly and thoughtlessly. Sadly this seems to be a trend that will continue until both we and the earth's resources are completely exhausted. (That is, unless we can all somehow convince ourselves AND our kids to turn it around.)

Ever notice that throughout the course of the tale, the little boy just ""wants"" things from the tree? Only at the very end of his life does he actually ""need"" something from her... a place to rest for a moment, to be at peace. 

Anyhoo. Aspects of human behavior introduced to me in this book continue to flummox and obsess me in adulthood. Rereading it now only reinforces my lifelong desire to give something back to our weary but still beautiful mother earth, who seems to have no choice but to submit to our endless taking.

Silverstein fable is empathetic and open-ended. At its core, it reflects humanity's short-sighted, often lifelong inability to distinguish want from need, but it does not damn us for it."
898,Nathan,The Giving Tree,"Jan 08, 2008",1,"I know that many people have a sentimental love for this book, and I respect that -- you can't rationalize emotional connection. And generally, I like this author. But with this book, since it inspired no real emotional response in me, I am left with only the rational perspective, which in me was this: 

This book troubles me deeply, because it enshrines self-destructive and self-pitying martyrdom as the paragon of love for others. And I think there is already far too much of this in our society. This book seems to say that if you really love someone else, you will damage yourself, cripple yourself, tear down your boundaries, destroy yourself for them. And further, it implies that those who are loved must by nature use and devour those who love them. An incredibly unhealthy model for love and relationships, especially for a child's book. 

I am a parent of two, and though many parents have offered up this book as representative of the true nature of parental love, I cannot agree. If I were to raise my children this way, I feel I would only be teaching them to take selfishly from those who love them, to use people up and always expect more -- and on the flip side, I would be teaching them that if they love someone then they have to give of themselves until it hurts, have to live without boundaries of any kind. 

Instead of raising my kids this way, I feel it's important to teach them to respect those who love them and care for them, to not take from others so much that it damages; I feel it's important to teach them that even in love we all must maintain our boundaries, our integrity. I feel it's important that my kids, and all kids really, understand that real, healthy love does not demand destruction or diminishment of anyone involved in it, that in fact real and healthy love ultimately heals and builds up those who participate in it. 

I suppose that this book may have been intended as an anti-lesson, an example of how NOT to behave -- but if so, then it was not made clear that this was the case, because most people who read this book seem to take it as an ideal example of love. 

Certainly it's possible to not take it so seriously; but when the underlying message and philosophy is so concentrated and heavy-handed, it's hard to avoid tasting it in every passage.

It reminds me of that other beloved childhood book about love, where the young boy's mother is so obsessive about cuddling him and tucking him in at night that even as he gets older and older, she follows him around, sneaks into his college dorm, sneaks into his home as an adult, takes him from his bed with his wife still sleeping and reassures him (herself?) that he'll ""always be my baby"". *shudder*

Overall: Sweet, but to the point of being cloying, and a disturbing message. =/"
899,Fernando,El se√±or de las moscas,"Aug 12, 2016",5,"Civilizaci√≥n y barbarie. ¬øCivilizaci√≥n o barbarie? ¬øCu√°n profunda es el alma humana? ¬øSomos todos tan malos? ¬øSomos buenos y en alg√∫n momento la vida hace aflorar lo m√°s perverso que est√° oculto en nuestros corazones? ¬øNacemos con una maldad adormecida y latente o las circunstancias de la vida nos transforman e inclinan hacia el mal? Este libro me ha hecho plantear estas preguntas. Me ha hecho pensar. En otras rese√±as, he comentado cu√°les fueron los libros que m√°s me han gustado y en este caso debo decir que en lo que va del a√±o, ""El Se√±or de las Moscas"" es el libro que m√°s me ha impactado (esa es la palabra).
Parece mentira que los personajes principales son tan s√≥lo ni√±os de entre 6 y 12 a√±os. Hasta parece inveros√≠mil, pero lo inveros√≠mil es algo que en la literatura se sale de su propio cauce, aunque la realidad aporta cuestiones similares.
Ya desde el principio, el autor nos mete de lleno en la trama argumental de la historia. William Golding no pierde tiempo en explicar la ca√≠da del avi√≥n, ni como se salvan los ni√±os y perecen todos los adultos sino que directamente nos muestra a unos ni√±os tratando de sobrevivir en una isla desierta de la forma m√°s visceral, tomando decisiones propias de los adultos y haci√©ndose hombres de golpe. 
Naturalmente y como en todo tipo de situaciones, aparecen los l√≠deres. Aquellas personas hechas para hacerse cargo de la situaci√≥n pero con formas totalmente antag√≥nicas para pensar y actuar en los momentos m√°s dif√≠ciles.
De esta manera conoceremos a los tres personajes principales del libro: Ralph, Jack y Piggy. Encontramos en Ralph una caracter√≠stica que sobresale claramente y que es la del sentido com√∫n. Toda decisi√≥n que pasa por sus manos es analizada fr√≠amente para buscar un bien que sea el mejor para todos. La idea de hacer una fogata y mantener el humo constante en el aire con la esperanza de que los vea un barco es simple en s√≠, pero es a la vez dif√≠cil de sostener en el tiempo.
Contar√° con √©l con Piggy. Ese muchacho gordito de amplias gafas cuyo principal emblema es la sensatez. De esta manera sus personalidades ofician de equilibrio ante los sucesos que vendr√°n y estar√°n los mellizos San y Eric, caracterizados por la fidelidad que le profesan a Ralph incluso hasta el final. 
En la contraparte de esta historia nos encontraremos con Jack, un muchacho impulsivo y agresivo, de esos que acostumbran a hacerse los guapos en el barrio. Tiene un instinto casi salvaje. Para √©l, lo √∫nico que interesa es cazar, matar, subsistir a base de lanzazos contra cuanto jabal√≠ se le cruce. Asar la carne y comerla de a dentelladas. Hasta eso llega su forma de vivir y eso es lo que exige de sus s√∫bditos (hay un punto que los otros muchachitos adquieren ese mote).
Lo secundar√°n con un fanatismo ciego Roger, un chico violento (tal vez m√°s que Jack) y Maurice, una especie de lugarteniente efectivo a la hora de los castigos.
En el libro, Golding utiliza ciertos elementos como simbolismos para tratar de mantener algo de ecuanimidad en una atm√≥sfera tan desbalanceada como la de esta isla desierta. La caracola es el elemento para expresarse y a su vez para escuchar al que tiene algo que decir y se transformar√° en un objeto del deseo. Todos querr√°n tener el control de este artefacto cuya funci√≥n principal es la comunicaci√≥n, pero pierde el sentido para el que se lo intent√≥ utilizar en un principio.
Otros elementos tiene otro objetivo como la fiera, del que yo intuyo representa el miedo que todos llevamos dentro. Todo aquello a lo que tememos y no podemos controlar. Al principio atemoriza a los peques de 6 a√±os y posteriormente, este miedo los alcanzar√° a todos.
Las posiciones de Ralph y Jack son completamente antag√≥nicas, enfrentadas, irreversibles y‚Ä¶ peligrosas. Tarde o temprano la situaci√≥n se ir√° desvirtuando. Todo se reduce a cazar o salvarse y el clima se pondr√° denso, pesado y sangriento.
Varias veces, se repite la frase ¬°Mata al jabal√≠! ¬°C√≥rtale el cuello! ¬°Derrama su sangre!, algo que considero totalmente de espanto...
El √∫ltimo de los elementos que regulan la vida de estos ni√±os es El Se√±or de las Moscas, simbolizada por esa cabeza de jabal√≠ clavada en una estaca. Este nombre es uno de los tantos que se utilizan para denominar al Diablo. Es la encarnaci√≥n del mal, una especie de t√≥tem infernal que infectar√° la mente de los ni√±os m√°s oscuros y ya no habr√° vuelta atr√°s.
Cuando estaba llegando a la √∫ltima parte del libro y ante las escenas finales que enfrentan a ambos bandos de ni√±os volv√≠ a reflexionar que eran seres humanos como yo, como el autor o como t√∫ lector que tambi√©n, si le√≠ste el libro puede que te hayas preguntado algo que yo s√≠ me pregunt√©: 
¬øSomos tan malos?"

901,Stephen,Pride and Prejudice,"Mar 16, 2010",5,"6.0 stars. Confession...this book gave me an earth-shattering Janeaustegasm and I am feeling a bit spent and vulnerable at the moment, so please bear with me. You see, I decided I wanted to get more literated by reading the ""classicals"" in between my steady flow of science fiction, mystery and horror. The question was where to begin.

After sherlocking through my Easton Press collection, I started by pulling out my Dickens and reading A Tale of Two Cities which I thought was jaw-dropping AMAZO and left me feeling warm, satisfied and content. It also made me made retrospectively pleased that I named my youngest daughter Sydney.

After Two City ‚ÄúTale‚Äùing, I decided to give this book a whirl as I kept seeing it on GR lists of ""goodest books ever."" However, I must admit I was hesitant going in to this for two big reasons. One, I thought it might be a bit too romantical for me. The second, and much more distressing, reason was that Twilight was on many of the same lists as this book. Austen fans should pull a nutty over that one.

So needless to say I went into this thinking I might hate it. Well, for the 999,987th time in my life (at least according to my wife‚Äôs records)...I was wrong!!! I absolutely loved this book and had a mammoth, raging heart-on for it from the opening scene at the breakfast table when Father Witty (Mr. Bennet) is giving sly sarcasm to Mrs. Mommie Put Upon. I literaphorically could not get enough of this story. I was instantly captivated by the characters and Elizabeth Bennet, the main protagonist, immediately became one of my all time favorite characters. Mr. Darcy joined that party as soon as he showed up in the narrative as I thought he was terrific as well.

Overall, the writing could not have been better. It was descriptive, lush and brilliant. The story could not have been more engaging or intelligent and the characters could not have been more magnificentastic. Elizabeth and Fitz are both smart, witty, self-confident and good. Austen could not have written them better. Oh, and I am sorry if this is a bit of a minor spoiler but I need to add that George Wickham is a cock-blocking braggadouche of startling proportions. I needed to say that and now I feel better. 

This one has made it onto my list of All Time Favorite novels and is truly one of the classics that lives up to its billing. A FINAL WORD TO THE GUYS: ...Guys, do not fear the Austen...embrace the Austen...HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!"
902,Anne,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Nov 15, 2008",4,"3.5 stars

Clever & witty, but not (to me) a laugh out loud sort of funny.
It is, however, an excellent little book about the absurdity of our place in the universe. And definitely worth reading at least once.

 

 The characters are all obnoxious and silly in the best way possible and so is the plot, but for the life of me, I can't think of a way to describe this thing without spoilers.
Psst - be nice to mice!

905,Lu√≠s,Dracula,"Jun 25, 2020",3,"I did not expect this reading style when I read, but I found the story made through diaries or letters exchanged enjoyably.
The idea at that time must have been very innovative because even today, I find it significantly developed in its concept and ingenious! And the strong presence of the solid Catholic belief of the time makes the story very realistic!
Even though I found some lengthy passages, I enjoyed discovering this world-famous book!"
906,Matthew,Gone With the Wind,"Mar 28, 2018",5,"Another epic story complete! This was a very good one!

I have read a few huge books in my life. Some are a struggle to get through and others are so captivating they read easier than a 300 page novel. Gone With The Wind falls in the ""captivating"" category. At no point was I bored with the story or wondering if it was ever going to end. I was fully invested every step of the way - invested to the point that my wife was amused that I spent a lot of time talking back to the book or exclaiming when something big or shocking happened. Gone With The Wind was the complete experience.

Before I go further, I will address the uncomfortable part of the book: the depiction of race, dialect, and other Civil War era activities in the South. At times I felt like maybe I shouldn't be enjoying a book featuring a sympathetic view of the South or feeling bad for those who struggled in their losses to the North. However, the story was really interesting and I have seen a lot of people from a wide variety of races give this book 5 stars, so I believe it is generally acceptable to enjoy it for what it is with an understanding of the time period it was written.

The writing: so great! How is it that Margaret Mitchell is only known for this book. I will have to look it up and see if she wrote any others. To write such a large book with a great story, symbolism, character development, etc. like this is pure genius.

The story: I had seen the movie but was not sure if I should expect it to be the same (seems like Hollywood used to stick closer to the source material than they do now.) From what I remember of the move, it is a pretty fair adaptation of the book. I thought the combination of fictional characters and events along side and intertwined with ones that actually occurred was very well done. Because of that I am sure this is a novel that historians enjoy as well.

The characters: Great character studies and development. Watching where everyone starts compared to where the finish was very interesting. It is not often you get to go along on what seems like an almost daily journey with the characters from youth through adulthood. None of these characters have it easy. Seeing how each character handles the struggles of drastic life changes is the heart and soul of this book.

Gone With The Wind lives up to its reputation as a classic. If you have the time for a 900+ page book, you really should check it out.

Side note: finished this while in Greenville, South Carolina - pretty close to Atlanta. Seems appropriate!"
907,Adina,Animal Farm,"Apr 06, 2014",5,"It is extraordinary how current this book is for the modern day Russian situation and not only. 

It left a powerful impression on me even if I knew all about the plot and message before starting the book. I thought (and I was right) that I should do some research before reading this book regarding the Russian Revolution, Stalin, Strosky in order to understand the historical context in which the book was written. 

I believe this book should be read by everybody as it is perfect allegory about the dangers of power, how socialist ideals are so easily corrupted and how dictators can transform into capitalists (I can think of some current examples). The most heartbreaking characters, the Horse Boxter represent the uneducated masses that are so easily fooled to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the leaders. That reminds me of all the brainwash that is done in the communist countries and not only."

On the bright side (by the way), it does not matter either. Earth too will no longer be, soon just billions of inconsequential floating pieces scattered throughout the cosmos, no one left to remember. The powers of the galaxy have decided this little insignificant, dull planet at the edge of the Milky Way must go. A byperspatial express route is being built, Earth is in the path no big deal to the rest of the universe, just a few souls disappear think of the convenience to others , people... His friend drops by, Mr.Ford Prefect and finds Arthur lying in the mud in front of the bulldozers, and asks him what's new ? And can he go to the local pub for a drink, they must talk... Seems okay to Dent, but first the intelligent man gets a gentleman's solemn sacred promise, from a bureaucrat (who shall remain nameless), that his house will still be standing when he gets back. Even has Mr.Prosser, replace him in the dirt (I can never keep a secret). After a few drinks which relaxes Arthur, Ford tell's his friend he's an alien from a another planet in the vicinity of the great star Betelgeuse, just 600 light-years away. Dent always thought Prefect was an eccentric man but this being England, perfectly permissible, goes on to explain he's a researcher for something called, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". A weird sound emulates from the outside disrupting this enlightening discussion, Arthur jumps up runs out the door and sees that there are no more gentlemen in the world now. Home gone, but the over excited man starts calling the wrecking crew unkind names. Such language (I will not repeat them, in mixed company, besides this is a family site ).

Ford arrives and the noise level rises also...A short time later the waking, Dent...Mr.Dent, comes to in the dark in an alien spaceship , one of those that vaporized his not quite beloved planet, with Ford there... Evil green, and very ugly aliens the Vogons who like to torture people by reciting bad poetry, I mean really bad Vogon poetry, resulting in captives welcoming death, rather than listen to another word... Captain Jeltz hates hitchhikers, and Ford had a devise to enter the ship, secretly.

In the year of our lord 20gayteen, it‚Äôs difficult to offer any sort of fresh or remotely nuanced critique on Twilight without resorting to edgelord tactics, like declaring that it‚Äôs a feminist read or that it was all an imaginary coping mechanism constructed by Bella to make returning to the shite little town of Forks bearable. But I think our judgement has been clouded for the past ten to twelve years - at least mine has, by the endless slew of stale ‚Äústill a better love story‚Äù memes and the constant personal jabs aimed at Stephenie Meyer by mainstream media. There‚Äôs also the YA scene‚Äôs insidious desire to erase all memory of it from genre history: when I was doing research for this review, I found¬†this video¬†in which multiple YA authors explain what their influences were for writing female-centric YA stories, and not one of them mentions Twilight, which‚Ä¶ Whoa. Like, that‚Äôs astounding to me. It's just disingenuous as fuck, that they had the gall to brazenly omit Stephenie Meyer from their credit lines, particularly when one or more of them started their careers in paranormal YA on the tail of the Twilight boom. Even this video, which claims to illustrate the history of¬†YA, downplays Twilight's¬†influence on the genre.¬†

YA existed before Twilight, of course, but it baffles me when the YA industry now slaps its hands to its ears and la-la-las over the indisputable truth: YA was a marginalised genre before the Twilight phenomenon. Was it a coincidence that YA paranormal romance exploded upon the rising popularity of Twilight? You could argue that it was, of course, and you‚Äôre entitled to your wrong opinion, but I did not unironically Google ‚ÄúEdward Cullen star sign‚Äù for you hoes to come at me with ‚Äúwhat about Catcher in the Rye‚Äù. Fuck Catcher in the Rye. I‚Äôm not explaining that opinion any further and not will I defend it. Fuck that book and fuck all of its smug knock-offs, because if you polish a turd it‚Äôs still a turd. I'm sorry, but I don't make the rules. 
¬†
The basic breakdown is this: I enjoyed this book, and I mean I genuinely enjoyed it, and was invested, until about the halfway mark. After that, it was impossible for me to ignore the cloying creepiness that perverts a sweet and tender love story into something that, as an adult, is difficult for me to justify. When I was 13, I was a stan for Twilight, but not because of the books - I had only seen the movies, and for this reason it feels like a missed opportunity, because I can‚Äôt accurately compare my feelings then to my feelings now. This inaccuracy stems mostly from the fact that the movies were a farce that in no way capture the spirit of the characters or any of the relationships between them. It‚Äôs because of the movies that this series is the focus of such intense ridicule and hatred in the media; it‚Äôs the self-seriousness of the movies that‚Äôs so infuriating, because while the book is melodramatic and depressing, it‚Äôs light and jubilant where the movie isn‚Äôt. My main problem with the media‚Äôs perception of the series is that it‚Äôs based entirely on this self-seriousness, and in particular Kristen Stewart‚Äôs dead eyes. 

The truth is that Book Bella and Movie Bella are two starkly different people, and you can fucking fight me on this. It doesn‚Äôt surprise me that Stephenie Meyer is over it and has Moved On,¬†because if I was her, I would genuinely be bitter as fuck, the most poisonous bitch, an actual¬†Vi·π£akanyƒÅ, not only for the unstoppable barrage of media abuse but also for the forced image of my creative work as something completely separate from what it is.¬†

Meyer has weathered a barrage of criticism for her Mormon lifestyle, and this has bled into her storytelling, and to an extent I agree, because heavy-handed morality is an easy way to drop a story down a U-bend. However, while Meyer‚Äôs inherent religious biases have centred heteronormativity and gender-based parameters, it may run deeper than this. The artery of conflict that threads through each book in the series is opposing ideals within the central relationship, and if we look at these characters as theological models, their connection does boast a bit more nuance: Edward is Mormonism and Bella is modernism, thus their relationship is a wrestle between starkly defined historical values and modern flexibility.¬†



To explore this model, it's worth analysing each character as an individual, not both as a unit (we'll get to that later). My impression of Bella is that she's confident in familiar situations and, contrary to common criticism, mostly generated from the appallingly weak and lifeless character in the movies, is not defined by low self-esteem. When several boys ask her out to the dance she never defaults to this modest cry of, ‚Äúwho, me?‚Äù; she‚Äôs weary of the attention, and shrugs off her pursuers by diverting their romantic efforts to her single friends (with whom she shares close, if superficial bonds, to be expected from people who haven't had much time to get to know each other outside of school). She never shrinks away from male attention, and while she does often acknowledge that Edward is aesthetically pleasing, her reaction to being seen with a ""dazzling"" and notorious man is a natural one: ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt people wonder why someone so special is out with someone so ordinary, like me?‚Äù This is not a new or particularly groundbreaking question to ask oneself, especially in young and emotionally charged relationships, and especially with someone like Bella, who is defined by her low-key and utilitarian outlook, and her discomfort with an excess of attention in social circles.¬†

Bella mentions that she was not popular in Arizona, but for defined reasons: She is not sporty or excessively outgoing, which the book lays out as defining traits of most Arizonans (as a non-American, I‚Äôm unable to confirm this as truth or condemn it as a false stereotype, but the author does live in Arizona). She also states that her last school was densely populated which, naturally, provides an ease of anonymity. Her move to Forks batters her with the scrutiny of the tight-knit community, due for the most part to her mother‚Äôs vaguely sordid reputation as ‚Äúthe Chief‚Äôs flighty ex-wife‚Äù (12), the Chief being Charlie, a trusted pillar of the community. Ren√©e‚Äôs notoriety as an ex-Forks resident, an elusive outsider who left the town in her dust - an uncommon novelty - marks her as a kind of traitor to the community, and by extension, Bella shares this burden. Even without considering her mother‚Äôs impact on Forks‚Äô social circle, Bella invites attention as a rare new face among a close circle of scandal-starved teens.¬†

Again and again, Bella is verbally lashed for a lack of personality or strong voice, but while Bella‚Äôs narration is introspective, this doesn‚Äôt strip her of personality (I mean it; this criticism is repeated ad nauseam). She‚Äôs a quiet, orderly girl who respects authority and values her studies, as much a clich√© of its time as the ‚Äústrong female protagonist‚Äù that has haunted YA for the past six years and has launched an oftentimes distasteful attack on traditional femininity, creating a dichotomy between ‚Äústrong girl‚Äù and ‚Äúweak girl"". 

But Bella can‚Äôt be neatly categorized with her knock-offs: she forfeited her happy, sunny life in Arizona for her mother‚Äôs benefit, a notably selfless choice, and not a courtesy that her mother necessarily deserves. Ren√©e's neglectful parenting is often brushed aside as she hounds Bella via email and phone, creating an unsavoury illusion of parental concern. In reality, Ren√©e is immature and self-involved, leaving bills unpaid and the fridge bare, darting off to pursue an unsustainable life on the road while she has a dependent minor at home. This is commented on in a particularly telling passage wherein Bella is concerned about leaving her ‚Äúerratic, harebrained mother‚Äù (4) to fend for herself: ‚ÄúOf course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost‚Äù (4). It's a troubling role reversal that plays out in a similar, albeit softer, fashion when Bella moves in with her father and is immediately forced to take on basic duties in the home, due to her father‚Äôs ineptitude in the kitchen and in homemaking.¬†

But Bella is an independent girl who doesn‚Äôt want to shoehorn her mother into the same situation that she fled in Forks, so she moves away to stay with her father purely for Ren√©e‚Äôs benefit. But her relationship with Charlie is tender: when Tyler‚Äôs truck nearly crushes her, she‚Äôs thinking fondly of her father, who got up early to put snow chains on the wheels of her truck. It‚Äôs the same sort of quiet thoughtfulness that defines Bella. When people like Jacob and Angela are being sidelined by their friends - ignored during a group conversation - Bella notices this and acknowledges them. Bella‚Äôs personality is quiet, but I wouldn't call it weak. (It's worth remembering that, in 2005, a ""ladylike front"" was very much in fashion and not only in religious circles like Meyer's. This ""touch my butt and buy me pizza"" attitude didn't come into fashion until Tumblr became mainstream, and until the internet popularised the Anna Kendrick brand. You know, this ""I'm a gross girl and I wear sweatpants and I like to swear"". That mentality wasn't part of the media hive mind yet.)

Is this what catches Edward‚Äôs attention? In part, yes. Though more prominently it‚Äôs Bella‚Äôs mystery that attracts Edward. He can‚Äôt read her mind, thus their courtship requires rituals, wooing, a thrill that is missing entirely from Edward‚Äôs life. I mentioned in my status updates that I had a lot of feelings about Edward, his past and his pain, and to an extent I do; it‚Äôs another missed opportunity, because Edward‚Äôs past is handwaved, even though it influences every facet of his questionable behaviour, from his total lack of awareness about road safety, to his absurd and oftentimes bewildering fascination with Bella‚Äôs average life.¬†

Here‚Äôs the thing about Edward: he‚Äôs either too old or too young, depending on how you look at it. He was born on the cusp of living memory, which means that in 2005, he‚Äôs the same age as some people‚Äôs great grandparents, and this is what makes his relationship with Bella unacceptable. He‚Äôs not a relic, like Carlisle, or merely an older man. He is geriatric, and this adds an element of unavoidable perversion to his romance with a teenage girl.¬†With a clear mind, it‚Äôs almost impossible not to recoil when Edward describes Bella as ‚Äúappallingly luscious‚Äù or during this exchange: 

‚Äú‚ÄòThat‚Äôs probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.‚Äô
I brindled a little at the word child. ‚ÄòJacob is not that much younger than I am,‚Äô I reminded him.
He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. ‚ÄòOh, I know,‚Äô he assured me with a grin.‚Äù (305)

If we look at this from Carlisle‚Äôs point of view, then it becomes apparent that Edward‚Äôs age was a huge narrative blunder. Carlisle is 362, and if we sit back and contemplate the enormity of that, and the sheer gulf between him and someone who is seventeen, then it almost wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if Edward were also old as balls: he could be considered something other entirely, not an elderly man but a creature from another world, wholly divorced from Bella‚Äôs insular world. It would be as if she had fallen in love with an alien, or some eldritch beast from a parallel universe. It would require a lot more effort on Meyer's part to explain exactly what it is that makes their relationship hold together, and the politics between them would be more complex, but this would arguably have made for a more cerebral read. (Conversely, this is why I struggle to fully get on board with Outlander. Granted, I've only seen the TV show, but how could Claire and Jamie possibly find anything to talk about that's remotely relevant to either of their lives? He's never seen a bean can and he doesn't know what the telly is.) But ageing Edward up could, with some moral gymnastics and a constant reminder that Yes, This Is Weird, But We‚Äôre Going With It, remove him from Bella‚Äôs socio-political sphere just enough that it would almost be more acceptable.

It's the poor decision to time Edward's birth at the beginning of the 20th century that really hits the nail into the coffin here. While it does comfortably serve the theological dichotomy between Edward and Bella (anyone significantly older would probably not be Mormon, as Mormonism wasn't a thing until the early-to-mid 1800s) it is a stumbling block for the believability of the romance. The movie and the book both struggle desperately to reconcile Edward‚Äôs point of view with Bella‚Äôs, neither one with enough sleight of hand to properly explore the intricacies of it; that said, at least in the book, Edward is fun:

‚Äú‚ÄòYou scared me for a minute there,‚Äô [Edward] admitted after a pause‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòI thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.‚Äô
‚ÄòHa, ha.‚Äô I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute. 
‚ÄòHonestly‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen corpses with better colour. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.‚Äô
‚ÄòPoor Mike. I bet he‚Äôs mad.‚Äô
‚ÄòHe absolutely loathes me,‚Äô Edward said cheerfully.‚Äù (85)

In the movie, it‚Äôs impossible to understand why the hell this old man is chasing after this little girl, but in the book he‚Äôs charming and eloquent, and there are instances that beget genuine empathy‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about Edward‚Äôs total disregard for his own personal safety, his exclusion from society, this insular environment that Carlisle‚Äôs bite condemned him to. He is an old man caged in the body of a teenager, and his family only enables his self-destructive behaviour. I wouldn‚Äôt even call him a pervert: I would call him someone who is so psychologically damaged from a physical assault that he is clawing desperately to human affection to try to manufacture a sense of normalcy in his life. And Carlisle, his attacker, is now his sole benefactor, the puppeteer of a collection of ageless marionettes that obey his authority over their household. They survive at Carlisle‚Äôs pleasure; they play by his rules. But Edward states that the vampires do not sleep, and while sleep is necessary for growth and repair, it‚Äôs also vital for mental health. What has this created in Carlisle, a man who hasn‚Äôt slept in around 340 years? Is there any way to measure the psychological damage this could cause, or are we seeing it now in this strange, macabre puppet show that is the Cullen clan?

Is this an intentional angle? It‚Äôs hard to say. I doubt it, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs such a thing as ‚Äúreading too much‚Äù into stories, especially those that deal with extremely weighty topics such as immortality and love and pack mentality. What strikes me most here is that Bella is a victim of the Cullen clan, but so is Edward, and of course Rosalie. Edward, Rosalie, and Esme were all turned by Carlisle without their consent, and while they all were dying, and though this is passed off as noble by Carlisle, it doesn‚Äôt ring true.¬†

As asserted by the narrative, the ‚Äúlawless‚Äù vampires, i.e. those who do not belong to a ""safe"" clan and who are not under the control of any other entity, and who hunt humans, are the villains of this story, but what makes them villainous is their disregard for human life, and that they justify this by citing their natural instincts. The vampires‚Äô natural attractiveness, their smell, and their heightened senses all function for ease of hunting, and the Cullens are not exempt; the difference between them is that the ungoverned vampires hunt humans, and the Cullens do not.¬†

Or do they?

Perhaps what Carlisle did can‚Äôt be labelled ‚Äúhunting‚Äù, but it could be something worse. It could be the ultimate act of power and control, to stockpile living bodies, to use acts of brutality and violence to manufacture close familial bonds. Carlisle professes not to have given in to his baser instincts, but the truth may be that he did, not by killing but with a cultivated community of psychological torture. Edward states that Carlisle was lonely, but the problematic element to this is that Carlisle knew why he was lonely - it was because immortality made him that way. His solution to this was to condemn other people to the same fate. One could ask why Carlisle was so certain that the other ‚ÄúCullens‚Äù would bond with him, but my answer to this is that Carlisle made it that way: this was his design, to collect a trove of ghosts and lock them behind the doors of his estate. 

The Cullens will always be connected by the things that make them ‚Äúother‚Äù, and in the end, so will Bella. She will become a Cullen too, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not Edward‚Äôs fingers that are plucking her puppet strings.¬†

Is James the villain here? Perhaps. Perhaps not.¬†

913,Bradley,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Apr 10, 2013",5,"Re-Read 4/2/22:

Read this book for the first time with my daughter. I figured it is a piece of culture and I'm nothing if not a man of culture. Plus, the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys.

Out of almost all of the hilarious things in this book, my daughter was supremely taken by:

""You want me,"" said Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, ""to come and lie over there...""
""Yes.""
""In front of the bulldozer?""
""Yes.""
""Instead of Mr. Dent?""
""Yes.""
""In the mud.""
""In, as you say, the mud.""


We have, in point of fact, put towels on our heads and acted out the scene more than a few times. Not 42 times, however. There are only so many hours in the day.

I think it was a hit. But we must always remember... Don't Panic.


Original Review:

I'm a firm believer that every budding reader ought to read this book first so they can be utterly and completely ruined for literature for the rest of their lives.

Of course, if you're an older reader, with experience and verve when it comes to words, you might also be completely ruined for literature for the rest of your life, too, but I'm not counting you. In fact, I don't care about you. 

I have a towel.

And I know how to USE IT. It's almost, but not quite entirely unlike having a clue.


Fortunately, I, myself had been totally ruined for literature early on in my life and I think I might have read this book around seven or eight times before I got the idea that nothing else I would ever read would quite stack up to it, and afterward, I just decided to become Marvin and assume that the whole world was not quite worth living.

But, again, fortunately, I remembered that I was an Earthling and I could replace most of my cognitive centers with ""What?"" and get along quite nicely. So that's what I did and ever since I've been reading normal books and saying ""What?"" quite happily.

You SEE? Happy endings DO happen. As long as you're not a pot of Petunias. Of course, that story would take WAY too long to tell.

I think I want to grab a bite to eat. Maybe I ought to meet the meat."
914,Lisa,Fahrenheit 451,"Jun 25, 2014",4,"The Wall Controls You - The Silent Take-Over Of Screen-Time!
 
What does ""Fahrenheit 451"" mean to me? Most of all, it is a declaration of love for books in an era of fast entertainment and instant gratification as a means of political control of the masses.

I used to think Brave New World and 1984 - or a combination of those two - had a more accurate take on human mind-slavery in the age of technology than ""Fahrenheit 451"". But increasingly, I see the world as Bradbury saw it, with people sitting in front of screens, absorbed by meaningless entertainment without purpose or fulfillment, losing their ability to talk to each other. And with the dialogue, reflection disappears from our homes and schools. 

Students do ""research"" without ever touching a book and spit out slogans they find online, but they can't put them into context. They write their essays on screens and unlearn how to spell. They dream of a career which makes them visible on screens as well: they want to be athletes, singers, movie stars. Out of the 200 teenagers I asked, only 2 had read a book during their ten weeks of summer holidays, and most of them couldn't even say what they had been doing instead. Time passes without being noticed in front of a screen - a WALL, as it is called in the novel.

If you do not practice the skill of reading and of appreciating literature, it is lost. The book burning that takes place in ""Fahrenheit 451"" is not even necessary in the real world of today. Those rare students that like reading can't share their interest with anyone anymore, and it doesn't spread:

""With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word 'intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be.""

What Bradbury meant as satire is my work reality.

So what have I done myself, hopeless book lover that I am? I have taken to the woods, figuratively speaking, like the characters in ""Fahrenheit 451"". Barring television screens and computer games - the walls - from my home, I have made sure reading stays alive. My walls are filled with books, not screens. I waste no opportunity to talk about books with my children, and I make them learn poems by heart. To develop a lasting love for literature, it has to be nurtured. You are not born a reader, just like you are not born a football player or a dancer. Accessibility, motivation and training are necessary prerequisites for any interests to form. It takes time and care.

Fahrenheit 451 - the temperature at which books burn. I think Bradbury got that wrong. It is what happened to books in the past, when politicians actively tried to destroy specific books. There is no need for them to do that anymore. In our world, books drown - in the flood of quick information and easy entertainment.

The year of the flood... after the fire came the water, and it caused more damage!"
915,Bill Kerwin,The Alchemist,"Jan 08, 2015",1,"A good parable--like ""The Prodigal Son""--should comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. The problem with this little book is that it does precisely the opposite.

Coelho's message--and, boy, is this a book with a message--is that each of us has his own Personal Legend, and that if we recognize that legend and pursue it sincerely, everything in the Universe (which is after all made up--wind, stone, trees--of the same stuff we are) will conspire to help us achieve it. Corollaries: 1) people who don't recognize their legends are never happy, 2) people who fail to realize their legends are afraid, and 3) people who refuse to pursue their legends, even when they know what they are, are both unhappy and afraid. (I admit I've left out a nuance or two here and there, but not many. There aren't more than three or four nuances in the book.)

I fear that the result of taking such a message seriously will be to make the successful even more self-satisfied, the narcissistic more self-absorbed, and the affluent more self-congratulatory. At the same time, those who are unfortunate will blame themselves for their bad fortune, those who lack self-esteem will lose what little they have, and the poor will see--no, not God, as the beatitude says, but--the poor will see they have only themselves to blame.

Perhaps I am being too harsh. I can see how a few individual young persons, hemmed in by parental expectations and seeking their own paths, may find enough hope and courage here to help them venture forth. But I am convinced the damage done by books like this--like The Secret, The Celestine Prophecy, and anything ever written by the late Dr. Wayne Dyer (or, for that matter, anything he may ever choose to channel from beyond the grave)--is far greater than the little good they may achieve.

If you like parables, don't read this book. Go read a book of Hasidic tales collected by Martin Buber, a book of Sufi stories collected by Idries Shah, or a book of parables and sayings by Anthony de Mello instead.

Or then again, you could just try Jesus. Jesus is always good."
916,Jason,The Great Gatsby,"Jul 09, 2007",5,"Most Americans are assigned to read this novel in high school. Few American high schoolers have the wherewithal to appreciate this novel in full. I certainly did not. It is on a shortlist of novels that should, every 5 years starting at age 25, return to any American's required reading list.

First things first: The opening of The Great Gatsby -- its first 3-4 pages -- ranks among the best of any novel in the English language, and so too does its ending. Both for their content and for their prose, the latter of which is stunning and near perfect throughout the novel.

As for that between the novel's opening and conclusion, two things first. (1) History is fairly clear that the term ""the American Dream"" did not exist at the time Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby, and regardless it almost certainly did not exist in the popular consciousness. (2) Few great American novelists after Fitzgerald have not attempted to write ""the great American novel"". Most of these efforts are absurdly long and often tortured. The Great Gatsby, on the other hand, is relatively short, fluid, and of seemingly effortless yet pristine expression. At a point in history where Fitzgerald's express focus could hardly have been a tale regarding ""the American dream"" per se or the writing of ""the great American novel"", Fitzgerald nevertheless crafts the definitive tale of ""the American Dream"", as well as, his successors' endeavors aside, ""the great American novel"". Period.

In not so many pages, Fitzgerald paints a brilliantly cogent picture of the potential pleasures, joys, and benefits an individual might deem achievable -- uniquely so -- in an America filled with possibilities. Paired with that picture, Fitzgerald besprinkles The Great Gatsby with the numerous pitfalls and evils that both stand as a barrier to what's imagined achievable in America, and threaten to accompany that which is achieved. Neither the quest for, nor (if possible) the achievement of, the American Dream is a thing untainted. Nor, in Fitzgerald's view, can it be.

Fitzgerald, frankly, writes all that need be written on this subject; whatever his successors' ambitions may be. And he writes it in prose so perfect, so impressive, and so beautiful, I occasionally find myself at a loss to name a novel in the English language constructed with greater skill, and apparent ease thereof.

In short: The Great Gatsby is an inimitable wonder of American fiction. And, for lack of a better word, an ""application"" of the English language that has few equals. The novel is astounding."
917,Matthew,Dracula,"Nov 15, 2017",3,"Two things about this book:

1. It is a really great and creepy story that deserves classic status
2. Everything is repeated soooooo much without any obvious benefit.

Here is actual footage of Bram Stoker writing this novel:



If Stoker had just got to the point, this book would have been much more exciting and suspenseful. I understand the exact same mysterious thing happens night after night. I understand that Dracula has some boxes of dirt. I get that you brought Winchester rifles along for protection. Each of these things was repeated ad nauseam throughout the book. Talk about killing the pace - by the time the gruesome scares came I was very disengaged. 

Also, funny thing about this book as a horror story - it must be the grandfather of heading up the stairs to hide instead of running outside or cutting through the graveyard shortly after hearing a serial killer is loose. They keep leaving people alone even though those people are repeatedly attacked when they are left alone. Then, when they finally insist on guarding someone, that person insists that they need no one but God to guard them!? Seems like so far God had not been interested in protecting, so why count on him starting now!?

So three stars because it is a classic and I like the story. I especially like Lucy's suitors - their gung ho manliness amuses me. But the repetition and the illogical behavior in the face of a bloodsucking monster are the cause of the removal of a couple of stars."
918,Alejandro,The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition,"Dec 10, 2017",5,"Curiouser and curiouser edition!



This is the annotated edition, collecting both novels in the Alice book series: ‚ÄúAlice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland‚Äù and ‚ÄúThrough the Looking-Glass and What Alice found There‚Äù.



WE‚ÄôRE ALL MAD HERE



Begin at the beginning‚Ä¶


This was technically a re-reading since I‚Äôve already read both novels previously, the key difference here was that this is an ‚Äúannotated‚Äù edition, which includes a comprehensive section, at the end of each chapter, with tons of notes revealing ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes‚Äù detailing moments in the life of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll), the ‚Äúreal‚Äù meaning of scenes, the ‚Äúreal‚Äù inspirations for several of the characters in both novels, historic meaning (in the Victorian England) of casual expressions that got outdated nowadays, studies in the metrics of the poems included in the novels, etc‚Ä¶


I don‚Äôt think‚Ä¶



Then you shouldn‚Äôt talk‚Ä¶


It was a curiouser and curiouser reading experience since this was my first ‚Äúannotated edition‚Äù of any book, and I believe that if you want to engage into this sort of books, it‚Äôs advisable having read the regular version of the novel first, since reading all those annotations after each chapter, it‚Äôs a kinda of ‚Äúbraking‚Äù effect, since depending the chapter, you‚Äôll invest almost the same time reading the explanations than the chapter itself, so you lose a great deal of the rhythm of your reading, therefore, if you haven‚Äôt read the story before, you may not enjoying as much as it was supposed to be.


It‚Äôs a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.


Of course, almost all the information was made by scholars in the Lewis Carroll‚Äôs works, doing assumptions and best guesses, since the author was already gone when this annotated edition began to be conceived. Therefore, it‚Äôs a priceless access to get a better understanding of the novels at the era when they were published, BUT‚Ä¶


‚Ä¶sometimes I‚Äôve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.


‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt fully take without a doubt the exposed explanations, since you can‚Äôt ask the author anymore to validate if their interpretations are truly accurate. So, as many things in life, it‚Äôs up to you if you wish to believe them.


I can‚Äôt go back to yesterday because I was a different person then.


And as those scholars mentioned at some momento of the annotations, that sometimes we are so obssessed to find a secret meaning behind any single quote, any single character, any single scene, etc‚Ä¶ and while it‚Äôs evident that some quotes, characters and scenes have indeed a double significance, some of them are merely things needed to keep flowing the narrative, as simply as that, without any conspiration or secret plot,‚Ä¶


I‚Äôm not strange, weird, off, nor crazy, my reality is just different from yours.


‚Ä¶so don‚Äôt get too deep into the annotations section and simply enjoy this wonderfully mad tale about a little girl who fell down into a rabbit‚Äôs hole and she kept finding curiouser and curiouser things, even through the looking-glass.


‚Ä¶and go on till you come to the end: then stop."
919,MizzSandie,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Jun 30, 2011",1,"DISCLAIMER:


I did not like this book. 

I am about to try to explain why that is so, here, in my own, personal review space. I am critiqing this book, based on my own opinions, personal taste, experiences and perspective, criteria and standards for literary work. It is entirely subjective, as I think all reviews, per definition, are.

I mean no disrespect to the people who like this book, and who have found in it something of value. You are as entitled to your own opinion, subjective readingexperience, and standards, as I am, and yours is just as valid. And you have the same opportunity as me, to use your own review space, to clarify that. We don‚Äôt all have to agree. One opinion isn‚Äôt ‚Äòwrong‚Äô and the other ‚Äòright‚Äô ‚Äì they are both right, personally speaking, because it is subjective.
If you are a big fan of this book, and have difficulty in understanding or respecting people, who disagree with you, especially on issues that are important to you, I advice you not to read any further. I will not be saying nice things about this book.

I want to underline that I look at Charlie as a written character, not a real person, and I critique the book as a literary piece of work, not as a real life story. To me, there is a huge difference between the two.
------------------------------

Some of the things that matter most to me in books are prose/writing style, storytelling and message. It‚Äôs one of the things that can make or break a book for me.
In this case, the writing  style  just didn't work for me.
It was just too  lacking .
Maybe it's the whole premise of the book, a story narrated by someone who is emotionally inhibited as Charlie, that didn't work for me? Maybe, but it didn't have to be. That issue and Charlie‚Äôs character could have been explored and dealt with, literary, in other ways.
The book could have had Charlie‚Äôs narration interact with someone else‚Äôs (like an answer to the letters for example), or it could have been written in the 3rd person, maintaining Charlie‚Äôs point of view, but also being able to draw in other views, and how they collide with Charlie‚Äôs.

I find it a bit concerning, that Chbosky wrote a book with so many serious issues like suicide, death, rape, social exclusion/inclusion, relationship violence, abortion, drugs, homosexual adventures, childmolestation/incest, parties, fights, without really dealing with any one of them in depth. To have all of these issues crammed into one book, without giving it the time and place it deserves, I felt, was a huge fault. Each one of these issues needs to be taken seriously, not pointed out on one page, just to be forgotten on the next. If you are going to write about these things, write about it well, give it the space and the in-depth exploration it deserves. To make the reader care for these characters, for these issues, the author and the characters involved must care too. I had a hard time stomaching that both Chbosky and the characters seemed to care so little, for something that is so very very real and so very very difficult, for so many people. It was almost making a mockery of them, which was very off-putting to me.
The staccato writing and Charlie‚Äôs detached narrating, made me feel detached as well.
The story is written in a very plain, very dull, very simple language, with the same sentences reoccurring over and over (eg.  ""..I don't know why.."" , ""He/she looked sad."")
The emotional description amounts to 'sad' or 'happy'.

The portrayals of Charlie and everyone else in the story was so lacking that they felt like cardboard cutouts and simply came off as what they were; made up characters in a fictional story (and not a very good one at that if you ask me).

The main character, Charlie, is 15, but comes off as much younger than that. Again, I would have wished for some more in-depth exploration of why and what is the basis of this, to better be able to understand and relate to Charlie‚Äôs character. 

Charlie also cries a lot, which wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, if it was more nuancedly described. I don‚Äôt want to see /read about just the surface tears. I want to be taken behind the tears, into the pool they stem from, the pain they are a symptom of and maybe a release from? I want the author to show me what these tears mean, I want to understand them, to be touched by them, to be moved with the ebb and flow of them. In this case, that didn‚Äôt happen. 
The sentence  ""I/he/she started to cry""  alone, just doesn‚Äôt stir much emotion in me. Especially not when thrown about on every other page. Then it just gets bothersome and tiring.
It's not that I have an aversion to tears (my own or others'). Crying is normal, and can be very healthy and soothing. 
But when it comes to a literary work, I expect the author to give more nuanced descriptions of feelings than just bucketful of tears. Okay, so they are sad. Very, very sad. Very often. Now, show me what that sadness does to someone, besides producing tears, tears, tears. I am not interested in the tears alone. The sadness is the root, the tears are a symptom. Many people are filled with sadness, but don‚Äôt produce many tears. Sadness can overflow in many ways. So: the sadness is the key. 
Which is why I was so disappointed that Chbosky never digged deeper than this very very thin surface. All I got was tears. And I wonder if all the crying came down to Chbosky simply not knowing how else to describe emotions, or how explore them.

Much thought and debate has been given to the question why Charlie is, the way he is. 
There is the fact that he suffered from childhood trauma, and then there is the question of whether or not Charlie might be autistic. The latter is hinted at and up for interpretation, but never explicitly stated/diagnosed.
The autistic spectrum is a varied one, and it comes in many forms, very few fitting the standard, but classic ‚Äòrainman‚Äô syndrome of a very intelligent but socially closed off person. It‚Äôs admirable to want to write about autism, a difficult diagnosis to live with, sure. I just don‚Äôt think Chbosky is doing autistic people any favors or justice with his depiction of Charlie as someone who might or might not be autistic.
Again I must say: if you are going to write about it, write about it with care. Don‚Äôt make it into a guessing game, but own it. Don‚Äôt glamorize or deride it, but show its many layers and nuances through the particulars and the concrete. 
The same goes for the psychological trauma. It wasn‚Äôt given the care and attention it deserved. It was left at the end as an easy way out, like 'hey, he suffered/suffers from this and so i'm excused for writing a terribly boring book'.
No.
Whatever made Charlie the way he is, it doesn‚Äôt compensate for how the story was written and pulled off.
To me, it's really besides the point, since I don‚Äôt base my rating/review on pity for a character.

SO whether Charlie has any form of autism or not, doesn't really matter, because I thought he and the story was very poorly written. 
and let me be clear about this: 
It's not the  disorder I have a problem with, it's the writing  of it.

Note (November, 2013): I recently saw the movie, and thought it was better than the book.
Maybe because it fixed some of the issues I had with the book, like it left some of the drama llama out and it wasn't as heavily centered on Charlie's narration and perspective, and emotions and reactions was expressed through expressions instead of just (bad) writing. Different type of media - different possibilities. For this story, i think movie worked better than writing."
920,Kristy,1984,"Sep 04, 2009",1,"Praise the lord and pass the amunition, I am finished with this beast of a book. My brain feels like sludge, I just want to crawl into a hole and forget all that was engrained into my poor head. Why, oh why did I have the noble idea to read such a monster? How am I supposed to rate such s#@$????? 
I believe, like some of you that this might have been better had I read it in a class or with a group. Alone it was fingernails to chalkboard miserable.

After reading this, it just makes you feel hopeless. 

Hallelujah, it's over. Never again, Orwell.... Never again!

Sidenote: I did a little experiment on facebook about this book... I wrote in my status that I was reading '1984', anybody have any opinions? Almost everyone of the commenters wrote how much they enjoyed this book and how it was one of their favorite books ever. While I am sure that maybe 1 of them was being truthful, I have to doubt atleast half of them..... Now I ask, Why do people lie about certain books? Do they think it makes them look smarter? Cooler? Well-rounded? I just don't get it, if you don't like something you don't like it. It's not neccessary to like it for classic book sake. This might not be making sense to some of you.... maybe you would have to know the people who were commenting, I don't know. But, I am sure all of you have been in a bookstore or talking with a co-worker, etc., and they spout out some well known ""hip"" book that they just 'adore'. You know this person and it's hard to see them reading period, much less what they are talking about.

I guess my point is, don't be a fake book talker. Like it, Yay. Don't like it, Yay. I'm not going to think less of you for not liking something you ""SHOULD"" like by literary standards.

Rant over."

922,Peter,Fahrenheit 451,"May 02, 2019",5,"An absolute anti-utopian classic of the 20th century. I did a speech about that book in class (in 1988 I guess) to convince the other pupils how important this books is. The temperature at which books burn. No slowdown, only highspeed on the streets, reality shows at home with you being part of it, a world dominated by a government given truth. What happens if someone dares to look behind the scenes? Dares to read a uncensored book? Who is this group trying to find the truth beyond the fact falsifying system of the government? This is a must read. Ray Bradbury had a look into our modern times when he wrote this groundbraking classic. One of the best books of the 20th century!"
923,Scoobs,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Oct 02, 2007",5,"Oh Dorian. Oh Dorian.

When I first read this book in the fruitless years of my youth I was excited, overwhelmed and a blank slate (as Dorian is, upon his first encounter with Lord Henry) easily molded, persuaded, influenced, etc.

Certain Wildisms (Wildeisms?) would take my breath away. Would become my mottos to believe in. To follow. To live.

Lines like:

""It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.""

""But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.""

""If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.""

""Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.""

""You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.""

Re-reading this masterpiece and coming upon these highlighted lines was possibly more interesting than the book this time. Why had I highlighted these lines? Do they still mean the same thing to me, as they did when I first took note of them, enough to highlight them? I still love all of those lines. But no longer feel so strongly for them.

Now these are lines that stick out still to me. Or were newly underlined on the second pass through. New Wildisms to mold me.

""Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely I never tell their names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvelous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one's life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?""

""Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty.""

""Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one.""

""I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects.""

""Ah! this Morning! You have lived since then.""

""what brings you out so early? I thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till five."" --A new personal favorite. That I follow very seriously.

""She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm.""

'He thought for a moment. ""Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?"" he asked, looking at her across the table. 
""A great many, I fear,"" she cried.
""Then commit them over again,"" he said, gravely. ""To get back one's youth one has merely to repeat one's follies.""
""A delightful theory!"" she exclaimed. "" I must put it into practice.""

""Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion.""

It turns out that all of these quotes occur in the first 45 pages, except that last one which is right near the end. And it seems most of my reviews end up being mostly quotes from the book itself, but I figure this is what shaped and informed my reading, so I want to share it with all of you. What do you think of it all?

That said, poor Sybil Vane! Poor James Vane! Poor Basil Hallward! Shit, even poor old Lord Henry Wotton! And Dorian! Oh Dorian! Lead the life you did and for what? 

That's all I am going to say about the book. I don't think I shall read Against Nature, for fear of being seduced like Dorian.

If you're tired of this review or just tired in general, stop now and come back later. I am going to include two more quotes from the book that truly fucked me up. So much I had to read them at least 3 times in a row. And then transcribe them here for you. The last section, thats the one that did it. Beautiful.

Here goes:

""There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral-immoral from the scientific point of view.""
""Why?""
""Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly-that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one's self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry and cloth the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals; the terror of God, which is the secret of religion-these are the two things that govern us. And yet-""
""And yet,"" continues Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice,""I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man among us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sins, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame-""
""Stop!"" faltered Dorian Gray, ""stop! you bewilder me. I don't know what to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don't speak. Let me think, or, rather, let me try not to think.""

Whew.
And:

""There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamored of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those who minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black, fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room, and crouch there. Outside, there is the stirring of the birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleeper, and yet must needs call forth Sleep from her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin, dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colors of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colors, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness, and the memories of pleasure their pain.""

Yep."
924,Lyndsey,Divergent ,"Sep 16, 2010",4,"Everything that rises must Diverge.

Or that seems to be the philosophy of this book. Divergent poses that as a society progresses, it becomes more segregated, as opposed to more integrated. Likely? NO. Fun? HELL YES.

Does it smell like Hunger Games in here to you?

Check out the video for this Hunger Games parody at the end of the article Part Two of The Best YouTube Book Trailers.

Imagine a culture where everyone is separated into groups based on their one key defining character trait.

One of these five traits: Honesty. Selflessness. Intelligence. Bravery. Peacefulness.

We all know that honesty is the best policy and that money is the root... YAWN!! We want to know about those dystopian shenanigans!

Some of the Dystopian Shenanigans in Divergent

 * Jumping off moving things.
 * Jumping off tall things.
 * Climbing tall things.
 * Making out with a camp counselor, I mean, another member of Dauntless. Haha, whoops, just got, um, confused there for a second. *clears throat* I wouldn't know anything about making out with a camp counselor. Because, yeah, who does that?


Beatrice Prior is a member of Abnegation, the selfless, but she dreams of another life. One where she can look at her own reflection without being scolded or dress in something other than a gray potato sack (Fine, they don't actually wear potato sacks, but it sounds like they might as well have). So she chooses to join Dauntless, the fearless and brave, and her life, as well as her disappointed family's, is forever altered. Now known as Tris, she gets thrown into a world of speeding trains, speeding bullets, and unusual looking lead male characters.

You want to know about our Dauntless hottie?

Here are a few snippets of description: The corners of his mouth turn down naturally. He has very long thin fingers, a scar on his chin, and eye sockets that are so deep they sound like a deformity when described by Tris, with eyes so dark blue they're almost black... and a light blue patch in those eyes.

So basically, he looks like.....this?


My Beatrisssssssssssss.

Regardless of the less than stellar description of our love interest, named Four, I still managed to imagine him as a hottie toward the end. (Click to see how I really imagined him.) However, I just wasn't all that interested in him, which seems to be a common occurrence for me lately. Color me blinded by Barrons, I guess. Nearly every love interest I have read since, just doesn't live up to my expectations.

Now, a love interest who would have been intriguing and a major shock: Peter. This douchebag was the Dauntless nemesis of both Four and Tris: however, he was way more interesting to me than Four. If he had turned out to be the other Divergent and had been just acting like a jerk the entire time, it could have been different for me. There was an instant where I thought, ""Maybe?"" But alas, no. He was still just being a douche.

I have to say that, although the world itself doesn't make much sense, since when does any oppressive society make SENSE? At least to those of us who have common sense. Horrible and ridiculous things happen all the time and there have been many ages of oppression throughout history. None of them make a hell of a lot of sense. Slavery? The holocaust? Genocide? Nope, I don't get it. But that doesn't mean it can't and won't happen.

If you are one for analyzing the politics and economics of the world you are reading about, then this one may fall short for you. If you are someone who can easily suspend your disbelief in favor of action and new experiences, then you just might love this. Me? Well, I fall somewhere in between, but more toward loving it.

For nay-sayers who claim that dystopian fiction is unrealistic because those kinds of societies would never work:

I think that is the point these books are trying to make, isn't it? It doesn't work. That's why those types of government either self-destruct or are deconstructed by others, and those who initiate those governments either fall apart or are taken apart. That's one reason that I think books like this are so important; they exist to remind us what humans are capable of: the good and the bad.

Humans can kill and be killed, give life and have it taken from them, love or hate, help others or help destroy them.

Even though this book concentrates on just 5 important characteristics, there are so many more traits that are important. So, what character trait is your strongest? Are you brave? Helpful? Funny? Creative? A good listener? What trait can you use to help transform others? Or the world? That's a question that can be found in between the lines of this book, and it's an important one. One that we should all ask ourselves.

Divergent was one of those books that just consumed every corner of my mind while I was reading it. As much as I love The Hunger Games, the subsequent deterioration of my interest in the sequels still weighs heavy on my mind. Here's to hoping that this is a series that only gets better with age.

""Hang on. This Lord Voldything's back, you say.""


When a book gets too long, there's always the risk of giving up halfway, or start skimming through parts. I think, The Order of Phoenix qualifies as long (the version I read had around a 1000 pages), but I wish it to be even longer. Only Rowling can do that. I didn't find one boring bit, or anything out of place. We are reaching a near-perfect level of writing here at the fifth of the series, which, in my opinion, is an excellent concoction of suspense, hope, triumph, disappointment, humor, anger, happiness, sadness and so many others.


""I've always wanted to try firewhisky -""


Right from the beginning, you'll find everything to be intriguing as always, with an excellent set of new characters being introduced. The main characters around Harry are of course the main focus, and the narration inherits a lot from how the teenage Harry views the world. Average emotional rollercoaster of a teenager blends in nicely with the main plot, and makes things more interesting.


""Ask us no questions and we'll tell you no lies,""


We've finally moved in to the core of the story, and an-action-packed story is being unfolded - full of dark times - with no more holding back. If it wasn't for Rowling's writing, this might've felt like one complex story, not to mention how unbearable it would've been with Umbrige, and also with Lestrange and Fudge closely behind. But everything's put in place perfectly, and even the annoying characters do their part really well. And the ending chapters - though disappointing - are the best and most dramatic in the series so far. This has been one amazing ride, while proving the 'Last-is-Best' still to be true.

No, I am not going to write a review about this piece of nonsense just because I had yet ANOTHER of those incredibly annoying conversations (in a bookstore to top it off!). 

No, I am not.

Oh, for goodness sake! 

It is NOT a great book to broaden your cultural horizons, and whatever the humbug mentioned on Leonardo - it is NOT equivalent to reading a book researched by a REAL art historian, - which is something entirely different from a blind-folded arrogant gold digging bestseller author. 

It is not a well-written, exciting thriller. 

It is Brown in Wonderland, minus the humour, the wit and the beautiful language of the Wonderland Alice visited, and minus the credible plot.

It is not something a bookworm like me HAS to read! Okay? Once and for all, no!

""Lisa, you as a book lover and art historian must love Dan Brown!"" 

No! Period. I don't. I read three ... THREE! ... of his arrogant idiocies posing as novels. I DON'T love him. 

It makes me furious to get the question, over and over:

""How much of what he discovered on Leonardo is true?""

I did not write a review, I hope. It would have been a bad one. Let's forget it."
927,Whitney Atkinson,A Game of Thrones ,"Sep 19, 2015",4,"WE MADE IT!!!! WE HAVE EMERGED VICTORIOUS!!!! 

this book was exhausting and knowing that all the other books are bigger terrifies me but the writing and world building in this book is so vivid and even though I chose favorite characters quickly, the ones that I thought less interesting still had very important story lines and every character has a distinct, well-written personality. Basically I am in love with Daenerys, and I also adore Jon and Arya and Sansa, and even Tyrion. Reading this makes me super interested in the TV show and i've heard so many people telling me to watch it that as soon as I have the time (which might not be for a while lol) I will definitely be looking into that! At this point i'm too exhausted to even consider reading the sequels; i'm giving myself a break after reading this hahaha. geez louise it's a commitment, but it was worth it. 

Also sidenote- the audiobook is great. I'd say I listened 3/4th of this. You can find the entire series on audiobook on Scribd.com, which I have a promo code for ;)

Yeah, yeah, everyone claims Orwell wrote this as about the Russian Revolution, Stalin, and the rise of Communism. 
Pshttt. Whatever.
You know what I think he was really saying?

Beware the Other White Meat!
 
Ok, maybe not. 



Look, I know what you're thinking, That pig looks adorable!, but the next thing you know, that piggy is all grown up and stealing your cookies!



And you'll let it steal your cookies because Mr. Pig has convinced you that giving up your cookies every day was a part of the original agreement! Besides, what do you know, you're just a stupid sheep...



Plus, it's just a cookie, where's the harm?
Not to mention, the last guy who complained about giving up his cookie ended up mauled by that dog. Probably just a coincidence, though.
Right?



But it's ok because pigs are smart. That's what everyone says, right? Smarter than you are, at any rate. And if the pig says it's ok, then it's ok.
I mean look at it! It couldn't possibly have anything but your best interests at heart!



Alright, I'm outta pig gifs.
So, I thought this was a pretty cool book. Sure, it's supposed to be about Russia, but it could just as easily be about the working class in my country. 
Bottom line?
We need to stop listening to the spin doctors on the boob tube and start thinking for ourselves. Question everything, especially the things we think we know are true. It might be a good idea to teach our kids that it's ok to not blindly believe everything we tell them, too. Besides, if we're right, then our ideals can stand up to the scrutiny of children. Otherwise, we risk raising a generation of idiots.
Oh! I found one more pig gif!"

930,David,The Giving Tree,"Dec 03, 2010",3,"HEY, KIDS AND SHEL SILVERSTEIN FANS! COME OVER HERE AND READ THIS!

Okay, this some motherfuckin' fucked-up shit right here. The Giving Tree is the straight-up wack story of how this selfish little ass-faced prick kicks it with this full-on saintly tree. Ever'thin' fine for a while, y'all, with the lil' prick all gettin' up in there an' sayin' to the tree, ""Yeah, you know you mah bitch,"" but then all of a sudden, this jumped-up prick go through puberty, get his chia on or some such shit, and so he's off screwin' the skank-ass bitches on the block all damn day and can't spare one motherfuckin' minute for this poor old tree who waitin' for him and lookin' all motherfuckin' sad an' droopy an' shit. So this little punk-ass bitch come up on the tree -- this is a motherfuckin' tree, hear? -- and ask her ['cuz she a sexy-ass lady-tree] fo' some g's. Well, the tree is all, like, ""I ain't got no cash, bitch. What part o' me say ATM on it? Mmm-hmmm. I thought so..."" And she shoulda held up there, but -- no -- this tree gets all fuckin' benevolent and be, like, ""Well, I got mad apples you can go hustle on the streets."" So this ass-faced prick just, like, boosts all these goddamn apples an' leaves this tree with, like, its weave all out an' shit. So next, after workin' the streets wit his crew, little bitch boy come back, lookin' all older an' jacked-up, and ask the motherfuckin' tree for a goddamn crib. So the tree like, ""Hol' up. Do you even fuckin' see Coldwell Banker all up an' down in here? I think not."" But then, being all kindly an' shit, the tree is, like, ""But I got mad branches..."" And what? She motherfuckin' takes it up back again fo' this fool. Later, another goddamn time, punk-ass bitch come back, lookin' all old an' saggy and wack now, and he like, ""Bitch, what you got fo' me now?"" ""Awww, hell naw,"" tree says, but then she start gettin' all soft an' shit again an' say, ""Why don' you cut down my trunk or some such shit and go 'head and whittle a pimped-out yacht, full-on Hamptons-style?"" He, like, ""Yeah, I thought so, bitch."" And then -- guess the fuck what? -- little shriveled-up, played-out mack come on back wit his ass all hemorrhoided-up an' shit. He look straight-up nasty and old. Tree is, like, ""I know you ain't come t'ask me. All's I got is a motherfuckin' stump, you ass-faced motherfucker. How you gon' come back at me like that?"" This punk-ass bitch is all drooling and jacked-up and just wanna sit the hell down. What do the motherfuckin' tree do? She say, ""Hell no! You motherfuckin' fucked-up fucker, get yo' motherfuckin' ass face out o' here fo' I cut you up good: give you some stank-ass mad tree fungus, motherfucker!"" The motherfuckin' end, motherfuckers. 
 
Okay, so that's not really the way The Giving Tree ends, but maybe it's the way it should. Some time ago, my ex-girlfriend and, afterward, long-time co-dependent friend gave me The Giving Tree as part of my birthday gift. I loved it, but I hated it, too, because I felt so bad for the tree who is endlessly shat upon by this worthless ""Boy""--as he is always known, regardless of age; I longed to console the tree and, maybe a little, to condemn this book as yet another emotionally-scarring ""children's"" entertainment in the manner of Old Yeller. Don't give me any shit about learning valuable lessons. The only lesson I learned was that human beings are nothing but steaming piles of corn-freckled feces, and that I wanted to found a not-for-profit shelter for unloved trees and rabid dogs and any other nonhuman thing, living or not, which was either unwanted or despised. 
 
Having said all this -- and although I don't approve of the treatment of the giving tree -- this book is very moving and very delicate. The delicacy is somewhat counteracted when the reader turns over the book and sees the author photograph of a thoroughly evil-looking Shel Silverstein. He looks like the sort of person who would burn down whole forests of rare giving trees just for kicks. Picture Othello just before he strangles Desdemona. 
 
If you -- and, yes, I'm talking to you personally -- are not moved by the plight of the tree after reading this book, then perhaps it's time to go an' check yo'self: are you the givin' tree or are you the motherfuckin' takin' tree? Or are you the sneak-out-in-the-middle-of-the-night-an'-steal-all-my-shit tree?"

The English Review

First of all I hate Action books, thriller and just action novels. 
I hate book would got that much of Facts that can sometimes got the equal pages of the novels events itself..

I love fiction ,I adore fiction with a hint of fantasy ,that make me escapes of our realistic, raw, ugly most of times, unpleasant world to another different one ..I'm a big fan of Harry Potter -although J.K. Rowling successfully made me read her greedy, realistic, raw, ugly most of times, unpleasant world on The Casual Vacancyand even loving it - 

So what kind of magic does Dan Brown got to make me fall in love with Robert Langdon's adventures?
*Is it his mixing and blending the real historical events with his non-stop thriller ""fiction"". I know some of the historical events he mention are true and some are not-or are they!? :)-?
*Is it the characters itself? The Mickey Mouse watch is amazing touch -as a Disney's big fan- 
*Is it the talented story telling and the easy swift from a POV to another? 
*or Is it the melting of the wall between the Hard and Row REAL Facts,Historical Events and Symbols meanings and Enjoying reading about it -WITHOUT being an expert or even interested to know about them from the start- 

All of what I can say is that the search and hunt of that kind of a thriller novel,A SMART thriller is set for me by Dan Brown with these 2 novels ""Angels and Demons"" and the squeal ""The Da Vinci Code""

_________________________________

The review I wrote of this book and posted on Jun 16, 2010 has, as of today earned 4,264 likes and has a comment thread of 50 pages. Based on this activity, it is the first review shown of the more than 114,000+ reviews on this site.

I regularly get friend requests based solely on this review and likes and comments are added almost daily. 

I would like to take some pride in that, but I really don't. This review is (was) an anomaly in terms of the kinds of books I generally read and the kinds of reviews I generally write. For that reason, I don't accept friend requests from people who've extended them based solely on reading this review.

Back in 2010, goodreads was in its infancy. It had not yet instituted some really questionable content policies which we later learned were part of the lead-up to the site's purchase by amazon in 2013. It had not yet leveraged our freely-given, user-generated content ‚Äì products of our passion for books and for talking about them with others ‚Äì for a higher valuation in the M&A game. The technology and user experience was, if not smooth, idiosyncratically, almost charmingly, glitchy. Now, it's beyond broken, beyond frustrating, and clearly beyond repair (or anyone caring to invest in it).

Back then, in the pre-amazon days, the culture of reading, reviewing, and interacting was freer, more generous, and wayyyyyyyyy less serious. Satirical reviews were not just tolerated, they were encouraged. People recognized and weren't threatened by irony (which, ironically, was one of my beefs with this book: its zealous humourlessness combined with vapid, too-earnest, moralizing).

Some of my favourites of these types of reviews are ""Jason's"" single-line 2009 review of The Road and Paul Bryant's 2010 send-up of Murakami's The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. But there were so many, and apologies to all those still here and active who have written them.

In the early days of goodreads there was plenty of room for fanciful, wildly creative, hilarious reviews that were not reviews but instigations to playful and joyous banter about books and engagement with playful and joyous readers. 

I mourn the demise of the goodreads I once loved. This review, and the daily notifications I get telling me that people have read it, are sad reminders of what ‚Äì and who ‚Äì has been lost."

935,Amanda,The Alchemist,"Jun 07, 2008",1,"***spoilers and bitterness ahead--be forewarned**

I'm not sure that I can capture my utter disdain for this book in words, but I'll give it a shot. I read this book about three years ago and just had to re-read it for book club. It was a steaming pile of crap then and, guess what?, it's a steaming pile of crap now. The main reason I hate this book: it's trite inspirational literature dressed up as an adventure quest. You go into it thinking that it's going to be about a boy's quest for treasure. If you read the back, there are words like ""Pyramids,"" ""Gypsy,"" ""alchemist."" Turns out, this is just The Purpose Driven Life dressed up with a little fable. It's Hallmark Hall of Fame territory set in an exotic locale. Which pisses me off to no end as I normally try to dodge that sort of thing, but here it is masquerading as the type of book I normally like. It's cliche, didactic, and poorly written. 

Just as with Aesop's Fables, there's a moral to the story. And Coelho keeps backing up and running over it just to make sure that we get it (and he capitalizes important key words necessary to understanding it, lest we overlook their significance). If there's one thing Paulo Coelho can do, it's flog a dead horse. 

Essentially, boy thinks he's happy in life. He's a shepherd who gets to travel the world, has all of his needs met, and owns a book which he can always trade for another book when he goes to market. What more can a boy need? Boy is then told by a mysterious stranger that he's not happy at all. Why not? He has failed to recognize his Personal Legend. Everyone has a Personal Legend, which is life's plan for you. However, most of us give up on our Personal Legend in childhood. If you are fortunate enough to hang onto and pursue your Personal Legend, then The Soul of the World will help you obtain it. All of nature conspires to bring you luck and good fortune so that you can fulfill your destiny, whether it's to be a shepherd on a quest for treasure at the pyramids, a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, or, one would assume, a prostitute, drug dealer, or porn star. Hey, we're all fate's bitch in The Alchemist. But I digress. Boy seeks out his Personal Legend and finds it's a long, hard road to obtaining what you want in life. But with faith, perseverance, and just a little goshdarnit good luck, the boy learns to speak the Language of the World and tap into The Soul of the World and fulfills his Personal Legend. And what does he learn? That what he sought was back home, the place he started from. Oh, silly boy. 

So, in summation, here is what you should learn from The Alchemist:

1) Dream. And, while you're at it, dream BIG
2) Follow your bliss
3) Don't be surprised if you find obstacles in your way, but you will overcome
4) It's good to travel and encounter people from other cultures
5) What we most often seek is right in front of us, but sometimes we have to leave home to realize it

To all of these important life lessons, I can only say, ""Well, no shit, Sherlock."" If Coelho knew anything about alchemy, he would have been able to transform this crap into gold. Alas, it's still crap.

936,Mario the lone bookwolf,The Catcher in the Rye,"Mar 07, 2018",3,"One of the most overrated, hyper drivel YA classics ever
 
See, it was published in 1951 by a young (one trick pony?) author
who wrote his higher rated (better?, see ratings) works after The Catcher. And who was, as so many authors of the time, first primarily specialized in short stories and, gosh, The Catcher exactly is a short story collection with
 
A protagonist staggering from one boring episode to the next
Because there is no real freaking action, antagonists except everything the protagonist is interacting with, and no real sense except a teenager rebelling against everything. This all would be fine and entertaining, if there 
 
Would be any wit, more complex characters, and less introspective fringe philosophy of a first person narrator
Who has some controversial thoughts and feelings about life and sexuality. It did a good job at fighting conservative intolerance to get some more open, progressive thinking out into the world, but it just hasn¬¥t the quality and depth needed to be a universal milestone of literature. For young readers of the 20th century, it might have been a mind opening, controversial read that understood them, but 
 
It didn¬¥t age well
Except for the important message of not trying to proselytize kids and teens for outdated ideologies and faith stigmatizing anything kinky, what¬¥s left? Well, depressingly long periods of boredom, because the novel just doesn¬¥t deliver and Salinger is so egocentric to absolutely not care about the millennia old rules of good storytelling and creative writing. One has to suffer with the protagonist who exactly delivers nothing except of some outrageous actions. Other authors like Roald Dahl, Mark Twain, etc. wrote funny and deep novels with real plots that subtly and ironically integrated different topics, issues, and controversies in their work and were loved by audiences of all ages because they were well written. Or the even bigger load of modern YA authors who write dystopian novels in the Orwellian and Huxleyian tradition. But not funny, boring, first person drivel about the stereotypical teenage rebellion against a restrictive, bigoted system? Not so much, 
 
Because it bores the heck out of the readers
I forced myself to finish this overhyped story idea collection and couldn¬¥t even detect some sophisticated message behind the seemingly superficial plot. And what always annoys me the most is that each country around the world has similar patriotic tendencies to pick average and bad books and declare them the gold standard because the author is a proud author citizen. As good as the intentions were and as important the works might have been in creating a more open and tolerant society, today they are the main reason why many young people, tortured with the modified, individualized trash of each big culture and country, hate reading after school. Because they think that reading is associated with boredom and having to find deeper meanings where there are none. 
 
Subjectivity overkill
And it seems that, because of the weaknesses, The Catcher has become a completely subjective, absolutely not universally acclaimed great, experience, depending on the question of if one likes or dislikes the protagonist. Good literature shouldn¬¥t depend on that single factor.

Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:

937,Vit Babenco,The Great Gatsby,"Nov 02, 2015",5,"Our fantasies of grandeur are always restricted by our aesthetic tastes and The Great Gatsby is literally an anthem to vulgarity and fraudulence‚Ä¶
But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace.
The grotesque aesthetic stupidity and the fabulous bad taste of the characters is outright shocking‚Ä¶ Instead of wishing for variety and quality, they just want to get more of everything that glitters‚Ä¶
He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher ‚Äì shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.
‚ÄòThey‚Äôre such beautiful shirts,‚Äô she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. ‚ÄòIt makes me sad because I‚Äôve never seen such ‚Äì such beautiful shirts before.‚Äô
Gatsby is a fraud and the narrator doesn‚Äôt have much sympathy for him but in the end the raconteur finds out that the respectable members of society are just hypocrites and that they are even more fake than Gatsby.
Honesty and intellect don‚Äôt mean a thing, all that counts is the art of pretending and the greatest pretender takes all."
938,Tatiana,City of Bones ,"Apr 23, 2009",1,"** spoiler alert **
           15-year old Clary witnesses a crime at a trendy New York night club. Interesting thing, nobody but Clary can see both the victim and perpetrators. As it turns out, there is an entire invisible to regular people world, and Clary is an unwitting important part of it. 

""City of Bones"" is one of those books that all my female friends and fellow readers simply love, Jace-mania all around. Needless to say, I had to jump on the bandwagon eventually and get me some Jace. Who am I to deny myself a pleasure to fall for a fictional hot, sarcastic and brooding guy? Imagine my disappointment, when I found out that this book was one big pile of hot mess! Sorry ladies, I said it, it's bad.

I had the hardest time sticking to the story and for quite some time I couldn't figure out why. Then gradually I realized that there were several reasons.

Let me start with the editing. I don't really think this book was edited at all, actually. Errors were endless and visible to even my untrained eye: wrong words (""noise"" instead on ""nose""); missing words in sentences; strange mix of POVs (the book is mostly told in 3rd person, from Clary's POV, but occasionally I saw both 3rd and 1st person narration in the same paragraph describing the same events, then there was a page from Jace's POV and a chapter from Luke's); Clary's father was called Jonathan in the beginning of the book, but John in the end. I can go on, but these were the things that I would normally overlook if the story itself was good. Unfortunately it wasn't, and the errors stood out.

I didn't think that the story was cohesive, it just didn't quite flow for me. It read as more of a series of events rather than a novel. I thought there were some parts in the book that served no other purpose but to give our hero an opportunity to act knight-like. I am talking about the entire rat-Simon/vampires extravaganza. This story line could have been edited out completely without any damage to the narrative IMO.
 
I couldn't quite relate to any of the characters either. What made my friends sigh with adoration, annoyed me. I hated the sarcasm, mainly because the jokes, although funny, felt often out of place, plus all of the characters attempting to joke, sounded exactly the same to me. I didn't feel the difference in attitudes of Clary, Simon, and Jace. If Clare had to make Jace a witty sarcastic type, she should have made the wisecracks his exclusive trademark, not everybody's.

The story itself was so ridiculously predictable! I do not normally see what is to come in the books, but in COB, I saw every ""revelation"" coming. Clare just doesn't have a skill to lead to them subtly, it's always in your face: ""Valentine is alive"" revelation (who in this book who was thought to be dead was actually dead? - a serious question), ""your mother put a spell on you"" revelation, the big ""father/brother"" revelation - I could see them all, and I am not the most astute reader out there.

Now, my biggest problem with this book - I've read/seen it all before! Clare borrows so liberally from ""Star Wars,"" ""Harry Potter"" and ""Buffy,"" it is simply impossible to overlook. Valentine - Voldemort/Darth Vader combo; Jace/Clary - Luke/Draco/Leia/Ginny (if it is possible) combo; the Circle - reversed Order of the Phoenix/Death Eaters combo; the Clave - Ministry of Magic; Luke - Lupin/Snape combo; Hodge - Giles/Wormtail combo. I can continue, but will stop here, you get the picture. Granted, there is nothing absolutely original in paranormal genre, but a skillful writer can re-work an old theme and make it new, fresh, and unique. Whatever is original in COB, is not quite thought through. As an example, let's take a ""stele."" After finishing this book, I still have no idea what exactly it does - do you only write runes with it? how exactly do you use it in a battle? why it can open some doors and not others? it can heal, but not everything? it can make you be able to see through a wooden screen, but is it because you write a special rune with it or you use it as a wand? It seems to me stele is pretty much used as a deus ex machina, convenient whenever a quick solution to a problem needed. And what's with all the shadow folk? There is just so much mashed up together - fairies, vampires, werewolves, pixies, jinns. You name any mythical creature, it is in this book. And what about magic? I read about spells made by a warlock, stele rune tricks, curses, where does it end? The limits of magic possibilities were never defined. Bottom line, all these inconsistencies make for one unoriginal and messy imaginary world. And this probably was the main reason why I couldn't connect with this book. 

Finally, I was a little surprised by some of Clare's creative choices. I found both flirtations of at least 35-year-old warlock (he might be older, his age was never mentioned) with a gay teenage boy and reversed Leia/Luke extravaganza quite tacky, if not disturbing. Although I know how Jace/Clary ""family matter"" is resolved in the end, I don't find possibly incestuous relationships appealing.

This review might make it seem like COB is the worst book ever written. I wouldn't say so, after all, I've read ""Breaking Dawn,"" and that book doesn't have any plot. There were some nice Jace/Clary moments, the greenhouse birthday party comes to mind. But was COB the most blatantly unoriginal book I've ever read? Absolutely (although I haven't read ""Eragon"" yet, but I heard a lot about it).

In all honesty, I shouldn't give this book more than 1 star, but I will add a second one as a dedication to one Mrs. Jace Wayland. Would I recommend this book? Sure, many of my friends enjoyed it immensely. Will I continue on with the series? I don't think I will be able to convince myself to waste any more of my time on being mad at a book. I think I will just check out plot summaries on wiki and be done with the series.

P.S. I just read that Cassandara Clare is an avid and famous in certain circles fanfiction writer. I guess that's where all the liberal ""borrowing"" comes from. Mystery solved."

940,Mark Lawrence,Charlotte's Web,"Aug 28, 2011",4,"'pologies to anybody following my reviews in hope of insights into epic fantasy novels - I get through more kids' stuff reading to my little girl (who is too disabled to do it for herself). 

Charlotte's Web is a book I've been aware of for nearly 40 years but somehow managed to avoid reading when I was little. We picked it up at the hospice last week and read the first half, then had to buy a copy at Waterstones yesterday to finish it off (59 years in print and it's still selling for ¬£6.99 in paperback!)

The book's a classic for good reason. It delivers an emotional but refreshingly unsentimental story with twists and turns, and inadvertently lets us have a look at rural American life in the late 1940's. In addition to a strong and engaging story E.B White has powerful prose that doesn't confuse a child, but carries more weight than you're likely to see in most children's stories.

There's a circle of life theme going on, the amusing and varied anthropomorphising of various animals, a county show and prizes to be awarded, oh my! But putting a welcome edge on all this is the bald fact that the pig you can see on the cover is balanced on a constant knife edge with people gearing up to reduce him to bacon and ham at every turn. And although there are tender moments in the story, it's never saccharine *slight spoiler* the rat never comes through with a change of heart, the little girl grows up and loses interest in the animals *end slight spoiler*

All in all a fine children's book. Perhaps it I'd read it when I was 7 I'd be giving it 5*

It also contains the saddest line in children's fiction:(view spoiler)[No one was with her when she died. (hide spoiler)]

941,Reading_ Tamishly,Animal Farm,"Sep 12, 2019",5,"This book didn't read like a 'classic' at all for me. It was so easy to get into. The writing style is simple and amazing. It's short but the story is relevant and weaved in such a way the readers get lots to think and reflect about the working system in a society, especially the political system. 

This small book made me think about the class division and the different caste systems that are still relevant today. The political system is seemingly complicated but this book gave me a glimpse of it in a way how it's being played.
The part which intrigued me the most was the way the common people being manipulated or played with false promises and a better future for them. And that the lives of the ones who rebel or do something different for their betterment ends up not appreciated. 
This small book gives a very clear picture how the actual society works; a vivid description on how the heirarchical system works and will continue as long as the general public blindly keeps on believing that others are going to make their lives better by helping them reach and sit on thrones who will detect them on how to work harder so that such people can party better. 

The part which hit me the most was when one character who worked their whole lives for everyone else ended up as being forgotten and left to their own devices when weak and old with nothing much left for them in the end. 

This book represents well the society we are living in, gives us an idea how the political system works in real and how the rest of us play our roles in the system. 

The best part of reading this book is that it makes me think about how I as a person play my role in the society, how important one vote of mine matters and plays a significant role, how I am ultimately responsible for my own efforts in making the surrounding around me improve and how ignorant I am regarding the ways of the society and the political system. It's just not enough to live. Who is going to stand up for us ultimately? It's not them but we ourselves. Let's start by thinking twice about how easily we believe in the words others promise us for our future. Is it them who we are lifting them making them stand on the tip of our heads or us who's going to actually decide for that?

***Highlight:
The animal characters accurately represent the real working system as is at present"
942,Nilufer Ozmekik,The Little Prince,"Aug 22, 2020",5,"This is my seventh time to reread and enjoy the little prince‚Äôs thought provoking, sad, poetic, nostalgic, powerful, emotional journey to the world! 

Nearly 80 years later from its first release it still addresses to your heart, giving its important social criticism messages and also it gives you hope about friendship, childhood, life. That‚Äôs why after all these years the book is still cherished by both adults and young generations. 

It was also great reflection of France‚Äôs fall at the end of World War II. It‚Äôs time to build a new country that is rising from its ashes. 

Anytime I join this adventure, it makes you cry and smile at the same time which makes this book unique, timeless, lyrical, extraordinary. 

Here are my favorite quotes:

‚ÄúAnd now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are the people?‚Äù resumed the little prince at last. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little lonely in the desert‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is lonely when you‚Äôre among people, too,‚Äù said the snake.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers...‚Äù"

944,Matt,The Princess Bride,"Feb 24, 2009",4,"‚Äú‚ÄòLook: we can‚Äôt go back and we certainly don‚Äôt want to stay here, so we must keep on going as we were before these little things happened. Down. Down is our direction, Fezzik, but I can tell you‚Äôre a bit edgy about all this, so, out of the goodness of my heart, I will let you walk down not behind me, and not in front of me, but right next to me, on the same step, stride for stride, and you put an arm around my shoulder because this will probably make you feel better, and I, so as not to make you feel foolish, will put an arm around your shoulder, and thus, safe, protected, together, we will descend.‚Äô
 
‚ÄòWill you draw your sword with your free hand?‚Äô [Fezzik asked].

‚ÄòI already have. Will you make a fist with yours?‚Äô

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs clenched.‚Äô

‚ÄòThen let's look on the bright side: we're having an adventure, Fezzik, and most people live and die without being as lucky as we are.‚Äô‚Äù
-	William Goldman, The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern‚Äôs Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure 

The first time I sat down to watch to Rob Reiner‚Äôs 1987 film classic The Princess Bride, it was introduced to me with the sort of hushed awe usually reserved for biblical prophets receiving stone tablets. You have to watch this, I was told. You have to. 

The experience was, in a word, mesmerizing. 

I was far too young to catch all the sly nuances in a movie that both precisely deconstructs and joyously celebrates the fantasy-adventure genre, but I loved it nonetheless. The broadness of the comedy. The snappiness of its action scenes. The climbing-race up the Cliffs of Insanity. The ‚ÄúI am not lefthanded‚Äù swordfight. The fire swamp, the rodents of unusual size, ‚ÄúI am Inigo Montoya,‚Äù and freaking Andre the Giant. All of it landed perfectly.

Watch it only once? Inconceivable!

I‚Äôve seen the movie dozens and dozens of times over the years. In the basement of friends; on my couch in the morning; in college dorm rooms; in the theater; drunk and hungover and sober; on my couch in the afternoon; with my kids; with extended family; on holidays; and on my couch late at night. It is endlessly rewatchable, and whenever I catch it, I usually sit down until it gets to one of my five or six or seven favorite scenes. 

For all the glee I‚Äôve taken in Cary Elwes‚Äô smirk, and Christopher Guest‚Äôs six-fingered man, and Billy Crystal‚Äôs zany miracle worker, it probably took me ten or fifteen years to realize that the film was based on William Goldman‚Äôs 1973 novel of the same name. It had never occurred to me that something so purely cinematic started off on the page. 

As a completist, I had to read it. But once I got it, I delayed, and let it linger on the shelf. The film, after all, is nearly perfect, at least in the sense that I couldn‚Äôt imagine changing a single scene. What, exactly, could the book add to my experience? 

Honestly, not that much. The Princess Bride is a good book by a great writer, and it has its share of mic-drop lines. But at the end of the day, I mostly read it for comparison‚Äôs sake. 

*** 
 
Like the movie, the novel has its tongue firmly planted in-cheek. The conceit of The Princess Bride is that it is actually an abridgement of a much-longer book by the impeccably-named S. Morgenstern. Goldman ‚Äì playing the role of ‚ÄúGoldman‚Äù ‚Äì writes the introduction, and also provides a running commentary throughout. He plays this joke right to the end, and my 25th anniversary edition has an epilogue that acts as an excerpt to a sequel that ‚Äì unfortunately ‚Äì never got written. 

*** 

Given its ubiquity, it seems a waste of space to set out the plot. But wasting space is what I do. 

In short, it is the tale of Westley, the farm boy who loves Buttercup; and of Inigo, the Spanish sword master sworn to wreak vengeance on the evil Count Rugen; and of Vizzini, the clever Sicilian plotting war; and of Fezzik, the gentle, slow-witted giant. All of them are thrown together by fate, as Westley tries to keep his beloved from marrying the evil Prince Humperdinck. 

The best description ‚Äì unsurprisingly ‚Äì comes from Goldman himself: 

Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passions. Miracles. 

If this doesn‚Äôt sell you on it, what more can I say? 

***

Goldman, who died in 2018, had one heck of a career, especially in the realm of screenplays. Both Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President‚Äôs Men are widely recognized for the skill of the wordsmithing, with lines so well-crafted they‚Äôve become part of the culture at large. Even his lesser-tier films, such as the Stephen King adaptation Hearts in Atlantis, contain lines that belong inimitably to him. 

In The Princess Bride, Goldman does a nifty balancing act, shifting between the broad and the narrowly-focused, from silly humor to deep emotion. 

All the famous movie scenes are here, such as the ‚ÄúBattle of Wits,‚Äù where the world learned one of life‚Äôs important lessons: ‚ÄúNever go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.‚Äù But there are also scenes excised from the film, such as the strangely heartfelt sequence where Inigo and Fezzik venture into the Zoo of Death. 

***

Having marinated in the film for so long, reading the book-version of The Princess Bride felt a bit academic. I did not read with any sense of wonder at what might come; I knew exactly ‚Äì for the most part ‚Äì what lay ahead. Instead, I read it mostly to see what got left out, what got changed, and how well Goldman made the transition from words to moving pictures. 

One of the great nothing-arguments of our time on earth is the debate over which is better: the book or the movie. It‚Äôs a wholly subjective query that is treated in an entirely objective manner, as though it‚Äôs a mathematical equation with a single right answer. People get really heated about it. 

Generally speaking, I‚Äôm more of a book guy, because I like the expansiveness and depth of a novel as opposed to the streamlining of a commercial film. But there are some major exceptions, usually when a so-so piece of fiction gets picked up by a really talented filmmaker. The best example I can think of is Jaws, which is an all-time movie sharply excised from a plodding, weirdly-paced aquatic potboiler, which has one of the cringiest sex scenes I‚Äôve ever had the dubious honor of reading. 

In the case of The Princess Bride, the movie is clearly superior to me, if only because I fell in love with it first. It is impossible, at this point, to absorb Goldman‚Äôs lines without hearing them read aloud by Mandy Patinkin or Wallace Shawn. 

The book ain‚Äôt half bad; it just so happens that the movie is twice as good as just about anything else you can watch."
945,Lisa of Troy,The Da Vinci Code ,"Mar 31, 2022",2,"The Movie Was Better

When the curator of The Louvre is found murdered, Robert Langdon finds himself in the middle of a mystery filled with riddles and puzzles. Will Langdon be able to figure out all of the clues?

The Da Vinci Code is structured in very short chapters which at first was refreshing but became old pretty fast. Instead of focusing on one major mystery with a bunch of players, there are a bunch of riddles to solve. Of course, I wasn‚Äôt able to solve the riddles (alright well I did solve the first riddle because if I was guessing someone‚Äôs password that would have been my very first try). The prose is simply horrible in this book. The sentences were very short. 

To read this, you have to suspend reality (and not in a good way, yes, I‚Äôm talking to you all of my fantasy friends!). There was always a car ready to whisk them away. The police were constantly outsmarted. Planes could easily be redirected in mid-flight. If you ask Langdon the most basic yes/no question, he would answer you with a full treatise. But apparently this is really quite an aphrodisiac because the women seem to just love this nerdy guy. 

Thank you to everyone who participated in The Da Vinci Code Readalong!

947,Luffy (Oda's Version),The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Jul 15, 2018",3,"This book was more Sylvie and Bruno and less Alice in Wonderland. I didn't know what to make of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I didn't know when to laugh and what was serious.

The treatment given to this story is phantasmagorical. The gags and mini episodic adventures are absurd, pertinently so. The fate of the planet Magrathea is a dream for communists.

I tried to get it, you know. But I don't get most of British humour. I don't get most of Monty Python's Flying Circus, and I don't get Wodehouse and Evelyn Waugh. But what my rating of 3 stars show is that I recognise a master of the word when his pen is being wielded. Such daring too. I loved that part."
948,Jim Fonseca,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Jul 18, 2018",0,"Very unusual for me but DNF, so I did not give it a rating. It's the story of a couple in love where the man comes back at various ages before and after he initially met his wife. When that happens we get the perspective on what's going on from both him and her. I'm not a fan of romance or sci fi, so I guess the combination of the two turned me off. I always give a book at least 20 pages and this one had so many good reviews, I went back and gave it another twenty pages but just couldn't get into it.

949,Colleen Venable,The Hunger Games ,"Jul 18, 2008",4,"Fantastically Written? Ooooh yeah! Compelling? Yup! Super Quick Read? Most definitely! Original? Um...well *shuffles feet, since I seem to be a rare non-five star-er* not original at all really.... 

Man, I wish someone on my friends list here has also read Battle Royale and this book! The Hunger Games WAS pretty fantastic, hence the four stars (though I would have given 3 1/2 if the choice was available.) I ate it up, shouting into other rooms and offices that I was going to be shoving the book into their hands as soon as I was done, but as it went on desha vu was a little too common for me. I know there are major story types out there, ones that are repeated over and over again. Shakespeare retold 200 different ways. The bible reinterpreted to 2,000,000 varieties of tales....but when it comes to YA dystopia, which is by far my favorite genre of any book, originality is one of my main ways I judge a book. FEED felt utterly original. The world of UGLIES felt new. LITTLE BROTHER was just plain amazing. If it's going to be about ""the future"" we don't know about, make it original. In my mind dystopia novels survive on ""idea"" more than ""excecution"" and while the execution of this was beautiful, the idea was hardly new. 

While I have a really good feeling Collins never read, or maybe even heard of, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games was 90% the plot of Battle Royal, minus the guns, the extra blood, the ability to get to know all the other players. In Battle Royal (short explanation of BR plot: 40 students put on island forced to kill each other and winner is set for life and put on TV etc...), the main focus is a love story between two students trapped in the game, two students bonding together with no real urge to kill others...one of whom had a crush on the other forever and it is only revealed during the game. There are so many other similarities, from the ways the gamemakers manipulate, to the ways the media encourages, to one character having a fever and the other taking care of them with soup. There are even ""career"" battle royal players. In BR you see the emotions before and after someone is killed, their last thoughts, the feeling of the person who killed. It's actually really beautiful the way it is done, and so believable that put in an arena teens WOULD turn into savages. In The Hunger Games, yes the main characters were fantastic, and many of the lesser as well, but Foxface is only Foxface, and the Careers are never more than random 1-dimensional bad guys. 

The Hunger Games was very Battle Royale, very The Long Walk (Richard Bachman book), and very much current reality shows. I am not saying it wasn't a GREAT read, I'm just saying it shouldn't shake the publishing earth the way I am pretty sure it is going to. I anticipate this is the next Twilight series people are going to gush over. In a few years we'll all be hosting Hunger Games final book parties. I'll be amongst the attendees I'm sure. 

Also in terms of female main characters, Katiniss may surpass Bella in me wanting to shake sense into a character. Talk about a smart girl being utterly clueless! 

Yes, it was great, but eh, maybe I'm just bitter because I think BR is the better book of the two and while Hunger Games will get tons of praise and likely a rather deserved award or two, BR will continue to be banned in many libraries. Amazing what subtracting guns can do to a story. Suddenly it doesn't feel as violent, but rather is more reminiscent of stories we heard growing up. The number of swords and arrow deaths in traditional fairytales is nothing to freak out about, but if bullets are flying, it will give ""too many ideas"" to teens and therefore must be dubbed an adult book. 

I'm pretty sure if I hadn't read BR just a few months back this exeedingly long review would have been just as long only instead of a rant it would have just been one long squeeeeeal of delight over how much I loved the book. 




Original Comment: Peer pressure, peer pressure, peer pressure. Geez guys! Alright, alright I'll read it!"
950,Sean Barrs,Wuthering Heights,"May 31, 2016",2,"This is a review I never imagined I‚Äôd write. This is a book I was convinced I‚Äôd love. I just have to face the facts, Emily is no Charlotte.

I‚Äôm going to start with the positives. The characterisation of Heathcliff is incredibly strong. He is a man who is utterly tormented by the world. As a gypsy boy he is dark skinned and dark haired, and to the English this rough, almost wild, look makes him a ruffian. He stands up for himself, and bites back; thus, he is termed a monster. In a very, very, Frankenstein‚Äôs monster like sense, his perceived outer image begins to permeate his soul. Call a man a monster, and eventually he may start acting like one. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a rough diamond - a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic; he‚Äôs a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man.‚Äù

He is a very complex man, capable of great cruelty and kindness. The world has made him bitter, and in a way ruined him. He reaps revenge, but revenge always ends the same way; it doesn‚Äôt solve problems but creates more. So he becomes even more tormented, this time by his own actions. 	He is very Byronic, and by today‚Äôs standards a little bit of a bad boy. He has all the standard tropes of an anti-hero, one that becomes a figure that can be sympathised with and hated. He‚Äôs a very complex man. 

The Bronte‚Äôs were directly affected by Byron‚Äôs poetry. Rochester is Charlotte‚Äôs portrayal of a similar, albeit less vengeful, character. Love is the key torment in both works. Heathcliff has been rejected, as Rochester cannot open his heart because of his secret wife. But, rather that overcome his personal loss, and subject the world to his dark and broody personality, Heathcliff actually seeks to do others harm. He is a very sensitive man when it comes to his own emotions, though he lacks any real empathy. He does not care that he is creating more pain for others. He spends his life spreading more hate into the world. His only redeeming quality is his love for Catherine, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse his tyranny. He knows how nasty he is: 

""She abandoned [her home] under a delusion,"" he answered, ""picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished."" 

He's so self-centred: 

  

So I rather like his character, well not like but appreciate the complexity, though the novel‚Äôs structure itself was abysmal. I have quite a few problems with the narrative.

Why is a servant telling us this story as she speaks to a visitor of her master‚Äôs house? Why are we hearing someone‚Äôs interpretation of the events rather than the events themselves? Why is it twenty years later in the form of an extremely long conversation? Why is the servant still actually working for Heathcliff? She would have left. Nobody would choose to work for such a man. It just doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. At times it felt like the credibility of the story was stretched to breaking point. Nelly (the servant) actually being in some of the scenes was almost laughable. Often it was followed by a terrible explanation attempting to justify her presence. It sounded very desperate to me. 

This leads perfectly on to my next point. Half way through the story (the start of volume ii) we are told that the conversation has ended. We then hear the visitor‚Äôs description of the servant‚Äôs narrative about Heathcliff‚Äôs life. I mean seriously? So there are three layers of storytelling. Isn‚Äôt that completely unnecessary and overcomplicated? Why not just have Heathcliff tell the story or at the very least have the servant tell the story from start to finish in one story arc with no time shifts. For me, it felt like Emily wrote herself into a corner with her choice of narrative and desperately tried to write herself out of it to the point of ridiculousness. How much of the story can we believe? How much bias is in the narratives?

Then there was the dialogue overloads. Large parts of the novel were entirely conversational. The narration was minimalistic and bare. The only character whose thoughts we were privy to, again Nelly the servant, was completely irrelevant to the plot. Who cares about the servant‚Äôs emotion and reactions? This isn‚Äôt her story; thus, the dialogue was packed out to the point of unnaturalness to fit in the thoughts of characters whose minds we weren‚Äôt privy to. Simply put, the characters said things people wouldn‚Äôt realistically say in conversation. It was overflowing with emotions and private thoughts. It was awkward. I‚Äôm not talking about private conversations, those don‚Äôt happen as Nelly is awkwardly present for every single event, but announcements or decisions (that should be internal) announced to a group of people. This is why plays have asides and soliloquies. And this is why novels aren‚Äôt told from the perspective of a random servant. 

There is clearly a great story here. Plot wise the novel is wonderful. But the way in which Emily told her story was nothing short of disastrous. It felt like a wasted opportunity. I‚Äôm absolutely horrified at how poor it is. This novel needed to be taken apart, re-wrote, and put back together again. Perhaps then it would have been worthy of the story it failed to tell. I‚Äôve never been so massively underwhelmed in such a blatant lack of skill in a canonised piece of literature, one that has immense critical reception.

952,Lisa of Troy,Brave New World,"Nov 02, 2023",5,"For fans of 1984‚Ä¶..

Brave New World is a dystopian novel published in 1932. Reproduction occurs in a lab. The government conditions children to hate books and flowers while the government promotes certain products (like sports that require a lot of equipment). Everyone looks the same and has similar names. 

The government conditions people through a program of predestiny, and instead of saying ‚ÄúOur Lord,‚Äù the people say, ‚ÄúOur Ford.‚Äù

The book itself is a bit rough at times, particularly in the beginning which is too focused on statistics and numbers. 

However, there is a lot to think about in this book. Although I don‚Äôt know the exact social mores of the 1930‚Äôs, many of the ideas expressed in Brave New World are accurate today.

Consumerism is still a founding principle in the United States where consumer debt is at an all-time high between mortgages, credit cards, student loans, and auto loans. The idea is that one always needs more, more, more. 

Now, let‚Äôs talk about predestiny. If you just work hard, you can be anything, right? 

You could be the next Bill Gates, right?

Let‚Äôs look at the education of some of the wealthiest people in the world.

Bill Gates: He went to a private school, Lakeside prep. According to the Lakeside School website, the tuition for the 2023-2024 school year is $42,000. That isn‚Äôt for college. This is for high school.

Mark Zuckerberg: He attended a private school as well, Phillips Exeter Academy. According to its website, tuition for the 2023-2024 school year is $50,604. 

Jeff Bezos: He attended Miami Palmetto High School and even worked at McDonald‚Äôs. However, he also participated in the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. According to the website, this is a ‚Äúrigorous and fast paced program for academically talented and motivated students.‚Äù The program costs $5,200 plus a $50 application fee.

We talk about predestiny. It seems like we, as a society, need to invest more in education.

953,Anne,Twilight ,"Nov 15, 2008",5,"I loved this book. There. I said it. In fact, I loved the whole series. What can I say? It was a totally unbelievable paranormal love story filled with way too much drama and teenage angst. And I loved it. 
Why?
The series reminds me of ""fair food"". You know, the food you buy when you go to a state fair or carnival? You know you shouldn't want to eat that stuff. And somewhere in your head, there is a little voice telling you that it was prepared by someone who hasn't washed their hands in days.
But you eat it anyway. 
Not only do you eat it, but you look forward to eating more. Deep-fried corn dogs, greasy pizza, funnel cakes, and elephant ears...yum! The way I see it, everyone could use a little cotton candy from the circus. 
Read the books. 
Life is too short not to eat the creamy Velveeta cheese of The Twilight Saga."
954,Celeste,Anne of Green Gables ,"Mar 23, 2015",5,"I so desperately wish I would‚Äôve met Anne when I was a child, because we would‚Äôve been bosom friends. However, I didn‚Äôt first read this book until I was in my 20s, and I was really missing out on something wonderful. But better late than never, right? I‚Äôve since read this book 4 times, and I‚Äôve loved it more every time I‚Äôve read it.
 
Anne Shirley reminds me so much of myself as a child, minus the red hair. She‚Äôs doggedly optimistic, though she can be incredibly dramatic when things don‚Äôt go her way. She‚Äôs always getting into scrapes that seem impossible, even though she always means well. She‚Äôs a dreamer and a lover of nature and novels. I was all of those things as a child, and I think I‚Äôve done a pretty good job of maintaining those characteristics as an adult (even the propensity for getting into trouble, unfortunately). Anne‚Äôs greatest gift is her imagination, and so is mine. I‚Äôve visited thousands of different worlds and time periods through that imagination, and it‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôm the most thankful for. 

Anne adores Green Gables, the little farm where she comes to reside in Avonlea. She loves Matthew and Marilla, the siblings who take her in. Anne is one of the biggest nature nuts I‚Äôve ever come across, and I love how she renames things with more ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù (in other words, more romantic) names, such as The Lake of Shining Waters instead of Barry‚Äôs Pond. I can‚Äôt express to you how very ‚Äúme‚Äù that is! When I was a little girl, I was always naming parts of our land and pretending they were far away places. 

I have always been incredibly thankful to have been raised in the country, where my imagination could run wild every single day. I‚Äôm thankful for spring flowers, summer fruit, rambunctious goats, and mockingbird song outside my window. I‚Äôm thankful for summers in the pool and for wild thunderstorms as I go to sleep. I‚Äôm thankful for the nearness of my family and the distance of the rest of the world. I‚Äôm thankful for the freedom to take a long walk without worrying about my safety. And I see that same thankfulness in Anne Shirley. We are without a doubt kindred spirits, even if she is fictional. 

Another thing I have in common with Anne is a passion for stories, both the reading and the telling of them. I know of nothing else that can transport a person and allow them to live a thousand lives instead of only the life they‚Äôve been given. There is something magical about the ability of letters on a page to create something new in the minds of whoever reads them. Anne of Green Gables is no different. I felt completely at home in Avonlea, and I thoroughly enjoyed following Anne‚Äôs adventures (and misadventures) through her late childhood. 

If I could reach into the world of fiction and adopt any literary orphan, Anne would be one of my top two picks alongside Harry Potter. I have to confess, though, I‚Äôm pretty sure Anne would come out on top if I could only choose one. She‚Äôs enchanting and lives life to the fullest, and she‚Äôs a much better person than she believes herself to be. I love Anne with all of my heart, and I can‚Äôt wait to share her with my niece. She‚Äôs a character that I‚Äôll keep revisiting for the rest of my life, and I can‚Äôt imagine ever tiring of her. Kindred spirits are hard to find, but I definitely found one in Anne of Green Gables.

 Also, isn't this edition lovely?!"
955,Brina,One Hundred Years of Solitude ,"Jan 07, 2017",5,"Magical realism has been one of my favorite genres of reading ever since I discovered Isabel Allende and the Latina amiga writers when I was in high school. Taking events from ordinary life and inserting elements of fantasy, Hispanic written magical realism books are something extraordinary. Many people compare Allende to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who is considered the founder of magical realism. Until now, however, I had not read any of Marquez' full length novels so I had nothing to compare. On this 50th anniversary of its first printing, One Hundred Years of Solitude is the revisit the shelf selection for the group catching up on classics for January 2017. An epic following the Buendia family for 100 years, Solitude is truly a great novel of the Americas that put magical realism on the map. 

Gabriel Garcia Marquez was born in Aracataca, Columbia in 1927. Influenced by his grandmother's vivid story telling, Marquez decided at an early age that he wanted to be a writer. Upon completion of la Universidad de Cartagena, Marquez began his career as a reporter and soon began to write short stories. His earliest stories were published as early as the 1950s, yet in 1964 while living in Mexico City with his young family, he completed Solitude in a mere eighteen months. Finally published for the first time in 1967, Solitude sold millions of copies, establishing Marquez as a world renown writer, leading to his receiving the Nobel Prize in 1982. 

Jose Arcadio Buendia and Ursula Iguaran lived in an isolated Colombian village where branches of the same family intermarried for centuries, resulting in children born with pigs tails or looking like lizards. Determined to end this cycle of incest, Buendia and a group of pioneers crossed the mountains and founded the village of Macondo. In the mid 1800s, Macondo was a fledging community, with Buendia, an alchemist, its most respected member. Jose Arcadio and Ursula went on to have three children: Aureliano, Jose Arcadio, and Amaranta. These names and the personality traits that distinguished the original bearers of these names repeated themselves over the course of a century. 

Throughout the novel and the century of change to Macondo, all the Jose Arcadios were solitary individuals and inventors. Determined to decipher the gypsies secret to the universe, they holed themselves up in an alchemist's lab, rarely seen by the outside world. The Aurelianos, on the other hand, were leaders of revolution. Colonel Aureliano Buendia started thirty two civil wars yet lost all of them. A relic who fathered seventeen sons of the same name and grew to become Macondo's most respected citizen, his spirit of adventure and discovery repeated itself in the descendants who bore his name. 

Women held the family together. First Ursula who lived to be 122 years old and then her daughter Amaranta, the women expanded the family home and raised successive generations so that new Jose Arcadios and Aurelianos would not repeat the mistakes of their namesakes. Yet the same mistakes and characteristics occur: rejected love, spirit of adventure, lone soles willing to live for one hundred years in solitary confinement. Additionally, the two characters who predicted all the events of the novel were not even members of the Buendia family: Pilar Ternera, a card reader who specialized in fates and could look at a Buendia to know his future; and Melquiades, a gypsy who befriended the original Jose Arcadio, leading all the successive generations to a life of solitude. 

At first Marquez equates solitude with death. Later on he includes individuals happy to live out their days alone. In order to make a point of his examples of solitude, he interjects countless examples of magical realism: a man bleeding to death down a street, yellow butterflies announcing a man's presence, a rain of epic proportions that would not end. With these and other countless examples throughout the text, Marquez created a magical realism genre that is still widely in use by Latino writers and others around the world today. 

While used to the magical realism genre, Marquez usage and prose were a treat for me to read. His writing is so captivating, I read the entire novel over the course of a day because I desired to know how the Buendias cyclical existence would either repeat itself or change once and for all. Between the prose and magical realism and a memorable story for the ages, One Hundred Years of Solitude is an epic, genre changing, extraordinary novel. Authors of the last fifty years can credit Marquez' influence in their own work. I feel privileged to have finally read this saga deserving of its numerous awards and top ratings that eventually lead Marquez to earn a Nobel Prize. One Hundred Years of Solitude, a novel for the ages, meriting 5 wonderful stars."

""I've never claimed to be otherwise.‚Äù
Clary Fray goes to one little party with her best friend (Simon)...and there's a teeny-tiny littler repercussion by way of her life being absolutely and irrevocably ruined. 

She witnesses an unusual boy being led to the back by figures cloaked in black, brandishing knives. 

Curious, she decides to investigate...and stumbles upon an exorcism.

The Shadowhunters are just as surprised as she is - mostly because the only people who can see Shadowhunters are other Shadowhunters...but Clary is 100% human, a mundane...or so she thought.

Almost immediately,  Clary's mother goes missing and the Shadowhunters appear to be the only ones who can help her. 

And so, with much trepedation (and sass) she forces herself into their world...and discovers there's quite a few things she's never thought were possible.

Okay, I really, really enjoyed this one....until we got to the twist at the end. Ugh. 

I absolutely 
loved
 the banter. 

Any and all scenes with Jace in it just shone so brightly.

 I mean, how could you not love scenes with lines like this: 
‚ÄúHave you fallen in love with the wrong person yet?""

Jace said, ""Unfortunately, Lady of the Haven, my one true love remains myself.""
Or this?
‚ÄúIs this the part where you start tearing off strips of your shirt to bind my wounds?""

""If you wanted me to rip my clothes off, you should have just asked.‚Äù 
OR THIS? 
‚ÄúInvestigation?"" Isabelle laughed. ""Now we're detectives? Maybe we should all have code names.""

""Good idea,"" said Jace. ""I shall be Baron Hotschaft Von Hugenstein.‚Äù 
However...the ending? Very nearly ruined the book! 

(view spoiler)[ Where we find out that Jace might be Clary's long-dead-brother? It's just...are you kidding me?

PLEASE tell me that surprise-incest is not going to be the new, edgy YA trope.

 I don't think I handle all of the gagging.

AND how in the world do you still kinda sorta like your maybe-brother?

Maybe it's just me but wouldn't any and all attraction be immediately snuffed out? (hide spoiler)]

Four stars because I have a very selective memory she eye top-notch banter.

959,Paula,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Feb 10, 2008",2,"** spoiler alert **
           This book reminded me why I hate classics.

Like Frankenstein, it starts out with a great premise: what if a portrait bore the brunt of age and sin, while the person remained in the flush of youth? How would that person feel as they watched a constant reminder of their true nature develop? And like Frankenstein, it gets completely bogged down in uninteresting details and takes forever to get to the interesting bits. Seriously, in a 230-page novel, the portrait doesn't even start to change until 100 pages in. 

And it's so damn flowery. Every time Lord Harry starts talking (and believe me, he likes to talk) he's so witty. Witty witty witty. Ahahaha, you're soooooooo worldly wise and charming. And entirely cynical! You just have a quip for everything, don't you? Look, reader, look. See Harry. See Harry corrupt Dorian. Corrupt, Harry, corrupt! 

I actually ended up skimming most of the book. I really thought about stopping, but I hoped it would redeem itself by the end. It didn't. I should have just skipped to the last page. So to save you, dear reader, the same pain I went through, is the summary of Dorian Gray (spoilers, of course):

Dorian semi-consciously makes Faustian bargain to transfer all his sins and signs of age to his portrait. He sins and feels guilty about it, but keeps doing it anyway. He finally decides to get ride of the portrait/evidence and stabs the painting. Surprise, it breaks the spell, and he is left ugly, old and dead while his portrait returns to its original form. The end. You can thank me later. 

UPDATE 9/3/12: Since this review is still around and kicking four years later, I thought I might point like-minded individuals to a new parody of classic literature to the tune of Call Me Maybe: Call Me Ishmael!"
960,Calista,Gone With the Wind,"Apr 06, 2020",5,"After 30 years, I have finally read this American Classic. Our family has stories about this book. My mom's mother read this story when it came out. My family inherited an outdoor glider from my great-grandmother who lived in Newport News Virginia and my grandmother sat on that glider couch one summer and read this book. I've heard this story most of my life. I have a dear cousin who claimed this story her favorite book from her teens till after college and I'm not sure about now. She must have read this book between 10 and 20 times at least. I remember thinking as a teen, how could someone, who was 5 years younger than myself read a book over a 1,000 pages long. It amazed me. I have many other family members who read this book and loved it. Well, now I'm among them. 

My dad had a hardback copy of this book on his shelves and when I told him I wanted to read it, he gave me his copy. He has a 5000 book library in his house and he always puts his stamp on the first page that has his name and then he writes the date of when he begins and ends a story. I took up the practice myself and I love that. He started this story Dec. 23rd, 1996, but he never finished it. I started this on March 22nd, 2020 during the pandemic. It was nice to read something from his library. 

This is the great American novel if there ever was one. It was Titanic before the movie Titanic was a big hit. A hug sweeping story set against the Civil war in Atlanta GA with characters to last through history. The story came out in 1936 and the movie came out in 1939 (I did see the movie) By 1939 it had sold over 2 million copies of the book and this was the time of the great depression when no one had much money.

This story romanticizes the South at the time of the Civil War. The historical events are correct and seem meticulously used in the story. The book shows the attitude of the South at this time; it is the perspective of Southerns at this point in time. I grew up in the South and never understood my culture, feeling like an outsider. Several times people asked me if I was from up north when they met me because I didn't fit in. This book helps me to understand the South in a way I never have. I have to say, all the people's attitudes about the South and the way they think are still going on strong today and it really is like the South is rising again to win the country(scary). This mindset is still alive in the country today and we are as divided as back in this time.

I love the characters in this story. Spending 1000 pages with them, I feel like they are walking, breathing people. I think one of my favorite characters in the history of literature is Melanie. I so love her soft strength and loyalty. She was a Trueheart. They are people that simply make the world a better place and she can only see only the good in people. She believes in people. 

The end of the story got me and I cried so much. The last 50 pages are heart wrenching. 

Scarlett, the famous Scarlett O'Hara is an Anti-hero. She is the villain of the story. She is shallow and doesn't really understand people while she is a master manipulator and so strong. I do admire her strength in this story. No one can put her down. I do love that Rhett helped to free her from the constraints of her society that she hated even if she didn't know she did, but she didn't have the self-character to stop herself from going too far or getting too brutal. She deadens her heart basically. By the end of the book, I simply hated her. In that final moment, the climax, where she finally figures out what she wants, I start to feel for her again and my hate gave way to pity for her. 

Rhett is such a scoundrel, but he is fiercely honest and can not stand pretense. He knows Scarlett for who she really is and he loves her. He was hard and rough, but I always had a soft spot for him. He too could not accept the constraints of his strict society and he threw them off fiercely. I admire him. But the end breaks my heart for him. He is one of the best father figures I have seen. It is amazing to see him and Bonnie together. It is some of my favorite parts of the book to see his love transform him. 

Melanie, seeming so mousey, but there is a strength of character no one else has in this book. She is kind to all and she ignores class and what others would do. She is kind to murderers, prostitutes and anyone that needs help. She always says what she means and she is the silent hero in this story, the one shining good person in this story. Rhett knows it and he has the utmost respect for her. She is the greatest character written on the page in my opinion. Scarlett gets all the attention, but Melanie is something else here. She is a true angel on Earth. She made the story and really it all hinged on her. 

Ashley is the love interest for Scarlett, the beaux she can never have. He is a refined gentleman who knows nothing else in life and when his world collapses, he is nothing. 

Scarlett has unrequited love for him the entire novel. She doesn't really see him, she only sees what she wants to see. This love only lives in her mind. She has made this man what love is and it blinds her to reality and she prizes herself for being so grounded in reality. She wants to understand Ashley, but she can't. She is too different and she only wants to change him to be who she wants him to be. 

I'm sure most people know the gist of this story and they know the famous last line. The movies adds the word 'Frankly'. This is a love story, but it's a tragedy at the same time. The ending could not be more perfect. It is the most gut-wrenching, most painful, most perfect ending I have read. 

I can only say that this novel is worth every word. I admit that pages 600-800 do drag a bit, but it's still interesting enough to keep going and it's worth reading. Everyone should read this book once in their lives. I was swept away in this story. It is simply a masterpiece. It is the American classic novel. 

I have loved this book and I will be sad not to be able to visit with Melanie and cluck my tongue at the goings on of Scarlett. My heart still weeps for that ending. Oh goddess, I love this story. What an experience!! The movie is good, but it simply can't move you the way the book can. Rhett Butler is perfect in the movie and he was my picture in my head reading this."
961,"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies",The Lightning Thief ,"Feb 15, 2014",4,"Chiron looked surprised. ‚ÄúI thought that would be obvious enough. The entrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles.‚Äù
As someone who has worked in Los Angeles, I can tell you that this is completely accurate.

While Harry Potter was spending his summers at the Dursleys, Percy Jackson attended Camp Half-Blood. This book has done the impossible: it has redeemed the name of Percy.

Yes, that's right, that snot-faced, lily-livered waste of air of the very same name from the Harry Potter universe. That name is now relegated to the ranks of ""acceptable,"" because of my love for this book.

Perseus (Percy) Jackson is the kind of kid with whom you can't help sympathizing. He is the type that's born under a dark star, because inevitably, wherever he goes, whatever he does, however good his intentions, he can't help but fuck everything up. Everything that can, does and will go wrong. A simple field trip can turn into a disaster in seconds.

Jay-Z's got 99 problems, Percy might have more. He nearly flunks all his classes, he's got dyslexia, he's got ADHD, and then there's Nancy Bobofit.
Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends‚ÄîI guess she‚Äôd gotten tired of stealing from the tourists‚Äîand dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grover‚Äôs lap.
‚ÄúOops.‚Äù She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.
Nancy Bobofit is not a major character in the book. I have to mention her because her character resounded with me. I had my own Nancy Bobofit back in grade school, only her name is Mimi. Nearly 2 decades later, the memory of her horrible face still makes me shudder. But I digress.

As if the bullies aren't bad enough, his dad is a no-show, his stepfather is LITERALLY named Ugli, and there are crones foretelling Percy's death as well as a minotaur chasing his ass around. AND NOBODY'S TELLING HIM A SINGLE FUCKING THING. What's with all the secrecy, man?

As it turned out, Percy is *whispers* special. He is a half-blood, meaning one of his parents is a Greek deity. He gets sent to Camp Half-Blood, with roughly 100 other kids like him.

It's a freaky place for a kid who's known nothing but relative normalcy his entire life. All of a sudden, he's playing Pinochle with a Greek God (Dionysus---what a drunk), his best friend Grover turns out to be a satyr, and the gorgeous blond girl who rescues him thinks he's a doofus and she keeps calling him ""seaweed brain.""

To be fair, Percy had it coming. He is kind of a seaweed brain.
""Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey must really like olives.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, forget it.‚Äù
‚ÄúNow, if she‚Äôd invented pizza‚Äîthat I could understand.‚Äù
‚ÄúI said, forget it!‚Äù
Not your best moment, Percy.

As it turned out, Percy IS special. His dad is one of the Big Three gods. Which kind of sucks, because that's not supposed to happen.
‚ÄúAbout sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn‚Äôt sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful.""
A lot of people would think it was pretty cool to have such a powerful dad...not really.
Now that I was declared a son of one of the Big Three gods who weren‚Äôt supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive.
Not only does Percy have to struggle to fit in at Camp Half-Blood, but there's some shit going on in Mount Olympus. The gods are fighting again (when are they not)...
""During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: ‚ÄòMother Rhea always liked you best,‚Äô ‚ÄòAir disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,‚Äô et cetera.""
...and consequently, like a brother playing a prank on his younger siblings, someone's stuff was stolen. And Zeus thinks that his bro, Poseidon, put Percy up to it.

Of course, blame the poor kid. Now Percy is shit out of luck YET AGAIN, and he's got no choice but to go on this huge stupid quest into the underworld (Los Angeles, ha!) to clear his name.

He's not alone, he's accompanied by the snarky, gorgeous, fiercely competent Annabeth (she of the seaweed brain name-calling), as well as the most incompetent satyr that ever lived.
In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart‚Äôs Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff‚Äôs ‚ÄúSo Yesterday,‚Äù both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.
It's going to be a loooooooong trip to the Underworld.

The Setting: THIS. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GREEK MYTHOLOGY. I am a Greek mythology buff. I FUCKING LOVED THIS BOOK. This book is just absolutely fucking perfect in every way when it comes to rewriting and reinterpreting the Greek pantheon. It is so hilariously, awesomely irreverent, but completely fitting. The gods are reimagined, but they stay true to their true nature, and the myths are retold in a cheeky, flippant manner that had me giggling my ass off. This book is so fantastically snarky to the Greek gods. Everything is incredibly well-explained to a lay audience, like how the Greek gods can't seem to keep it in their pants.
Annabeth nodded. ‚ÄúYour father isn‚Äôt dead, Percy. He‚Äôs one of the Olympians.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs...crazy.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs it? What‚Äôs the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they‚Äôve changed their habits in the last few millennia?‚Äù
And apparently, the habit runs true for both male and female goddesses.
‚ÄúWhat? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist is that?‚Äù
The existence of Greek gods and goddesses themselves are well explained, and believable.
‚ÄúCome now, Percy. What you call ‚ÄòWestern civilization.‚Äô Do you think it‚Äôs just an abstract concept? No, it‚Äôs a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it.""
""Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods.""
I had my doubts about the execution of the premise of Greek mythology, and all my doubts have been destroyed. his book does great justice to the Greek gods, it is the most faithful rendition than I have ever read.

The Characters: Yes, Percy is a special snowflake, but HELL, I LOVED THE LITTLE SHIT. He's got a special destiny. He is a special child. I DON'T CARE. Percy is such a sympathetic character, and although he won't be replacing Harry Potter in my heart any time soon, there is a special spot for him. He can give up pretty fast. He's kind of a wimp, but you know, finding out that you're a hald-blooded demigod is kind of a big deal, and I understand his attitude of ""GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.""
I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. I waved back.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt encourage them,‚Äù Annabeth warned. ‚ÄúNaiads are terrible flirts.‚Äù
‚ÄúNaiads,‚Äù I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. I want to go home now.‚Äù
He doesn't really want to do anything big. He's pretty stupid sometimes (Auntie Em, geez), he's not exactly heroic. He only does the heroic shit when there are no other options.
‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than being turned into a dolphin.‚Äù
I loved Annabeth, she is all I could want from a female supporting character. I can't say that I'm fond of Grover...but I can't help feeling that we'll be seeing more of him in the future.
‚ÄúBut a quest to . . .‚Äù Grover swallowed. ‚ÄúI mean, couldn‚Äôt the master bolt be in some place like Maine? Maine‚Äôs very nice this time of year.‚Äù
Overall: a fantastic book. A good middle grade book makes you feel like a child again, and this book did just the trick. I found myself giggling throughout the book, and an hour after reading it, there's still a smile on my face that can't be wiped off."

Remedios the Beauty was proclaimed queen. √örsula, who shuddered at the disquieting beauty of her great-granddaughter, could not prevent the choice. Until then she had succeeded in keeping her off the streets unless it was to go to mass with Amaranta, but she made her cover her face with a black shawl. The most impious men, those who would disguise themselves as priests to say sacrilegious masses in Catarino‚Äôs store, would go to church with an aim to see, if only for an instant, the face of Remedios the Beauty, whose legendary good looks were spoken of with alarming excitement throughout the swamp. It was a long time before they were able to do so, and it would have been better for them if they never had, because most of them never recovered their peaceful habits of sleep. The man who made it possible, a foreigner, lost his serenity forever, became involved in the sloughs of abjection and misery, and years later was cut to pieces by a train after he had fallen asleep on the tracks. From the moment he was seen in the church, wearing a green velvet suit and an embroidered vest, no one doubted that he came from far away, perhaps from some distant city outside of the country, attracted by the magical fascination of Remedios the Beauty. He was so handsome, so elegant and dignified, with such presence, that Pietro Crespi would have been a mere fop beside him, and many women whispered with spiteful smiles that he was the one who really should have worn the shawl. He did not speak to anyone in Macondo. He appeared at dawn on Sunday like a prince in a fairy tale, riding a horse with silver stirrups and a velvet blanket, and he left town after mass.

965,Jessica Edwards,Divergent ,"May 04, 2015",4,"I read this book before actually watching the film, and I'm going to be honest and say that I prefer the book. 
I've said before that I don't like to read a lot of Dystopian books, but I made an exception on this book because it was coming up a lot on my Goodreads Homepage, and I was surprised with how much I enjoyed it. 

Sixteen year old Tris Prior lives in a futuristic world in which society is divided into factions. 
When each person enters adulthood, he or she must choose a faction and stay in it for life. 
There is; 
Abnegation, which values selflessness. 
Amity, which value peace. 
Erudite which values knowledge.
Candor which values honestly. 
Dauntless which values bravery. 

Beatrice Prior (Tris) is a member of Abnegation with her brother Caleb. 
Every boy and girl must take an aptitude test to decide which faction they are most suitable for. 
The test starts with a confrontation with a vicious dog. 
Tris shows Abnegation, Erudite and Dauntless and because of this, it means she is something called Divergent. 
Tris is warned to never tell anyone about her results, because being a Divergent is incredibly dangerous. 

Tris is strng willed, brave and she's reluctant to show any kind of weakness which I freaking loved!

The Dauntless instructor known as Four, becomes Tris' primary love interest. He is known as Four because during his own Dauntless initation, it was revealed that he only has four years. Four was also born Abnegation, but he chose to Dauntless to escape the abuse of his father. At first, Four has an elusive, mysterious personality and he's quite mean to Tris, but he eventually allows himself to become close to Tris. 

Now I'm going back to reading Dark and Twisted books xD"
966,Lisa,Anne of Green Gables ,"Jun 25, 2014",5,"Which books changed me as a reader? 
 
One would like to answer that Tolstoy or Dostoevsky or Dickens or Lagerl√∂f or Proust determined my path as a lifelong reader. But I doubt that is the case for most of us. They are more often the effect of falling in love with an entirely different kind of book, a root cause leading all the way to tackling Ulysses.

One of the most inspiring books I read as a young girl was the seemingly endless series of Anne (with an ""e""), who has all the odds against her, and yet grows up to be a loving, caring, independent and determined woman who consistently follows the path her heart and brain dictate to her, even or especially when it goes against the narrow conventions of her conservative environment. She doesn't win the hearts of her community by being sweet and subdued and grateful, though. She wins them by showing bravery and creativity!

She taught me to love the poem ""The Lady of Shalott"", and I learned it by heart with her! She taught me small town prejudice and the value of education to stand above pettiness. She taught me that love can exist in the strangest of places, and I think I loved her in the same way her shy stepfather Matthew did. She taught me that one can be wrong and still get it right. 

Lucy Maud Montgomery taught me the power of storytelling to change the hearts of adolescents who are reading and living in the world of fiction. For I have grown up in rural Canada a century ago. Yes, I have, several times! Just like I grew up in an English boarding school with Sarah Crewe, admiring A Little Princess the most when she was starving.

967,Federico DN,The Fault in Our Stars,"Feb 24, 2014",5,"‚ÄúSome infinites are bigger than other infinites.‚Äù  

In this novel we meet the story of ""Hazel Lancaster‚Äù, a fragile sixteen years old with terminal lung cancer. Life is hard, but that much harder even still with cancer. Each day is fiercely fought against a certain fatal destiny; until one day Hazel crosses paths with ""Augustus Waters"", another young terminal soul. Even in those days close to death, life can unexpectedly turn and change forever, for good, and for bad.

Reading with your heart is sometimes dangerous, but it is the only way I know to read. I swear with this book made me feel ill and die a little, and maybe a tiny part of me did. These pages contain an indescribable amount of pain, excruciating pain, but the magical moments within, perhaps scarce, but wonderfully unique, made this experience extremely worthwhile. An invariably tragic story, certain to make you tear again and again. Extremely moving, and, occasionally, very inspiring and uplifting; with a fair share of funny moments too. Heartbreakingly beautiful. An abundance of quotes and moments to remember. Highly Recommendable. A young adult masterpiece.

***** The movie (2014) is a nice adaptation, decently faithful to the book. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort play an excellent lead. Many endearing moments, and a lot of tearing ones too. The book was vastly superior in every single way, of course; still, in a world where movies so often butcher the book, the TFIOS movie is a wonderful experience to complement the reading, and a whole lot less painful; easier to watch, easier to love.

968,Christy Stewart,1984,"Dec 13, 2014",1,misogynistic shit
969,Caroline,The Help,"Sep 22, 2009",1,"I was uncomfortable with the tone of the book; I felt that the author played to very stereotypical themes, and gave the characters (especially the African American ones) very inappropriate and obvious voices and structure in terms constructing their mental character. I understand that the author wrote much of this as a result of her experiences growing up in the south in the 1960's, and that it may seem authentic to her, and that she was even trying to be respectful of the people and the time; but, ultimately, I thought that it was written from a very narrow, idealized, almost childish perspective of race relations without a true appreciation of the humanity and soul of the characters. And the ultimate theme & message (i.e. ""why, we're all the same - there's no difference between us after all!"") only reinforced my feeling that this is written from someone who has a very undeveloped or underdeveloped concept of race and race relations in the United States. The author would benefit from exploring authentic African American voices (Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou) and understanding the scope, range and (most important) the foundation of the emotions genuine African American characters express as a result of their journey as a people in the US (hope, frustration, drive, passion, anger, happiness, sadness, depression, joy)."

971,Lisa of Troy,Little Women,"Jul 02, 2022",5,"The two books that I have read the most in my life: Little Women and Walden. 

Louisa May Alcott wrote Little Women in 1868. It centers on the 4 young March sisters: Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. Each of the sisters has a distinct personality. Meg is the oldest, Jo is the writer and tomboy, Amy is the vain one, and Beth is a saint. The sisters are guided by their mother, Marmee, and they strike up a friendship with the next-door-neighbor boy, Laurie. 

Little Women follows the March sisters as they grow up. Each chapter is relatively short and usually features a moral lesson without being preachy (much like parables in the Bible). 

Transcendentalism

Now, I mentioned Walden. What in the world does that have to do with Little Women? Why I am so glad you asked (or if you didn‚Äôt I will tell you anyways).

Walden is authored by a man named Henry David Thoreau. He also lived in Concord, Massachusetts, the same as Louisa May Alcott. Additionally, Thoreau and Louisa May Alcott were friends. They were both transcendentalists. Transcendentalism is centered around the philosophy of simple, plain living with high thinking. 

When was the last time you received an advertisement that said, ‚ÄúBuy less!‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop buying things. You are enough!‚Äù? If you are like me, that has never happened. Yet every day, we are inundated to buy more concealer, a new pair of skinny jeans, a lavish vacation, or a gigantic mansion that will surely make us happy. Transcendentalism is anti-consumerism. It is a reminder that there is another way to live. 

Little Women is the more digestible version of Walden, but if you loved Little Women and enjoyed the morals therein, I highly, highly, highly suggest Walden (alright I suggest Walden to practically anybody). 

Jane Austen

The last time I read Little Women was before the internet existed. When I picked this book up again for this reread, I am a completely different reader, and I have even more respect for Louisa May Alcott than before. One of the things that I simply hate about Jane Austen is that her characters just seem to sit around and do nothing but complain about men and their highest desire is to be married (the female characters also do a bunch of silly things). 

Louisa May Alcott is the opposite of Jane Austen, and I like her more for it. Her female characters are strong. At the beginning of the novel, both Meg and Jo are working jobs to support their family. Jo dreams more of being a writer than getting married. Marmee is more focused on raising wonderful people versus marrying off her daughters. 

One of the characters in Little Women refuses a marriage proposal. When she says no, she says that she really means no. In Jane Austen‚Äôs novels, her heroine receives multiple marriage proposals, and she says no and then yes. This is very confusing to young readers. Are you supposed to say no when you really mean yes? I think Louisa May Alcott has the better idea of just saying no when you mean no. As an introvert if I get even an inkling that the other person isn‚Äôt interested, I will never try again so if you mean yes, you should probably say yes and leave mind games to Jane Austen novels.

Overall, Little Women is a timeless classic, one that should be read over and over again.

972,Lu√≠s,Catcher In The Rye,"Nov 09, 2020",5,"There are books that we love without knowing why. Is it their form, content, writing quality, or the story they tell? We read them, cry or smile, and even remember them years after finishing them. The Catcher in the Rye is, for my part, in this category. A great classic that I read late but fortunately not too late. Does he awaken in me this adolescent that we have all more or less buried in us? Surely. Did he seduce me with this natural shade? Is this language written down on paper as it comes out of the mouth and the young man's mind searching for himself? Indeed, but after all, whatever. Holden Caulfield takes us to bourgeois America in the 1950s, from his college, where he just has been dismissed, to New York Central Station. Scrolling through friends, families, and acquaintances, and delivering us, by freeing ourselves, his wounds and joys, his loves and dislikes of people and things, of life, of his teenage life. But enough talk - ""Digression""!! (you will understand by reading it) - read on."
973,James,Charlotte's Web,"Jan 07, 2012",4,"If you've never read Charlotte's Web by E.B. White, you are utterly missing out on a classic Newbery Honor award winner. Go to the library now and borrow this book first published in 1952. You shouldn't buy it (unless you have children or are giving it as a present), but choose to embrace the entire experience of being a small child walking through your public library's doors, searching for an amazing book and finding yourself bringing home a tale that will make you cry and fall in love all at the same time. And don't spoil it by watching the cartoon or regular movies made based on the book until you've read it yourself! It's important....



At a quick glance, a little pig arrives on a new farm and is basically going to be entered into a contest to win a prize for the farm owner. But the pig is scared and confused, turning to all sorts of other farm animals for love and guidance at his new home: chickens, mice, birds and of course, Charlotte, the friendly spider. To help save the pig, Charlotte spins webs overnight about the pig's talents in the hopes that he'll be saved from the... sniff sniff... chopping block even if he wins the contest for best pig. But there's so much more going on in this book...



Charlotte is everyone's mother. She's everyone's teacher. She's everyone's friend. As Pollyanna as it will sound, we should all have a Charlotte in our life to help us grow up and mature into terrific, radiant and humble human beings. (I'll avoid calling us ""some pig"" as the other message she crafts). All the lessons children can learn from this book are important, even the ones about death. I won't spoil it, but despite all the efforts across all the animals and the people in this treasure, someone doesn't make it. It's on the same level as ""Bambi"" in my opinion when it comes to a must-read for children, even if the harsh realities of life are exposed.

Please go read it. :)"
974,J.G. Keely,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"May 26, 2007",3,"I was savaged by a miniature poodle the other day--wait--no, someone protested my review of The Giver the other day. If you have any pent-up rage from that college lit teacher who forced you to think about books, be sure to stop by and spew some incoherent vitriol--my reviews are now a socially acceptable site of catharsis for the insecure.

In any case, one of them made the argument that children need new versions of great books that are stupider, because children are just stupid versions of normal people. Happily-enough, The Giver is a totally stupid version of A Clockwork Orange or whatever Dystopian book (actually, it's a rewrite of Ayn Rand's Anthem). 

Coincidentally, in my review of Alice In Wonderland, I happen to put forth my own philosophy regarding children's books. In short: they should present a complex, strange, many-faceted, and never dumbed-down world, because presenting a simple, one-sided, dumbed-down world both insults and stultifies a child's mind.

However, if someone were to say that this book were a childrenized version of Starship Troopers, I wouldn't sic a poodle on them. Both present a human/bug war, deal with the issues of death, war, the military complex, human interaction, personal growth, and all that good stuff. 

Also, both authors have their heads up their asses and there must be a pretty good echo in there since they keep yelling their hearts out about one personal opinion or another. However, Orson Scott Card doesn't get into his pointless author surrogate diatribes until the second book in this series, so we may enjoy the first one uninterrupted. 

So it's a pretty good book for children, and like romeo and Juliet, it's easy to see the appeal: kid defeats bullies and plays videogames to save the world(in one of the sequels, they save the world by making angry comments on the internet--surprising that one isn't more popular here). But more than that, it's not a bad book in general, so I guess I don't have to bother defining it as dumbed-down, or 'for kids'. Then again, a lot of grown-ups seem like they need their books dumbed-down. Just look at The Da Vinci Code compared to The Satanic Verses, or Foucault's Pendulum; or all three compared to The Illuminatus Trilogy. I'm pretty sure when it comes to stupid versions of things, adults have the monopoly."
975,Reynje,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Dec 01, 2011",3,"If, like me, you lurk on frequent tumblr, you will have realised that there is only so far you can scroll before you hit something like this:





Stephen Chbosky‚Äôs epistolary novel has something of a cult following, and the quotes that litter the internet seem almost anthemic, given the passion with which they are re-blogged, quoted, slapped across artfully light-leaked photographs and ‚Äúliked‚Äù. 

A generation appears to have adopted The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and by extension it‚Äôs narrator Charlie, as a sort of symbol of the experience of adolescence. Frequently criticised and challenged, Perks seems to offer its devoted fans a sense of connection, of understanding, of honesty about things left unspoken, or whispered behind hands and closed doors. This book speaks to the sense of alienation that many teens experience, the questions of who they are and where they belong. Charlie has become a response to ‚Äì and I mean no disrespect by this, as I was/am a voice in this ‚Äì a collective, plaintive cry of ‚Äúnobody understands me‚Äù.

It also seems to have become an unofficial badge of hipsterism, and therein lies the reason for my cautious (view spoiler)[okay, biased (hide spoiler)] approach to reading this book. 

To be blunt, I expected to dislike Perks. I know my reading tastes quite well by now and I no longer feel the need to read books based on any kind of social or intellectual cachet apparently attached to them. If anything, that just makes me more inclined to baulk at picking them up. 

So I confess to a little chagrin at the realisation that I don‚Äôt hate this book. I don‚Äôt even dislike it. I‚Äôll push the boat right out and say I was rather moved by this story. 

While some of the issues and content in Perks may seem less groundbreaking now, more than a decade after it‚Äôs initial publication, I think it‚Äôs fair to say that they still resonate with readers. There‚Äôs been a lot of water under the bridge since 1999 in terms of ‚Äúedgy‚Äù or ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù YA books, so it‚Äôs possible that the impact of the explicit or implied events in Chbosky‚Äôs novel are somewhat softened by comparison. Regardless, it‚Äôs still a book that successfully captures the way these topics are internalised by the protagonist, and it‚Äôs evidently a voice that continues to engage and move its more recent audience. Basically, it‚Äôs not strictly the topics that appeal, so much as the manner in which they‚Äôre approached and discussed. 

That said, there is a lot going on in this book, and I have to wonder whether the sheer breadth of the issues touched upon lessens the strength of the story. And not in the sense that I think the events are unrealistic, necessarily, but more that (and I offer this opinion with some trepidation) at times Perks reads like it‚Äôs a bit in love with its own moroseness. The novel‚Äôs gaze is so relentlessly self-involved that I can‚Äôt help but feel that there is something indulgent in its tone, which I was not enamoured with. 

Whether ‚Äúwallflower‚Äù is a strictly accurate descriptor for Charlie is a topic I‚Äôve seen expanded upon in other reviews, and I won‚Äôt go into that much here. Charlie is evidently an introvert, allegedly ‚Äúgifted‚Äù, who has a rich and consuming inner world, but I think it‚Äôs clear that there is more at play here than simple shyness, intellectually and socially speaking. While some of Charlie‚Äôs emotional state is explained at the end of the novel, I feel that there‚Äôs even more to Charlie than Chbosky ever reveals, hinted at by the apparent naivety of his fifteen / sixteen years.

What I did appreciate, and what ultimately caused me to like this book, was how accurately Charlie‚Äôs experiences with anxiety and depression were presented. Prior to this, I hadn‚Äôt read a book that so closely mirrored the physical and emotional manifestation of anxiety as I am familiar with it. The deeply unsettling sensation of nebulous tentacles of panic radiating out in search of something to fixate on, of instability and uncontrolled sadness, honestly made me feel nauseous. I can‚Äôt help but wish I‚Äôd had this book in my hands when I was teenager, when it probably would have meant the world to me. Anxiety is an incredibly frightening and isolating condition, and I think this book communicates that very truthfully. The sensation of being a spectator of life, rather than a participant in it, is all too relevant and close-to-home for many who have experienced a mental illness in some form. 

It‚Äôs probably no surprise then, that I found Chobsky‚Äôs characterisation one of the highlights of this book. From Charlie himself as the narrator, through the supporting cast, I felt that I knew who these people were, that they were real. (It actually makes me curious to see the film adaptation, and how the nuances and subtleties of the characters translate to the screen). 

I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôll be joining the ranks of dedicated, vocal fans of The Perks of a Wallflower, leaving a trail of quotes in my wake across the internet. But I am quietly appreciative of this book, and the powerful, unique experience of reading it.

Ode to a Readalong (or I‚Äôm Sorry I Abandoned You Shirley) (or This Poem Is Too Cool To Rhyme)

I tried to be a hipster today
But they said my haircut wasn‚Äôt cool enough
So I guess it‚Äôs back to being a real nerd
Instead of a pretend one

Then I thought I'd read The Perks of Being a Wallflower
In my scarf with my fixie-riding friend Shirley
Turn up my Smiths record really loud
And contemplate my infiniteness

But my mockery proved empty, hollow like my heart
I wept bitter tears as I turned each page
Trapped in a glass cage of emotion
As I realised I will never be hip

Ever.

976,Tim,Of Mice and Men,"Aug 07, 2021",4,"""Hey Tim, old buddy‚Ä¶ I hear you've been depressed recently. A book should cheer you up, right?""
""Why yes Tim, that sounds delightful. Got any good ideas?""
""How about a classic?""
""Brilliant idea Tim! One I haven't read?""
""Of course! How about Steinbeck?""
""I don't know‚Ä¶ I hear he's a bit depressing.""
""Come now, it's only 105 pages! How depressing could it be?""

‚Ä¶

Should I just end the review there? Nah, of course not. 

 

Of Mice and Men is one of those books that pretty much everyone has read. I once saw an article that said it was one of the most commonly read books in High School classes in America. Somehow it is another one of those classics that I managed to never have assigned to me in both High School or College (and I majored in English). Well, I've read it now. My thoughts? 

Well, it's a wonderfully well told story, frequently feeling more like a play than a novel, but I mean that as a compliment as it makes for a fast paced conversational tone. It's depressing as all hell mind you, but wonderfully told. 

Did I enjoy reading it? No, no I sure as hell did not. I mean the writing is well done, Steinbeck created one of the best literary pairs ever written and managed to have the most perfect moment of foreshadowing I've ever read (in the form of a dog, so animal lovers beware!). I'm very glad I read it and genuinely liked the book. Enjoyment though? No, no and no.

Do I have anything else to add? Not really. It's a short review, because there's really not much I can say that hasn't already been said. I could address how Curley's wife is annoyingly only called Curley's wife despite being a main character, and the treatment she's given in the book‚Ä¶ but I think this is entirely because Steinbeck is showing her only from the point of view of his characters. This is further reinforced by an article I saw in which it discussed how he wrote to Claire Luce, the actress who originated the role on stage saying the following about the character: ""She is a nice, kind girl and not a floozy. No man has ever considered her as anything except a girl to try to make... As to her actual sex life ‚Äî she has had none except with Curley and there has probably been no consummation there since Curley would not consider her gratification and would probably be suspicious if she had any."" So I guess mission accomplished in showing how others viewed her, but also a bit of a failure if that was his real aim for the character (though I do love his jab at Curley there).

Will I read more Steinbeck in the future? Sure! I apparently like sliding down the rain slick precipice of despair, so why the hell not? 4/5 stars.

977,David Putnam,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Nov 19, 2013",5,"This is really a great read. Loved the story and the characters. But if you peel back all of that good stuff, I also found that the way the author endeared the reader to the main character, how that character won over the other kids was a brilliant study in leadership. How to earn respect. (Which, I think is missing more and more in our society today). That underlining leadership theme is really what carries the story. The recruitment, training and battles were just the way the author got that point across.
Highly recommend this book. (Not only for readers but for future leaders as well).

978,David,Lord of the Flies,"Jul 24, 2007",1,"I just don't buy it.

This book is famous for unmasking what brutes we are, just under the surface, but, well, for all the hype, it just isn't convincing. People--even teenage boys--just aren't as savage as Golding seems to want us to believe, and nothing in this book persuades me otherwise.

Perhaps if I'd gone to English boarding school I'd feel differently--but then that's the real irony of this book, that the brutality from which the British Empire was supposed to save so many people and cultures was in fact the Brits projecting their own savagery onto others.

But the rest of us, no, we aren't monsters underneath. A little messed up, maybe, a little more raw, but nowhere near the kind of brutes that Golding wants us to believe."

The Structure

I guess the real place to start with this book is with its structure. You may have noticed that the actual title is - The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure: The ""Good Parts"" Version Abridged by William Goldman.

Whew. That's a mouthful.

But that's also the genius of this book. You see, S. Morgenstern's ""Classic"" doesn't actually exist, only this abridged, ""Good Parts"" version, created wholly by William Goldman. This may not be the first time I expound upon the genius of this narrative.

The Princess Bride begins much like the movie. William Goldman gets sick and his father comes in to read him this story. Only in the book, we don't jump right into the story, we go to the future of Goldman's life where he talks about things that actually happened in his life, but also some thing's he's made up.

For instance, Goldman talks about writing for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which he did do. But he also talks about his fictional psychotherapist wife (that took some research). 

Finally, about 40 or so pages in, we get to the actual story. And it's almost exactly like the movie, or at least I should say that nothing is left out of the book that's in the movie (except the performances, but I'll get there). And that's how it should be, Goldman did write the screenplay.

During this time, Goldman explains that the book is actually extremely boring in parts and while he was young, his father only read the ""good parts."" Instead he skipped the pages and pages of explanations of Florintine (the actual story taking place in the fictional Florin) ancestry, which is also explained as Morgenstern being satiric. 

The story begins and just like in the movie, there are multiple interruptions, but in the book they're made as editorial notes. Again, this is where the genius of this setup comes in. He's able to comment on his own story, add things that the story alone cannot do, even point out things he finds odd...in his own story.

An example of Goldman pointing out what he finds odd is that throughout the story (not the editorial notes), there are always interruptions in the form of parentheticals. For instance:

""...she examined herself pore by pore in her mirror. (This was after mirrors.)""

""'I'll leave the lad an acre in my will,' Buttercup's father was fond of saying. (They had acres then.)""

""Then, rather than continue the argument (they had arguments then too), they would both turn on their daughter.""

These were found throughout the book and always made me laugh, but Goldman has an editorial note explaining that if the parentheticals bother you, you should skip them. 

The ""Good Parts"" and The Movie

If you're like me, you've seen the movie so many times that you can quote just about everything, and I'm terrible at quoting movies. 

The movie itself follows the book excellently and even exceeds the book in many ways. It's so very rare, but the already excellent characters such as Fezzik and the Man in Black are almost across the board improved upon in the movie.

I mean, how do you get any better than Andre the Giant and Billy Crystal's performance of Miracle Max? I was reading the exact same words that Crystal says, but it was almost flat in the book, whereas in the film, Crystal makes them come alive.

But the benefit of the book is, as usual, the fact that you get inside the character's heads and backstory. Before each of the famous ""fight"" scenes between The Man in Black and Buttercup's three kidnappers, we are let in on the backstory of each. These are great. 

We see what actually happened with 
Inigo
 and why he seeks revenge and becomes the greatest swordsman in the world...well,[Spoiler Alert] almost. We find out that 
Fezzik
 is even big for a Turk (who average 15 pound babies) and how he was a competitive fighter who had to learn how to lose to make the crowd like him. And best of all, it goes into his obsession with RHYMING! 

Then there's 
Vizzini
, the self-proclaimed genius and orchestrator of this most unstoppable team of the world's best.

Yet another thing I loved about this book, Goldman's obsessed with numbers and lists. Buttercup starts out as not even in the top 20 of the most beautiful women in the world, but quickly jumps to the top. Prince Humperdink is the best hunter in the world. Buttercup and Westley's kiss is better than the top 5 kisses ever had.

This just adds to the epic and fairytale feeling of the story, it can't get more noble than the best of the best, but at the same time, the whole numbering thing is just another comical aspect of Goldman's writing: the fact that people would even have a list or the ability to measure such things. I love it.

Do I need more examples of the genius of this work? The wit, the charm, the characters that are larger than life, this is easily one of my favorite books of all time.

5 out of 5 Stars (This wasn't even a debate)

Buttercup's Baby [The extra short story included in my edition of The Pricess Bride] 

Non-spoiler, tl;dr review: skip it, don't mess with the classic story.
(view spoiler)[

This is a short story and addition to the 30th anniversary edition of the book. I'm never a fan of these sorts of things. To be honest, it just messes with the purity that is the original and can leave you with a sour taste in your mouth. The Matrix (the movie) should have been left alone along with things like Ender's Game and Dune. It really is okay to leave people with a sense of wonder and imagination at what could have happened instead of milking things for all they're worth.

With that said, this wasn't a terrible addition, it was just unnecessary. It deals with the time after the ending of The Princess Bride when everyone lives ""happily ever after."" The first chapter is ""Fezzik Dies,"" so already you're world is shattered. 

Buttercup's baby is stolen and Fezzik is chasing the culprit, but then it never really goes back to this, it goes to a couple chapters that only slightly fit together (even admitted by Goldman), but which explains how they get to someone running away with Buttercup's baby.

Before this story is an explanation of how this story came about (in the fictional way, not an actual explanation) and it involves how Stephen King was actually going to do the abridgement, but left it up to Goldman. I guess I just don't get these parts.

I'm sure this is better for people who have read the story ages ago and come back to something new, but reading them all together just messed with the original too much. (hide spoiler)]"
981,Kylie D,The Book Thief,"Aug 19, 2018",5,"I have no words to describe this book. Brilliant? Wonderful? Amazing? All fall short, it's far more powerful than that. You'll just have to read it for yourselves..."
982,Tadiana ‚ú©Night Owl‚òΩ,Pride and Prejudice,"Jan 01, 2013",5,"Often imitated, never matched. Nobody can do it quite like Jane Austen.

True story: I was rummaging through and throwing away lots of my old papers and souvenirs a few weeks ago and happened to run across my 30+ year old notes from a college course where we studied Pride and Prejudice. I can't believe I still had them! Some of those P&P notes were actually pretty insightful, so in this review I've included some of the more interesting observations from my long-ago class. Hope you enjoy! (ETA: Now with bonus texts and memes)



From the first tongue-in-cheek words:It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.Austen brilliantly sets up the world of this novel. Marriage - however humorous the personalities and events may be - is serious business. And when the Bennets have five daughters and no sons, the seriousness of getting their girls married off increases exponentially. The desperation of the marriage hunt is really the desperation of economic survival. Mrs Bennet has that essentially right, however misguided she is in the way she goes about it. 

The theme of self-discovery works hand-in-hand with the theme of marriage, and the tension between economic interest and romantic feelings. Both pride and prejudice are obstacles not just to understanding others, but to knowing oneself. Elizabeth learns about herself from several other characters along the way: 

Wickham: (view spoiler)[the danger of trusting solely in appearance. (hide spoiler)]
Charlotte: (view spoiler)[the danger of too much practicality and making decisions based on material reasons. (hide spoiler)]
Lady Catherine: (view spoiler)[helps Elizabeth to see Darcy's pride in perspective (hide spoiler)]




Jane Austen shows us so many different types of marriages in P&P: those based mostly on initial physical attraction ((view spoiler)[the Bennet parents as well as Lydia and Wickham (hide spoiler)]), those based on practical, material considerations; those based on emotional feeling and compatibility ((view spoiler)[Jane and Bingley (hide spoiler)]). And finally, and very gradually, we progress to seeing relationships based on reason and intelligence as well as physical and emotional attraction. The Gardiners are the model here, and the type of marriage Elizabeth wants to have for herself.



I adore Elizabeth and Darcy, working through their flaws (there's pride and prejudice aplenty on both sides!), willing to reconsider earlier judgments, tentatively working their way toward each other. And when you combine that with Austen's insight into human foibles and her sharp wit, every page is a pleasure. Sometimes I've been guilty of rushing through P&P, skimming over some chapters to get to the ""good parts"" faster, but I took my time this time around, reading it slower and more carefully, and was rewarded accordingly.

P&P is my favorite book of Jane Austen's ... and very possibly my favorite book of all time. It's the perfect mix of intelligence, humor and romance.

Bonus! A studious and completely objective discussion of the merits of the leading actors and actresses in the major P&P movies and TV miniseries. 

First up: The Elizabeth Bennet actresses.

First, Greer Garson from the 1940 movie:

‚Ä¶ no, for two big reasons: 
1. As  one website points out, ‚ÄúGarson's [Elizabeth Bennet] was smirking, empty-headed and flirtatious where Ehle's was smirking, strong and intelligent."" Hah!
2. Hoop skirts. Hoop. Skirts. A thousand times no! 
(This movie also has a third strike against it, the travesty of its rewriting of Lady Catherine de Bourgh‚Äôs personality.)

Second, Elizabeth Garvie in the 1980 BBC miniseries: 

She‚Äôs not well known except among P&P fans, but she actually does a very nice job with Lizzie.

Jennifer Ehle from the 1995 miniseries:

She‚Äôs great, and she gets extra points for just how well she plays off of Colin Firth, but I have a fundamental problem with Ehle, which is that she just doesn‚Äôt match my vision of Lizzie. I just can‚Äôt entirely buy her in the part. 

Keira Knightley:

Very pretty but ‚Ä¶ too pretty. And man, is she wearing a lot of makeup in some of the scenes.


Honorable mention: Aishwarya Rai in Bride and Prejudice (I don‚Äôt even care if she‚Äôs too gorgeous):


So for me, it‚Äôs Elizabeth Garvie, but kind of in a default win. 

Part II: The Darcys:

We begin with Lawrence Olivier from the 1940 Hollywood movie:

... all props to Sir Lawrence, but he's not my vision of Darcy.

David Rintoul from the 1980 BBC version:

... who is a pretty good Darcy, actually; it's not his fault that the production values in this P&P version suck. (it's basically like watching a theater play that's been filmed)

On to the wonderful Colin Firth, from the seminal 1995 miniseries:

... I can't help it, he makes my heart beat faster even when he's not in a wet shirt.

Matthew Macfadyen in the 2005 movie:

Sorry to his fans, but he doesn't cut it for me. He always looks So. Worried!

So clearly for me it's Colin Firth FTW, but feel free to argue with me in the thread. :)

Honorable mentions go to Elliot Cowan in Lost in Austen and Martin Henderson in Bride and Prejudice. (Pics in the thread.)"

984,J.G. Keely,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Jul 06, 2009",3,"Writers who inspire a genre are usually misunderstood. Tolkien's reasons for writing were completely unlike those of the authors he inspired. He didn't have an audience, a genre, and scores of contemporaries. There was a tradition of high adventure fairy tales, as represented by Eddison, Dunsany, Morris, MacDonald, Haggard, and Kipling, but this was only part of what inspired Tolkien.

His writing was chiefly influenced by his familiarity with the mythological traditions of the Norse and Welsh cultures. While he began by writing a fairy story with The Hobbit and other early drafts, his later work became a magical epic along the lines of the Eddas. As a translator, Tolkien was intimately knowledgeable with these stories, the myths behind them, and the languages that underpinned them, and endeavored to recreate their form.

Contrarily, those who have followed in his footsteps since have tended to be inspired by a desire to imitate him. Yet they failed to do what Tolkien did because they did not have a whole world of mythic tradition, culture, and language to draw on. They mimicked his style, but did not understand his purpose, and hence produced merely empty facsimiles.

If they had copied merely the sense of wonder or magnificence, then they might have created perfectly serviceable stories of adventure, but they also copied those parts of Tolkien which do not fit a well-built, exciting story--like his work's sheer length. Tolkien made it 'okay' for writers of fantasy to produce books a thousand pages long, and to write many of them in succession. Yet Tolkien's length had a purpose, it was not merely an affectation.

Tolkien needed this length in order to reproduce myth. The Eddas were long and convoluted because they drew from many different stories and accounts, combined over time by numerous story-tellers and eventually compiled by scribes. The many digressions, conflicts, repetitions, asides, fables, songs, and minutiae of these stories came together organically. Each had a purpose, even if they didn't serve the story, they were part of a grand and strange world. Epics often served as encyclopedias for their age, teaching history, morals, laws, myth, and geography--as may be seen in Homer or The Bible.

This was the purpose of all of Tolkien's long, dull songs, the litany of troop movements, the lines of lineage, the snippets of didactic myths, and side-adventures. To create a realistically deep and complicated world, he felt he needed to include as many diverging views as the original myths had. He was being true to a literary convention--though not a modern one, and not one we would call a 'genre'.

He gave characters similar names to represent other historical traditions: that of common prefixes or suffixes, of a house line adopting similar names for fathers, sons, and brothers. An author who copies this style without that linguistic and cultural meaning just makes for a confusing story, breaking the sensible rule that main characters should not have similar names.

Likewise, in a well-written story, side-characters should be kept to the minimum needed to move the plot and entertain the reader with a variety of personalities. It is another rule Tolkien breaks, because he is not interested in an exciting, driving pace. He wants the wealth of characters to match the number of unimportant side characters one would expect from a historical text.

The only reason he sometimes gets away with breaking such sensible rules of storytelling is that he often has a purpose for breaking them, and is capable of drawing on his wealth of knowledge to instill further depth and richness in his world. Sometimes, when he slowed his story down with such asides, they did not have enough purpose to merit inclusion, a flaw in pacing which has only increased with modern authors.

But underneath all of that, Tolkien does have an appealing and exciting story to tell, of war and succession and moral struggles--the same sort of story that has been found in our myths since the very earliest writings of man. He does not create a straight monomyth, because, like Milton, he presents a hero divided. Frodo takes after the Adam, placing strength in humility and piety, not martial might or wit. Aragorn is an attempt to save the warlike, aristocratic hero whom Milton criticized in his portrayal of Satan.

Yet unlike Satan, we do not get an explanation of what makes Strider superior, worthy, or--more importantly--righteous. And in this, Tolkien's attempt to recreate the form of the Eddas is completely at odds with the Christian, romantic moral content with which he fills the story. This central schism makes his work much less true to the tradition than Anderson's 
The Broken Sword
, which was published the same year.

Not only does Tolkien put forth a vision of chaste, humble, 'everyman' heroes who persevere against temptation through piety, he also presents a world of dualistic good and evil, of eternal, personal morality, prototypical of the Christian worldview, particularly the post-Miltonic view. His characters are bloodless, chaste, and noble--and if that nobility is sometimes that of simple, hard-working folk, all the better for his Merrie England analogue.

More interesting than these is his portrayal of Gollum, one of the few characters with a deep psychological contradiction. In some ways, his central, conflicted role resembles Eddison's Lord Gro, whose work inspired Tolkien. But even this internal conflict is dualistic. Unlike Gro, Gollum is not a character with an alternative view of the world, but fluctuates between the hyperbolic highs and lows of Tolkien's morality.

It is unfortunate that both good and evil seem to be external forces at work upon man, because it removes much of the agency and psychological depth of the characters. There is a hint of very alien morality in the out-of-place episode of Tom Bombadil, expressing the separation between man and fairy that Dunsany's work epitomized. Bombadil is the most notorious remainder of the fantastical roots of Tolkien's story which he painstakingly removed in editing in favor of Catholic symbology.

Yet despite internal conflicts, there is something respectable in what he achieved, and no fantasy author has yet been capable of comprehending what Tolkien was trying to do and innovating upon it. The best modern writers of fantasy have instead avoided Tolkien, concentrating on other sources of inspiration. The dullards of fantasy have merely rehashed and reshuffled the old tropes back and forth, imagining that they are creating something.

One cannot entirely blame Tolkien because Jordan, Martin, Goodkind, Paolini, Brooks, and Salvatore have created a genre out of his work which is unoriginal, cloying, escapist, and sexually unpalatable (if often successful). At least when Tolkien is dull, ponderous, and divergent, he is still achieving something.

These authors are mostly trying to fix a Tolkien they don't understand, trying to make him easy to swallow. The uncomfortable sexuality is an attempt to repair the fact that Tolkien wrote a romance where the two lovers are thousands of miles apart for most of the story. Even a libertine like me appreciates Tolkien's chaste, distant, longing romance more than the obsessively fetishistic consummation that has come to define sexuality in the most repressive and escapist genre this side of four-color comic books.

I don't think Tolkien is a great writer, I don't even think he is one of the greater fantasy writers. He was a stodgy old Tory, and the Shire is his false golden age of 'Merrie Olde England'. His romance wasn't romantic, and his dualistic moralizing cheapened the story. His attempt to force Christian theology onto a heroic epic is as problematic and conflicted as monks' additions to Beowulf. 

Tolkien's flaws have been well-documented by notable authors, from Moorcock's 'Epic Pooh' to Mieville's adroit analysis, but for all that, he was no slouch. Even if we lament its stolid lack of imagination, The Lord of the Rings is the work of a careful and deliberate scholar of language, style, and culture. It is the result of a lifetime of collecting and applying knowledge, which is a feat to behold. 

Each time the moon is mentioned, it is in the proper phase as calculated from the previous instance. Calendar dates and distances are calculated. Every name mentioned has a meaning and a past. I have even heard that each description of a plant or stone was carefully researched to represent the progression of terrain, though I can find no support for this theory.

Yet what good is that to a story? It may be impressive as a thought exercise, but to put that much time and work into the details instead of fixing and streamlining the frame of the story itself seems entirely backwards to me. But for all that The Lord of the Rings may be dull, affected, and moralistic, it is Tolkien's, through and through.

My Fantasy Book Suggestions"
985,Kevin Kelsey,The Little Prince,"May 18, 2016",2,"Great observations, but personally I think it's overrated. It practically begs the reader to come to the conclusion that if you don't ""get it"" it's your own fault because you're a ""grown up, and only kids can see what matters."" It's heavy handed, clumsily executed observations on what's important in life. It's not wrong by any means, but it's kind of pseudo-intellectualist.

I'm going to go with a literal interpretation of the plot, because it's more fun that way: 

A man crashes his plane in the desert, hallucinates a small alien boy that teaches him philosophical lessons, invents a history for him, finds a well just in time to stave off dehydration, as he re-hydrates, his hallucinated alien friend kills himself and disappears, he fixes his plane and flies home and is sad about it, but feels blessed for the experience as it has changed him.


Ready for the moral? It's really simple:
 ""It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."" Or in other words, spend your time developing relationships, don't worry so much about the things, they're not important, it's the time you spend and how you spend it that is.

That's a nice philosophy, I get it. I even agree with it one hundred percent. I just think these metaphors are painfully clumsy."
986,Helena,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Aug 09, 2018",1,"Instead of bashing this book, I'm simply going to quote a post I saw because it put my thoughts into words:

 ""Japanese woman tells white American man about her past life as a geisha. White man then writes a novel that sells itself as an accurate memoir of Japanese woman's life, but instead falsifies a number of her life events, misrepresents her trade, and exoticises her culture. He also names her as a source even though she specifically asked him to keep her anonymous. Japanese woman gets death threats. White American man becomes bestselling author.

Then Japanese woman gets fed up and writes her own memoir to set the record straight. Meanwhile, white American man's book gets adapted into a film that grosses $162 million and wins three Oscars."""
987,may ‚ûπ,The Great Gatsby,"Nov 04, 2020",2,"the only thing I got from this is that Nick is gay

2.5"
988,Duane,The Outsiders,"Oct 03, 2014",5,"Occasionally a book is written at the perfect time, with the perfect story, with the perfect group of characters; and it is written with a passion and an insight that make it unique, that distinguishes it from any other book and any other story. And sometimes it defines a generation, or a culture or sub-culture of that generation. That, my friends, is what this book does. Is that what 15 year old Susan Eloise Hinton had in mind when she started to write this book? Probably not, but she was affected by what she saw in her 1965 Oklahoma high school; the presence of two rival gangs, the Greasers and the Socs. It inspired her to write a story, their story, and by doing so it resonated across a nation, across a generation, and it became what it is today, a symbol of that generation, and a classic in American literature."
989,Dem,Charlotte's Web,"Feb 21, 2019",4,"My 8 years old self  would have loved this book, I had been looking for an excuse to read this book for years and just realised on seeing it this week in a book shop that I didn't need an excuse to read it, I can just pick it up and indulge myself in little animal behaviour and so I enjoyed this beautiful story of a livestock pig named Wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named Charlotte. 

This book is so beautifully written and the illustrations in the copy I have just made it that much better. Friendship and love are the central themes of Charlotte's Web, This is a terrific children's book which I think many adults like myself will appreciate the story as well and I am going to hold on to this copy as I hope if the future (long distant future) to take it out again and perhaps read to my grand children.

I seem to have missed out on so many of these great books that I should have read as a child but as the saying goes "" better late than never"" and so nice to choose one to read every now and then."
990,Maura,The Da Vinci Code ,"Jul 30, 2007",1,"I've finally started reading that ever so controversial best-seller by Dan Brown. Actually, not reading it, listening to it while driving around Lansing, MI. This book seems to have changed the minds of many Catholics (my grandfather included) and Protestants alike. Granted, there have long been rumors of secret societies and organizations within the Roman Catholic Church, and historical cover-ups are rampant throughout civilization. 

HOWEVER,

The book is crap. It's not at all well written. Brown seems to feel that in order to impress the mystery of the supposed Holy Grail conspiracy upon his readers, he must be repetitive and condescending. It almost seems that the whole purpose of the book is to tell the world how much Brown knows about obscure art history and symbology, and that he is willing to explain it to the teeming masses of uniformed Christendom. His constant use of cliff-hanger chapter endings (almost every chapter) makes the novel read like it was originally intended as a serial publication. Much of Brown's story hinges upon the loss of the Sacred Feminine, and yet his main female character (a cryptologist for the French police) is constantly having to be led clue by clue to obvious conclusions by her quicker, more worldly, male counterparts.

I might have put some stock into Brown's ""history,"" he writes with conviction, if not much style. I may even have looked into some of his sources on my own. Today, though, Brown completely lost any stock I would have put into his actual knowledge. He referred, multiple times, to Jesus Christ as the Immaculate Conception. As every half-informed Catholic knows, Mary was the Immaculate Conception (conceived without sin), Jesus was the Miraculous Conception (conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit).

How this novel came to be as popular as it is, I can understand. Everyone today is dying to get to the big TRUTH, something which can never be done in religion. Faith is by definition something that is unsubstantiated, we must just believe. What I can't understand is how people can believe this absolute drivel."
991,Jayson,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ,"Aug 01, 2013",5,"(A) 86% | Extraordinary
Notes: It's a transitional book, which holds back its potential, but it adds greatly to its mythos with excellent new characters."
992,Candi,Anne of Green Gables,"Jun 20, 2018",5,"""Excitement hung around Anne like a garment, shone in her eyes, kindled in every feature.""

Oh, what sheer pleasure it was to spend just a moment in time with Anne and her delightful companions in this little classic. What pure joy to catch a glimpse of the beauty of Prince Edward Island. I am likely one of the last persons on earth‚Ä¶ well, on Goodreads at least‚Ä¶ to read this novel. What in the world was I waiting for?! As a child and adolescent, I wrongly assumed that this book would be of no interest to me. I wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äògirly girl‚Äô and surely this was written for ‚Äòthat sort‚Äô of reader, right? Wrong! By the time I was old enough to know better, I thought I had grown too mature in years to pick this one up. Wrong again. The ‚Äòsort‚Äô of reader that this does appeal to however: one who appreciates exquisite writing and vibrant characters, one who relishes being steeped in another time and place, and one who enjoys an all-out fantastic story. In short, this book should satisfy nearly everyone!

You can‚Äôt help but fall in love with Anne. She is the friend you have always longed for, the daughter that will bring that much-needed light in your life, that student that any teacher would be proud to instruct. She is funny, imaginative, bright, and a regular chatterbox. She laments about her red hair, apologizes for being a ‚Äògreat trial‚Äô to Marilla, and always manages to see the positive in most everything. However, she does maintain a long-standing rivalry with her peer, Gilbert Blythe. ""She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves."" Nothing is ever lukewarm when it comes to Anne‚Äôs feelings. 

There were moments I wanted to laugh with her and moments when I wanted to cry. When she first arrived at Green Gables, Anne learned that it had all been a mistake. For, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert meant to adopt a young boy to help with the chores. A little girl was not needed. It nearly crushed me when Anne fell in love with Green Gables only to find that she must surely be turned away and carted straight back to the orphanage. ""Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are? They‚Äôre always laughing‚Ä¶ I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it again."" What transpires after this will melt even the most hardened hearts.

Some might say this book is too wholesome, too charming, and perhaps too unrealistic. I have to say that I don‚Äôt believe those are good enough reasons to skip reading this enchanting novel! It didn‚Äôt take place just yesterday so I didn‚Äôt expect the trials and tribulations of today‚Äôs day and age. The events do occur on an idyllic island, so I felt the beautiful scenery I was immersed in was wholly believable. Anne is not a perfect little girl and each character has their share of flaws. Not every story has to be full of doom and gloom to get all the stars! Sometimes one just needs to sit back, relax, and just surrender to the small pleasures in life. We could all use a lesson from Anne‚Äôs book of optimism here and there!

""Dear old world, you are lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you."""
993,Vit Babenco,Of Mice and Men,"Apr 12, 2013",5,"Of Mice and Men is a tale about the ultimate kindness - it is hard to talk about kindness without turning sentimental but John Steinbeck was the one who really could.
His ear heard more than what was said to him, and his slow speech had overtones not of thought, but of understanding beyond thought.
Simple-minded men of this cruel world live in their own dreamlands and they dream of rainbows."
994,Tadiana ‚ú©Night Owl‚òΩ,Of Mice and Men,"Jun 20, 2014",4,"I think I've been avoiding John Steinbeck, consciously or subconsciously, ever since I was a horse-loving teenager and thought that The Red Pony would be a nice, pleasant book to read.

  

I didn't read any Steinbeck books for years.

But I was in the local library, puttering around in the general fiction shelves, and happened to pull this one out and noticed how short it was--only 107 pages. I had just finished reading Jonathan Livingston Seagull, which was a 127-page overdose of cheesy 70's inspiration, and it occurred to me that by reading this book to offset JLS I could restore the cosmic balance in my life, or something like that.

Lennie and George are a unique pair of friends: George is restless, intelligent and often short-tempered; Lennie is huge and incredibly strong, although mentally damaged. He has a childlike sweetness but is easily confused and frightened, and that combined with his strength makes him threatening to others. Somehow, despite their differences, the two have formed a friendship. George tries to protect Lennie from the world . . . and the world from Lennie. It's a difficult task. But they have their dreams and plans of a place of their own, where they can tend a garden and raise animals. And Lennie can take care of the rabbits. It's the most heavenly thing he can imagine.

George and Lennie are hired as field hands at a ranch in California, and the foreshadowings of disaster start to come thick and fast. An old sheepdog whose usefulness has passed is unceremoniously shot. The owner's son Curley comes around to their bunkhouse, spoiling for a fight. Curley's young, bored wife comes around even more often, looking for a different kind of trouble. The hands are sure that they only need a month or two of wages to achieve their plans of a place of their own, but the best-laid schemes of mice and men gang oft agley.

I was expecting to read about shattered dreams, but I was surprised and touched by the strength of the theme of true friendship--not just the friendship between George and Lennie, but also the friendship and understanding offered by Slim, the ranch foreman. With all of the loneliness and cruelty and loss and disappointment that life can bring, it's this one message of hope that I choose to take away from this short but powerful book."
995,Juushika,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Mar 26, 2008",2,"Memoirs of a Geisha is an American novel, and as such the attempt at West does East, especially on the complex and delicate subject of the geisha, is compelling, interesting, but also heavy-handed and ultimately ineffective (even more so in the case of the film). It is a wonderful introduction to geisha, Japanese culture, and the East for the uninitiated Western reader, and I can see why the book is popular, but I found it disappointing. For the reader already familiar with the culture, western influences are all too clear and the book comes off as a bit clunky and imperfect. I also had some problems with the general perception of the characters by readers versus the way the characters were actually portrayed in the book--Memoirs is far from the good-willed fairy tale that people assume it is. By all means, read it, but leave it open for critique and remember that a more authentic representation of eastern culture, especially in the details, will come from the east itself.

A lot of my critique stems from the fact that this movie has attained such wide-spread fame and been made into a movie, to be sure. I feel like it is being perpetuated as something it is not. Even the introduction to the book (a faux translator's note) perpetuates the myth that Memoirs is an accurate, beautiful, in-depth reflection of the life of a geisha, when in truth it is no more that historical fiction and is written by an outsider. Golden has done his research and is well-educated on his subjects, and I have no problem with people reading from, taking interest in, and even learning from this book; I do, however, think it is important that readers don't conflate the American novel with Japanese reality. They aren't the same thing, no matter how much research Golden did, and if we take the book as an accurate representation we're actually underestimating and undervaluing geisha, Japan, and Japanese culture.

Because Golden attempts to write from within the geisha culture, as a Japanese woman, he must do more than report the ""facts"" of that life--he must also pretend to be a part of it. Pretend he does, acting out a role as if he has studied inflection, script, and motivation. He certainly knows what makes writing ""Japanese"" but his attempt to mimic it is not entirely successful. The emphasis on elements, the independent sentences, the visual details are too prevalent and too obvious, as if Golden is trying to call our attention to them and thus to the Japanese style of the text. He does manage to draw attention, but to me, at least, what I came away with was the sense that Golden was an American trying really hard to sound Japanese--that is, the effect betrayed the attempt and the obvious attempt ruined the sincerity of the novel, for me. I felt like I was being smacked over the head with beauty! wood! water! kimono! haiku! and I felt insulted and disappointed.

The problems that I saw in the text were certainly secondary to the purpose of the text: to entertain, to introduce Western readers to Japanese culture, and to sell books (and eventually a film). They may not be obvious to all readers and they aren't so sever that the book isn't worth reading. I just think readers need to keep in mind that what Golden writes is fiction. Historical fiction, yes, but still fiction, therefore we should look for a true representation of Japanese culture within Japanese culture itself and take Memoirs with a grain of salt.

I also had problems with the rushed end of the book, the belief that Sayuri is a honest, good, modest, generous person when she really acts for herself and at harm to others throughout much of the book, the perpetuation of Hatsumomo as unjustified and cruel when she has all the reason in the world, and in general the public belief that Memoirs is some sort of fairy tale when in fact it is heavy-handed, biased, and takes a biased or unrelatistic view toward situations, characters, and love. However, all of those complains are secondary, in my view, to the major complain above, and should be come obvious to the reader.

Memoirs goes quickly, is compelling, and makes a good read, and I don't want to sound too unreasonably harsh on it. However, I believe the book has a lot of faults that aren't widely acknowledged and I think we as readers need to keep them in mind. This is an imperfect Western book, and while it may be a fun or good book it is not Japanese, authentic, or entirely well done."
996,Larissa,Wuthering Heights,"Oct 21, 2007",4,"Certain novels come to you with pre-packaged expectations. They just seem to be part of literature's collective unconscious, even if they are completely outside of your own cultural referents. I, for instance, who have no particular knowledge of--or great love for--romantic, Anglo-Gothic fiction, came to Wuthering Heights with the assumption that I was picking up a melancholy ghost story of thwarted, passionate love and eternal obsession. Obsession turned out to be only accurate part of this presumption. 

Having an image of Heathcliff and Cathy embracing 
Gone with the Wind
-style on a windy moor ironed in my mind, I was almost completely unprepared for the hermetic, moribund, bleak, vengeful, perverse, and yes--obsessive--novel that this really is. Don Quixote is not about windmills and Wuthering Heights is not really a love story. Heathcliff and Cathy's love affair (if it can be called that) is a narcissistic (""I am Heathcliff!"" Cathy exclaims at one point), possessive, and imminently cruel relationship predicated on self-denial and an obsessiveness that relies not on passion, but rather borders on hatred. They are selfish, violent, and contriving people who have borne their fair share of abuses (mostly Heathcliff in this respect) and in turn, feel no compunction about raining similar abuses on those who they find beneath them.

Given this dynamic, it seems perhaps inevitable that these two characters would make not only themselves miserable, but everyone around them miserable--even after death. This is particularly easy to accomplish mainly because there are--with the exception of Mr. Lockwood, the tenant who rents a home from Heathcliff--no outside characters. Everyone in the novel (including the servants) is isolated, trapped between the same two homes, with the same two families, and have truly no chance of escaping any of the events and repercussions that occur.(One character makes a temporary escape, only to suffer all the more for it later.) 

More important, however, is the fact that Heathcliff and Cathy don't even need be present (although they usually are in some fashion) for their influences to be felt by the other characters. The sins of the father, are literally, inherited and distributed among the next generation. The children of Wuthering Heights are not only physical doubles of their parents (At least 3 characters look like Cathy, and one resembles Heathcliff), but they are also spiritual stand-ins. They must suffer for past transgressions, and they must find a way to make amends for them. All, I might add, without the particular benefit of ever having the full story, the context that might be necessary to actually change their circumstances. Misery, it seems, is inevitable. 

There is, of course, much more to be said about this novel. One could spend quite some time dissecting all the various repetitions and doublings, the narrative structure (the story is told by the housekeeper to the lodger who then writes it down as a diary entry), or the archetypal analogies and semi-biblical symbolism that seems to be implicit to every part of this story. 

The point being, I suppose, that while Wuthering Heights may not be the wistful romance one (or maybe just I) expected to be, it is a particularly satisfying one for all of its dark and layered surprises."
997,Nataliya,The Hunger Games ,"Dec 07, 2010",4,"Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. 
Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows. 

 

Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 


Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
‚ÄúBut just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.‚Äù 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl. 

 

And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)

** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)

*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 


 

Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  

Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah...

...Rue...Oh, Rue... 

Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose (view spoiler)[death scene (hide spoiler)] brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. 

Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.
----------
I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------

EDITED TO ADD:
 
So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness.

 I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). 
First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* 
The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... 

PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*"

 Original Review:

I read this book a couple of years ago and, for some unknown reason, never continued on. It was just as wonderfully magical as I remembered, a breath of fresh air during what is usually a stressful time of year for me. I have yet to find a story that feels so pure and childlike that appeals to such a broad range of people. There‚Äôs something for everyone here; whether you are 10 or 100, Hogwarts is a place you can escape to and enjoy hearty adventures that you won‚Äôt find elsewhere. 

I truly love all of the characters and feel the entire cast is well done, but my personal favorites are the Weasley twins, Hagrid, and Professor McGonnall. While I‚Äôve seen all the movies and know the general storyline, I‚Äôm really excited to experience the story ‚Äúfirst hand‚Äù and see what all was left out from the films. I‚Äôm also intrigued to find out more about each house, especially the ones that took a backseat in this story. Not sure if I can say anything that hasn‚Äôt been said before, but I loved it! 

Buddy read with Sam of Clues and Reviews!"

1002,Lyn,The Book Thief,"Jun 08, 2013",4,"Very good.

Having Death as the narrator and having as a central protagonist a young girl in Nazi Germany make The Book Thief by Markus Zusak stand out from the crowd of books about Europe during World War II; this book is good not so much because of the story, but how the author tells it. 

In the Book Thief, Zusak uses a rich, multi-layered blend of allegory, metaphor and symbolism to create amidst the dirt and depression of Germany during the late 30s and 40s a stark vision of historical and philosophical thoughtfulness. This international best seller features a healthy sense of dramatic irony, with the German setting and the strong use of script-like construction becoming reminiscent, vaguely, of Bertold Brecht, especially the sympathetic depiction of Marxists. 

By using a surreal personification as a narrator, the author has softened the blow of the harsh setting and thus, incredibly, makes the characters more accessible and makes the reader approach an empathy with them that may otherwise be unavailable. I am reminded of Anthony Burgess‚Äô comments about A Clockwork Orange and how he created the Nadsat language not just to add depth to his narration, but also to minimize the brutality of his story. In much the same way, Zusak has used Death as a narrator to ironically assuage the viciousness of the everyday life that Liesel and the Hubermanns experience in their quiet section of Nazi extremism.

Death is not just a narrator but also one of the characters. Telling a story from his vantage, about a group of Germans on Himmel (Heaven) Street amidst the moral flagellation of the Third Reich Zusak creates a fecundity of symbolic structure. I found myself getting lost in metaphoric possibilities. What did he mean by that? What could that symbolize? Yet the author does not over generalize or make universal declarations, his approach is far more subtle, and again Brechtian in it‚Äôs demystification for dramatic realism; the reader comes to know Liesel Meminger, not as an ultra-real snapshot, nor as a idealized German everygirl, but as an actress in a play, knowable and probable, but still a dramatic portrayal. Through the eyes of Death, Liesel enters from stage left and we follow her through stereotypical misadventures made hackneyed in the World War II genre, but also through the good, the bad, and the ugly that is histrionic enough to be believable and understandable as an expression of real life during Nazi Germany. 

This is still, though, after all, a representative portrayal of an ugly time. The reader should not look for a Disney moment, there are few. Zusak peppers his chronicle with some scenes of comic relief, but he never lets you forget when and where the action takes place. Expectations of Hollywood commercial breaks will come and go unnoticed on this trip; and all to the credit of its creator, who has crafted that most rare of accomplishments: a commercial success and at the same time an artistic expression.

A very singular literary experience and an enjoyable journey with a young writer from whom we have much to expect."
1003,shady boots,The Fault in Our Stars,"Jan 10, 2012",0,"Hang on a sec.

I'm gonna leave the rating blank now, cause I feel like I wouldn't have given this book five stars had I read it today. Yeah, it definitely impacted me once upon a time, but now... I've read so many unbelievably emotional books that this one just seems to, quite frankly, fade into the background. I've read a handful of eye-opening reviews and analyses that have made me see this book in a new light. A dimmer light, sadly.

Sorry to disappoint the people who liked my former review, where I claimed that this book was so ""heart-destroying"" and whatnot. That was my younger self being overly dramatic, I think."
1004,She-Who-Reads,Fahrenheit 451,"Jul 11, 2007",5,"Somehow, I have gotten through life as an English major, book geek, and a science-fiction nerd without ever having read this book. I vaguely remember picking it up in high-school and not getting very far with it. It was an interesting premise, but far too depressing for my tastes at the time.

Fast-forward 15 years later. I just bought a copy the other day to register at BookCrossing for their Banned Books Month release challenge. The ALA celebrates Banned Books Week in September, so one BXer challenged us to wild release books that had at one point or another been banned in this country during the entire month. Fahrenheit 451 fits the bill -- an irony that is not lost on anyone, I trust. (Everyone knows Fahrenheit 451 is about the evils of censorship and banning books, right? The title refers to the temperature at which paper burns.)

I didn't intend to start reading it. I really didn't. Somehow it seduced me into it. I glanced at the first page and before I knew it, it was 1:00 in the morning and I was halfway through with the thing. It's really good! No wonder it's a modern classic. Montag's inner emotional and moral journey from a character who burns books gleefully and with a smile on his face to someone who is willing to risk his career, his marriage, his house, and eventually his life for the sake of books is extremely compelling. That this man, product of a culture that devalues reading and values easy, thoughtless entertainments designed to deaden the mind and prevent serious thought, could come to find literature so essential that he would kill for it...! Something about that really spoke to me.

It raises the question: why? What is it about books, about poetry, about literature that is so essential to us? There is no doubt in my mind that it is essential, if not for all individuals (although I find it hard to imagine life without books, I know there are some people who don't read for pleasure, bizarre as that seems to me), then for society. Why should that be? Books don't contain any hard-and-fast answers to all of life's questions. They might contain great philosophical Truths, but only subjectively so -- there will always be someone who will argue and disagree with whatever someone else says. In fact, as Captain Beatty, the evil fire chief, points out, no two books agree with each other. What one says, another contradicts. So what, then, is their allure? What is it that made Mildred's silly friend start to weep when Montag read the poem ""Dover Beach"" aloud to her? Where does the power of literature come from?

I think the reason that books are so important to our lives and to the health of our society -- of any society -- is not because they give us answers, but because they make us ask the questions. Books -- good books, the books that stay with you for years after you read them, the books that change your view of the world or your way of thinking -- aren't easy. They aren't facile. They aren't about surface; they're about depth. They are, quite literally, thought-provoking. They require complexity of thought. They require effort on the part of the reader. You get out of a book what you put into the reading of it, and therefore books satisfy in a way that other types of entertainment do not.

And they aren't mass-produced. They are individual, unique, gloriously singular. They are each an island, much-needed refuges from an increasingly homogeneous culture.

I'm glad I read Fahrenheit 451, even if the ending was rather bleak. It challenged me and made me think, stimulated me intellectually. We could all do with a bit of intellectual stimulation now and then; it makes life much more fulfilling."
1005,Stephanie,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Oct 18, 2007",5,"This book is beautiful. It is a classic teenager read. I have probably read this book a million times and it never gets old. I love how honest and deep Charlie is. He will get you thinking about the good things and what really matters in life. I am inspired whenever I read this book and I hope you can get as much out of it as I do each and every time. 
This is was my book report for school. Hope it helps!


‚ÄúWe are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose wherever we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.‚Äù (pg.211) Every word spoken by Charlie has touched my heart. I love how honest and deep Charlie is. He will get you thinking about the good things and what really matters in life. I am inspired whenever I read this book.
Written by Stephen Chbosky, The Perks of Being a Wallflower would have to be one of the most insightful young adult novels I have read. It‚Äôs a collection of letters written by a boy who calls himself Charlie. He writes ‚Äúto know that someone out there listens and understands and doesn‚Äôt try to sleep with people even if they could have. (He) need(s) to know that these people exist.‚Äù (pg.2) 
This books talks about drugs, sex, sexuality, literature, films, music, and daily adolescent life. The main character, Charlie, a freshman in the early 1990‚Äôs, is just beginning high school like all of us. Following his meeting with Sam and Patrick, two seniors who become his best friends, Charlie begins to experience more of life. He was always more of the shy understanding type who would ‚Äúuse thought to not participate in life.‚Äù (pg.24)
""The world of first dates and mix tapes, family dramas and new friends, the world of sex, drugs and the rocky horror picture show, when all you need is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite‚Ä¶"" (Back cover) When I read certain books, or certain lines I can get the chills. Not just ‚Äúoh that I was so good I got the chills‚Äù but the true hair raising shiver with a small sweep of coldness, chills. That line does it for me. ‚ÄúAnd in that moment, I swear we were infinite."" (pg.39) If these lines have no affect on you, I do not recommend reading this book. It‚Äôs for the thinkers as well as the participators. It‚Äôs for the ones who enjoy simplicity and want to widen and better their point of view. Don‚Äôt take me wrong though, everyone should read it, but at their own time.
This book has inspired me to try and do so much more. Charlie did and achieved so much in just his freshman year alone. I want to live a life like him. One that I can look back and be proud of, one that I can tell my kids about, of walking home from school and spending the best times with my friends. To you, right now in this classroom it may seem little and petty, but to Charlie and I, this is real. After reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I assure you that Charlie will be with you forever."
1006,A,The Fault in Our Stars,"Aug 12, 2012",1,"Update (25/06/2014)-

Since I've been receiving a lot of cyber bullies and hate messages, I‚Äôm going to clarify few things.

-Firstly, this is a negative review of the book and it has got a lot of potential to infuriate the fans. If you think that your opinion is the only opinion that exists on earth and that no one should dislike your favourite book, then I would suggest you to avoid this review.

-Stop harassing me. Why can't you get it through your thick skulls that everyone has different opinions, they‚Äôre going to interpret books differently from you and stop being selfish to think that just because you loved a book that means the whole world should love it. This world is full of people with differing opinions, differing thoughts and differing likes and differing dislikes, learn to respect them even if you don‚Äôt agree with what they have to say about your favourite books. Just because you love a particular book that I hate doesn't make you a good person and me a bad person, It simply shows that people like different things. 

Every reader has the freedom to dissect and critically analyse any book and write their thoughts on it in their own review space without the fear of anyone (or fans bossing them into writing what the fandom wants). Critically analysing books and criticising problematic aspects of any reading material prevents people from being passive readers.Shakespeare and J.K Rowling too have their own share of critics then what makes Green‚Äôs book flawless that it‚Äôs not allowed to be criticised? 

-Stop cyber bullying and trolling me. Your hate messages and death threats will show much more of your personality than your love for this book. Remember, every time you comment any bullshit here, you‚Äôre giving your own fandom a bad name and my review more popularity. Also, your hate messages aren't going to put me down. I‚Äôm a strong girl and I‚Äôm always going to stand up for what I believe in come hell or high water. I don't fear anyone and no one can ever force me to follow their orders like a puppet especially not a fandom where most of the fans are immature cyber bullies who can‚Äôt respect other‚Äôs opinions. Also, I've caught fans making fake accounts to troll my review, this shows me that they are big cowards who hide their faces and send me spiteful comments.

-Lastly, I‚Äôm NOT shaming anyone for loving this book. You can love whatever you want to and believe in whomever you want to. I have no problem with people who genuinely love this book; I have problems with those who think readers should not have the rights to express their dislike for any book, I have problems with those who approve of and participate in cyber bullying reviewers who write negative reviews on their favourite books, I have problems with those who refuse to acknowledge the fact that their favourite books can have flaws and not everyone‚Äôs going to love them, I have problems with those who come here to shove their opinions down my throat. Do you find anyone who hated this book shoving their opinions in comments of positive reviews? Then what makes you think that you have the rights to troll negative reviews?

Alright, now let's begin with the review.

**WARNING- MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD**
 

EXPECTATION-







REALITY-






So I happily bought the hardcover of The Fault in our stars back in December 2012 after seeing the high average GR ratings and raving reviews saying how beautiful, life-changing, thought-provoking and blah blah it is. Surprisingly, this book was so special that it became the first book that I slammed on the wall twice after reading it. It didn‚Äôt only disappoint me but also angered me. I'm surprised to find that harsh critics are swallowing up this trash and calling it a masterpiece. Ugh! 

I‚Äôm going to make a list of everything I hate about this book that earned it the topmost place on my list of Worst books ever.


The characters-
 Hazel and Augustus are the flattest cardboard cut-outs I have ever seen in any book. Both of them were like 60-years-old stuck in some teenager's bodies making them very boring and unlikable. Hazel was such an annoying, stupid and pretentious Mary Sue that I wanted to punch her right in the face. One great example of her stupidity-

‚ÄùWhy are breakfast foods breakfast foods...Like, why don‚Äôt we have curry for breakfast?‚Äù

""A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault.
But a hot boy . . . well."" 

Augustus and Hazel have the same boring, pretentious, know-it-all and indistinguishable personality. Hazel is the female version of Augustus (no, I‚Äôm not going to call him affectionately with Gus) and he is the male version of Hazel. These two characters meld together and have no depth at all. I couldn‚Äôt connect with them, I felt no pain and sympathy for them and they annoyed me so much that I wanted to stab them.
 

Romance-
 It fell from the sky. Seriously, I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù about the relationship between them. They both fall in love within seconds just after laying eyes on each other 
~love at first sight~
. The romance is undeveloped and it comes from nowhere. I was baffled when Hazel accepted to go to Augustus's house just minutes after meeting him. WHAT THE HELL? How stupid can you be? You fall for a guy's words whom you met just few minutes ago and agree to go to his house! What if he were a murderer or rapist? 

Not to mention that the kissing scene in Anne Frank's house was so effing disgusting. Anne Frank's house is considered to be a place of remembrance, a place where 2 families hid during the dark days of Holocaust. If anyone makes out at such a revered site, they would be kicked out regardless of who or what they are. People present around will be disgusted, they won't stand and watch much less clap for the ""lovely"" couple.


Writing-
 Cheesy. Emotionless. Terrible. Want to hear some favourite quotes of mine? 

‚ÄúMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.‚Äù...Why compare your thoughts to stars and constellations? *sighs*

""Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.""



 ""That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.""...Yeah, that‚Äôs the thing about chocolate, it demands to be eaten.

 ‚ÄùI'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.‚Äù 

(view spoiler)[
  


(hide spoiler)] 

‚ÄúThere will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever.‚Äù

Me-


There were senseless dialogues, brain-cell burning metaphors and words thrown around in the book from the dictionary. I‚Äôll stop here because just thinking about them gives me an awful migraine. 

And you know what? Teenagers living in the 21st century DON'T speak like that. No teen can spontaneously come up with long monologues within seconds. Also, genuinely sick teenagers don‚Äôt have the luxury to be so witty and clever every single time. One thing I don't buy is that teens with cancer suddenly become magically wise. They become terrified, confused, depressed and angry. They DON‚ÄôT magically gain great insight in life and go around puking long monologues about the meaning of life. This book made me roll my eyes in disgust. 


(UPDATE- In response to gazillion questions and arguments I've been getting on the paragraphs above, I have written a detailed explanation below)***



Plot-
 Predictable. Boring. Uninspiring. Put me to sleep. I had to plough through the whole book. Cancer is hard, it's painful but this book didn‚Äôt show me that. I couldn‚Äôt feel Hazel and Augustus‚Äô struggle against it. I couldn‚Äôt feel their pain. TFioS is nothing but a cheesy romance novel.

Me throughout the book-



""He died eight days after his prefuneral""
WHAT THE HELL?? Green tried to make his death sound LIKE HE WENT TO A PARTY LAST WEEK!!!

Ok, so this book made you cry, right? If a book makes you cry it doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs a masterpiece. I can understand that you must‚Äôve felt sad and sympathetic for the characters and must‚Äôve cried but considering that this novel is sad and it made you cry doesn‚Äôt make it an awesome, life-changing and beautiful story. I cried after reading Allegiant for days but I hated that book with burning passion, it was one of the worst books I ever read. 

Before you start calling me a cold-hearted bitch for hating and criticising this book, let me tell you that if you think you have every right to go around fangirling how wonderful this book was then I believe that I have every right to express my hatred for it whether you like it or not.

*** I never mentioned or implied that teenagers are illiterate or can't have a large vocabulary, don't accuse me of something I haven't said. I just find it hard to believe that any teen can come up with nonsensical monologues like the ones below or think it's appropriate to use them in their conversations-

""I‚Äôm awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard‚Äù 
‚ÄúThat kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphysical resonances of human waste production‚Äù. (wtf?!)

It's hard to believe that anyone would talk like that in a normal conversation every single time.
I am a teen and I go to high school, I know many other teens of my age who have developed a large vocabulary and have brilliant writing skills. That is simply because they love reading and have developed the habit of learning new words from the dictionary from a very young age. They write amazing poems and honestly, it takes them a lot of time to ponder over and make their metaphors or poems perfect. They obviously cannot open their mouth and spontaneously say
""My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations"".

Btw, none of the teenage characters from this book show any interest in reading high literature and poetry (the only book Hazel claims to read is An Imperial Affliction) then what's the reason behind their ability to spew pretentious monologues? They aren't geniuses, they aren't teens who read avidly or analyse high literature and show interest in oratory, existentialist philosophy and poetry. Therefore, it's not plausible for them to speak with profound words. I would believe their monologues had they shown interest in Kant, Sartre, Nietzsche and Heidegger.

Now going over the cigarette metaphor, Augustus buys a pack of cigarettes regularly just so he could put one in his mouth and not light it thus, giving us another stupid dialogue ""It's a metaphor. You keep the killing thing between your teeth but don't give it the power to kill you"". Funny that he won't kill himself by lighting up the cigarette but will regularly give money to an industry that is the largest cause of cancer thus, promoting the cigarette industry and indirectly killing others. (What a genius!) Not to mention that he mocks Hazel's cancer right on her face and guess her reaction? She's impressed and readily approves of and participants in his metaphor.

There's a lot of difference between being wise and being pretentious and Hazel and Augustus are the latter. I don't buy their dialogues because they are extremely ridiculous and cheesy and no argument by fans and authors can change my opinion because Green makes no effort in making the dialogues IN THE BOOK seem plausible. There's no reason for their large vocabulary and ability to spew long monologues IN THE BOOK. I've read Green's post on Augustus' character being pretentious and imo, he misses the point that his characters are not only pretentious; they are extremely unrealistic as well. Augustus' pretension is not ""an intentional flaw"", it's simply poor characterisation.

I'm not saying that kids with cancer cannot be intelligent. A lot of fans say that the characters in the book are special and wise because they have cancer and this book tries hard to show that too. I merely said that having cancer does not mean that you can automatically become wise and gain a lot of knowledge. 

I couldn't sympathise with the characters and feel their pain. That doesn't mean that I'm cold hearted. It's not my fault that I couldn't get emotionally connected to the characters, it's the authors fault for not writing characters I could sympathise with. It's the author's fault for making shallow, judgemental and annoying characters. It's the his fault for making characters with personality that mocks cancer patients and who show disrespect to millions of people who died in the Holocaust. It's the author's fault for romanticising cancer and using it as a ploy to sell his book. I'm NOT hating people who have cancer, I'm NOT hating the characters because they have cancer. I'm hating them for who they are. I'm hating the book because it's poorly written. 

I don't need to have cancer to analyse this book. Having cancer does not mean that you get the rights to say whatever you want to about this book. Every reader whether sick or not has equal rights to analyse and voice their opinions freely on any book.

1008,Emily May,Wuthering Heights,"Feb 09, 2011",5,"This is my favourite book. I do not say that lightly - I've read quite a lot from all different genres - but this is my favourite book. Of all time. Ever. The ladies over at The Readventurer kindly allowed me to get my feelings of utter adoration for Wuthering Heights off my chest in their ""Year of the Classics"" feature, but I now realise it's time I posted a little something in this blank review space. I mean, come on, it's my favourite book so it deserves better than empty nothingness.

So, what do I love so much about Wuthering Heights? Everything. Okay, maybe not. That wouldn't really be saying it strongly enough.

What I love about this novel is the setting; the wilderness. This is not a story about niceties and upper class propriety. This is the tale of people who aren't so socially acceptable, who live away from the strict rules of civilization - it's almost as if they're not quite from the world we know. The isolation of the setting out on the Yorkshire moors between the fictional dwellings of The Heights and Thrushcross Grange emphasises how far removed these characters are from social norms, how unconventional they are, and how lonely they are.

This is a novel for readers who can appreciate unlikeable characters; readers who don't have to like someone to achieve a certain level of understanding of them and their circumstances. People are not born evil... so what makes them that way? What torments a man so much that he refuses to believe he has any worth? What kind of person digs up the grave of their loved one so they can see them once again? Heathcliff was not created to be liked or to earn your forgiveness. Emily Bront√´ simply tells his story from the abusive and unloved childhood he endured, to his obsession with the only person alive who showed him any real kindness, to his adulthood as an angry, violent man who beats his wife and imprisons the younger Cathy in order to make her marry his son.

It would be so easy to hate Heathcliff, and I don't feel that he is some dark, sexy hero like others often do. But I appreciate what Emily Bront√´ attempts to teach us about the cycle of violence and aggression. Heathcliff eventually becomes little more than the man he hates. By being brought up with beatings and anger he in turn unleashes it on everyone else. And Cathy is no delicate flower either. What hope did Heathcliff have when the only person he ever loved was so selfish and vindictive? But I love Emily Bront√´ for creating such imperfect, screwed-up characters.

This is a dark novel that deals with some very complicated people, but I think in the end we are offered the possibility of peace and happiness through Cathy (younger) and Hareton's relationship, and the suggestion that Cathy (older) and Heathcliff were reunited in the afterlife. I had an English teacher in high school that said Cathy and Heathcliff's personalities and their relationship were too much for this world and that peace was only possible for them in the next. I have no idea if this was something Ms Bronte intended, but the romantic in me likes to imagine that it's true.

1009,Laura,The Giving Tree,"Jul 13, 2007",1,"Easily the most vile children's book ever written, for reasons eloquently stated by about a zillion other posters here. I remember my grandmother, whom I disliked (yeah, some kids don't like their grandparents, it's true) used to push this book on me as terribly DEEP and BEAUTIFUL and something I should really THINK ABOUT. And you wonder why I didn't like my grandmother? (My mother thought it was a piece of shit, too.) Anyway, it's a vomitous book, always has been, and I'm glad there are other people who think that it is. When I was a kid, it was held up as the ne plus ultra of depth and beauty in children's literature. God help us if that's true, but luckily it isn't. If you want a proper story about self-sacrifice that won't make you want to go out and take a poleax to every tree within a five-mile radius, try The Fire Cat."
1010,Petrik,A Game of Thrones ,"Jan 11, 2019",5,"A totally magnificent start to a seminal epic fantasy series. If you love watching the first season of Game of Thrones, you‚Äôre most likely going to love reading A Game of Thrones.

Like countless readers around the world, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have known about A Song of Ice and Fire without its TV series adaptation: Game of Thrones. I‚Äôve been following the TV series since the release of its first episode; I was utterly captivated by the originality of the storyline and characters. Upon finishing the first season of the TV show, I immediately picked up A Game of Thrones, and honestly? I couldn‚Äôt finish it; I put it down about a quarter into the book. It wasn‚Äôt because the book was bad per se; it was because the TV show‚Äîat least the first season‚Äîdid such a spectacular job of adapting the first installment of A Song of Ice and Fire. When my first entrance into a series is through a well-produced TV series/movies adaptation which I ended up loving, I often find the original material‚Äîusually novels‚Äîto be inferior because I already know how the main story will go down. It‚Äôs the biggest reason why I struggled to finish The Fellowship of the Ring, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs also the reason why I couldn‚Äôt finish A Game of Thrones back then. Fast forward to now, years have passed since my first attempt at reading A Game of Thrones. I‚Äôm finally able to finish it, and I also loved it so much; I craved for more by the end of it.



‚Äú... a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.‚Äù 



Was there even anything new with the book once you have watched the first season? Not so much. There‚Äôs Ned‚Äôs dream and the differences in character‚Äôs ages; the age of the characters‚Äîespecially The Starks and Daenerys‚Äîin the novel shocked me because they‚Äôre so much younger than they‚Äôre portrayed in the TV show. Then there‚Äôs also the fact that the book has more intricate world-building and history explained; story-wise, almost everything else was the same. On Goodreads, during the time of writing this review, A Game of Thrones has about 50,000 reviews and almost 2,000,000 ratings; I doubt anything I say about it will add anything substantial to what‚Äôs been said before. I have watched all the episodes in TV shows, and I pretty much know what the general plotline of the main series is all about. But I‚Äôll keep this review strictly narrowed to the reasons why‚Äîin my opinion‚ÄîA Game of Thrones and the first season of the TV show reached its phenomenal fame.

Picture: A Game of Thrones by Marc Simonetti



There‚Äôs immense strength in the unpredictability of Martin‚Äôs storytelling style. Martin is a storyteller that doesn‚Äôt follow the classic fantasy norm. A Song of Ice and Fire achieved something much greater instead; it has practically shaped modern fantasy. Sure, the series wouldn‚Äôt have reached its worldwide fame without the HBO adaptation of the series, but that doesn‚Äôt have any influence on the long-standing‚Äîand ever-growing‚Äîpraises for the books. Just observe the amount of inaccurate ‚Äúif you love Game of Thrones you will love this‚Äù or ‚ÄúGeorge R. R. Martin/Game of Thrones meets whoever/whatever‚Äù blurbs invading the current fantasy market; they‚Äôre uncountable.



 ‚ÄúBran thought about it. 'Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?'
'That is the only time a man can be brave,' his father told him.‚Äù 



Personally speaking, Martin brought a lot of something refreshing to the fantasy genre. Instead of writing a high fantasy comprised of magical battles and creatures, Martin did the opposite; magic and fantastical beings were relatively minimal, and unbelievably, he successfully nailed it. A Game of Thrones is not a story of good versus evil; it depicted a realistically grim story where the characters were morally flawed, grey, and the evilest beings in the world may not be The Others or dragons, but human after all. The good doesn‚Äôt always win, and the bad could brutally triumph. Martin explored this deeply and brilliantly within the bloody dispute and politics over the Iron Throne‚Äîthe seat of the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.



‚ÄúWhy is it always the innocents who suffer most, when you high lords play your game of thrones?‚Äù 



In the battle for the throne, no one is safe, not even the virtuous ones; the good and honorable ones frequently suffer more. The sense of unpredictability and danger sparked from Martin‚Äôs freedom and bravery to hurt and kill off the crucial main characters in the series‚Äîafter making his readers care for them‚Äîbrought an intensity that can only be found in very few of my favorite fantasy series. And get this, the majority of these authors claimed Martin as one of their main inspirations. 



‚ÄúWhen you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.‚Äù 



There‚Äôs this meme that has been spreading around the internet. This meme compared George R. R. Martin to Steven Erikson. Erikson himself has stated that he‚Äôs not competing with Martin with his fantasy, and I have no idea how this even became a meme in the first place. I‚Äôm talking about this picture:



I strongly disagree with this meme. Don‚Äôt get me wrong; Malazan Book of the Fallen is one of my top favorite series of all time. However, the main strength of the series‚Äîby far‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt lie in its character‚Äôs death. Honestly speaking, by book 5 or 6 of Malazan Book of the Fallen, the impact of the character‚Äôs death in the series has decreased significantly. Sometimes, I even eye-rolled when he killed off a character in the second half of the series; Erikson had an obsession with this particular plot device, and I was proven right over and over again. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a spoiler to say that Martin is a brutal author; he‚Äôs merciless towards his characters. But more importantly, ANY of the characters he decided to kill off frequently resulted in a massive and jaw-dropping impact that heavily affect the character‚Äôs decision and storyline progression.



 ‚ÄúWhat is honor compared to a woman's love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms . . . or the memory of a brother's smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.‚Äù 



If you‚Äôve watched the first season, is it still necessary to read the first installment of A Song of Ice and Fire? What exactly is the biggest reason to read A Game of Thrones after watching the first season of the TV show? I wouldn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs required to do it, but you‚Äôre most likely going to love the reading experience, and you‚Äôll also get more out of it as I did. I‚Äôve said it at the beginning of this review, I‚Äôm a very critical person when it comes to experiencing the original material of an adaptation I truly loved. However, I was simply too immersed in this read, and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of reading it. And it‚Äôs all due to Martin‚Äôs impeccable narrative, characterizations, and world-building.

Picture: The Night‚Äôs Watch Oath by Didier Graffet



Character‚Äôs internal thoughts and world-building are two factors‚Äîfrom my perspective‚Äîthat the TV show won‚Äôt be able to capture perfectly; they haven‚Äôt managed it to this day, and I doubt they will be able to with only one season left. Every character in the book was extremely well-developed. Although each new chapter always follows a different character‚Äôs POV than its previous one, all of them were superbly compelling and crucial to read. Reading A Game of Thrones brought a clearer and better understanding of the characterizations. That shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise; they‚Äôre two different mediums of storytelling, and this is one of the main advantages of reading a novel than watching a movie/TV series. The nuances in the character‚Äôs thoughts, personalities, and motivations made them more human and believable. All POV chapters in A Game of Thrones were written efficiently and effectively. Martin colored his characters with distinctive voices terrifically that every single dialogue and action felt like an addictive dance of inspiring and memorable words. 



 ‚ÄúNever forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.‚Äù 



The world-building was outstandingly intricate and immersive. A Song of Ice and Fire is a complex epic fantasy with multi-layered world-building; history upon history, accompanied with character‚Äôs connections that sprawled throughout the world. I mean it, if you‚Äôre not a fan of a massive fantasy world with detailed histories, politics, and many characters, you might want to prepare yourself before getting into this book. I do, however, believe that the complex and sprawling world that Martin created is somehow quite accessible to many fantasy readers. 



‚ÄúA lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot.‚Äù 



After you finished the novel, a realization will dawn that the main story and chaos have only just begun. A Game of Thrones is an absolutely stunning beginning to an incomplete legendary fantasy series. I‚Äôm seriously holding myself back here; the novel's strengths and why this book/series is so special and important for modern fantasy will need at least another thousand words to elaborate. But I doubt I need to; practically every fantasy reader these days knows about the existence of A Game of Thrones. The worldwide fame of this series speaks for itself already; quality stays. I recommend this novel with all my heart to every epic fantasy reader. The intricacies of the plot, characterizations, and world-building are worth your utmost attention; the maximum depth of them can only be achieved by reading the book, nowhere else. I feel like I‚Äôve gotten to know the characters and world further after reading A Game of Thrones, and I‚Äôm undeniably excited to continue reading A Song of Ice and Fire. Currently, A Song of Ice and Fire remain frozen in an incomplete‚Äîmost likely won‚Äôt ever be finished‚Äîstatus, but that doesn‚Äôt matter; reading this series is irresistible to me. Even if A Song of Ice and Fire doesn‚Äôt end up fully composed, I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôm happier to have read the series than not. That‚Äôs how incredible A Game of Thrones is.



‚ÄúThe things I do for love.‚Äù



Sidenote regarding the 20th Anniversary Illustrated Edition:
The 20th Anniversary Illustrated Edition is freaking gorgeous, and its production value is high; no doubt about that. However, I strongly recommend you to read this edition only if you have watched the first season of the TV series or you‚Äôre on your reread. If you‚Äôre a newcomer to the story, I suggest reading the prose-only edition instead. This edition is beautiful; each chapter begins with a black and white illustration done by highly praised artists in the industry. I mean it, each art could‚Äôve worked as a cover art due to its beauty and quality, even when most of the arts aren‚Äôt original to this edition. But this is also the main problem of this edition. Most of the art appeared at the start of a chapter, and they have a strong tendency of giving spoilers, or at least hints, of what‚Äôs to come in the particular chapter. Not to mention that a lot of the colored artworks are placed on the wrong page. An event happened in a chapter, but the colored artwork of that scene could appear in the next or previous chapter, which frankly just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Because of all these, I think it would be best if a complete newcomer to the series read the text-only edition.

1011,TK421,The Giving Tree,"May 26, 2011",2,"So it is Christmas time, and my wife likes to have all of us‚Äîmy wife and I, and our three years old twins‚Äîdo a different event each night during Advent as a family. I like this practice; it is little things like this that keep our family strong. Tonight‚Äôs event was reading Christmas themed books.

We decided to read THE GIVING TREE as well as three other Christmas books. Had I foreseen what was about to transpire I would have omitted THE GIVING TREE from my selection.

Allow me to replay said event:

The setting: Mommy and Daddy's bed.

After a torturous time of getting my kids to brush their teeth, put on their pajamas, and convinced that they should only bring two stuffed animals apiece to bed, I began to read the books. The first book went well. The kids laughed. My wife and I smiled. The second book was just as good as the first book. More laughter. More smiles. Then it was time for THE GIVING TREE. Now I‚Äôve read all of Shel Silverstein‚Äôs books. I find them quite enjoyable and zany and creative. 

THE GIVING TREE was no different. Or so I thought. You see, I never really paid much attention to the story. Well that‚Äôs not entirely true. I have always liked the message about giving when others are constantly taking. And Christmas time is a perfect time to share this message. 

But my son, Noah, interpreted the book differently. 

As I read the book I focused on how the little boy grows into a man and loses his innocence of giving, taking on a more selfish attitude. My son saw the boy growing older. When the tree gave everything but its stump to the boy as a man, I saw this as a generous message of charity. Noah saw it as the man killing the tree. But that‚Äôs not all.

An excerpt of the night:

Me: The End. That was a good story.

Noah: I didn‚Äôt like it.

Me: Why? The tree was very generous, and the man realized that he had only taken and never given back.

Noah: (Staring blankly at me as if I had just finished reading him my bank statement.)

Me: What didn‚Äôt you like about the story?

Noah: The boy grows old and kills the tree and is now going to die.

Me: (Inwardly: SSSSSHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!! The death subject.)

Me: No, honey. The tree gave its branches and trunk to the man‚Äî

Noah: The boy killed the tree. And now the boy is old and is going to die.
Me: No, buddy. The tree just changed. And the little boy lived a long life‚Äî

Noah: And now he is going to die.

Me: (FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!! Inwardly, of course.) 

So having no other way to combat my son‚Äôs determination to prove that the tree was murdered and that the little boy was now an old man and was going to die soon, I did what every father should do in this matter.

Me: Ask Mommy what she thinks, buddy."

1013,Mario the lone bookwolf,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Mar 07, 2018",5,"A work that showed humanity its insignificance and that madness is a general, entertaining trait in the universe. 
 
One of the greatest milestones of the rare Sci-Fi comedy hybrids, although it¬¥s losing quality after the first 3 parts. Fantasy seems to be more prone to comedy than Sci-Fi, I don¬¥t know why that¬¥s the fact. I would tend to call it kind of Terry Pratchett in space, because of the unique wit, just without the stamina for so many parts. Adams dying in a fitness center of a heart attack comes in here too, although he already stopped continuing the series years before.
 
More sheer fun than the rest of the serious
It¬¥s just hilarious and very clever, using different comedy tropes in space, not for science! One of these ideas one has once in a lifetime, in Adam's case mixed with talent. It¬¥s mostly constructed by 
 
Running gags, some sci-fi elements, and comedy characters.
Thereby, the wacky protagonists construct the laughs with slapstick, some deeper stuff, and general strangeness. The underlying criticism level isn¬¥t very high in the first part, which can mostly be seen as pure entertainment. 
 
So successful because it¬¥s so easy to read
There is better, more ironic, and more complex sci-fi out there, but nothing as pleasant as Adam's work. No need to think too hard or get depressed about human nature, no info dump and worldbuilding overkills, just characters, puns, and gags mixed with some dept and
 
The second and third part of the series include some of the best indirect social criticism too.
But it sadly doesn¬¥t improve after that, I¬¥ve read until the fifth one and Adams just can¬¥t live up to the expectations anymore, starts recycling his schemes, and just isn¬¥t as compelling as in the original trilogy. Maybe he had already enough money, wasn¬¥t really motivated, or lost his muse, but it¬¥s quite a shame because there would have been potential as endless as space for more, really good parts.
 
Useless fandom trivia
The author, as the story goes, had the idea while watching the sky completely wasted, some might say poisoned, by G√∂sser beer in my home country Austria. I don¬¥t believe this, because Stiegl beer is just much better than this bitter concoction. Whip me with a towel if you have a problem with that, I can easily handle a little intergalactic spanking.

1014,MacK,The Princess Bride,"May 12, 2008",5,"I'm a little biased when it comes to this book. Yes, I saw the movie first and it made me happier than anything I've ever seen before or since. Yes, I do consider how much a person likes The Princess Bride before determining how good a friend to be with them. (I don't insist on it, but it can queer a good friendship)

I'm not alone in this, but I do share a similar affinity for the book, despite discrepancies that may make others blanche. And even for me Fezzik will always be a Frenchman and not a Turk, and Goldman's ""Zoo of Death"" will be forever confused with ""The Pits of Despair"" but these are minor points.

The fact is that Goldman is a hell of a writer. The movie is great because it uses his screenplay wonderfully. The book is fantastic becasue he employs all his talents. He is a master of dialogue (what else would you expect from a man with two screenplay Oscars?), he details setting and character with a few quick flashes of his pen, and he has enough acerbic wit to have created what is, at once, both a brilliant satire of fairy tales and a compellingly readable fairy tale in its own right.

One of the surprising things is that Goldman sticks so doggedly to the conceit that there is an S. Mogenstern, a country called Florin, and that the novel is at once really ""abridged"" rather than written by him, and that everything actually does happen.

That becomes a trifle irritating, you almost want the man to admit that: ""yes, I am the man, I did write something that is beloved and adored and will be passed down from generation to generation, just as I claimed this book was passed down to me. Only, it is all me. My imagination, my genius, bow down and praise me!""

But he doesn't. And that, though irritating, is actually one of the best things about the book. Goldman himself suspends his disbelief and forces us to do the same. Imagination takes hold at the beginning and our immersion in it makes every page, every quip tantalizing to behold and easy to savor."
1015,jessica,The Help,"May 11, 2020",3,"ive had unpopular opinions about books in the past, but when its about a story that covers very sensitive and important topics, i feel especially guilty. 

i am not sure what it is exactly that rubbed me the wrong way, but i just couldnt fully support this book. the writing was fine and the characters are decent. but when a story discusses such heavy and often uncomfortable subjects, i want to feel strong emotions. but right now im only feeling mild concern.

and the question that keeps bothering me is, is this KSs story to tell? just because an author can write a story, does that mean they should? i think when it comes to telling a story that is inherently sensitive, much more consideration needs to be taken than usual. and i am starting to think KSs experience as a white woman may have unconsciously led her to stray from the story she was trying to achieve. this feels very full of racial stereotypes and i couldnt help but see skeeter as someone to be praised for her white-saviour complex. 

i believe the intentions behind this story are good ones. i appreciate that themes like societal pressures, bullying, and job dissatisfaction are relevant to today. i also appreciate that this story has helped readers empathise with the struggle against racial inequality. but for being a story about ‚Äòthe help,‚Äô this sure felt a lot like it was really about skeeter getting her dream job and all the drama in the white ladies debutante club. 

i dunno. maybe im reading too much into this and im trying to be too politically correct when i really should have just enjoyed a good story. regardless, im still a little disappointed by this.

1016,Lisa,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Jun 25, 2014",5,"""What is your favourite book, mum?""
 
How many times have my children asked me that, growing up with a mother who spends most of her time reading - to them, alone, for work, for pleasure - or looking for new books in bookstores wherever we happen to be.

""I can't answer that, there are so many books I love, and in different ways!""

""Just name one that comes to mind!""

And I said, without really knowing why, and without thinking:

""One Hundred Years Of Solitude!""

""Why?""

""Because...""

This novel taught me that chaos and order are two sides of the same medal - called family life. It taught me that sadness and love go hand in hand, and that life is easy and complicated at the same time. It taught me that many wishes actually come true, but never in the way we expect, and most often with a catch. It taught me that sun and rain follow each other, even though we might have to wait for four years, eleven months and two days for rain to stop falling sometimes. It taught me that there are as many recipes for love as there are lovers in the world, and that human beings are lazy and energetic, good and bad, young and old, ugly and beautiful, honest and dishonest, happy and sad, all at the same time, - together and lonely.

It taught me that we are forever longing for what we do not have, until we get what we long for. Then we start longing for what we lost when our dreams came true.

This novel opened up the world of absurdities to me, and dragged me in like no other. In each member of the Buend√≠a family, I recognise some relation, or myself, or both. Macondo is the world in miniature, and wherever I go, it follows me like a shadow. It is not rich, peaceful, or beautiful. It is just Macondo. No more, no less.

My favourite book? I don't know. There are so many. But I don't think any other could claim to be more loved than this one."
1017,James,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Aug 07, 2016",3,"From what I can tell, I'm not in the majority when it comes to rating The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. I'm giving it a 3, which means I still liked it... but unfortunately, I wasn't as fond of the humor as most people are.

This was a book club selection from about 6 or 7 years ago. We agreed to read just the first one in the series. And it was the first science-fiction novel we took on. I was excited. Several had already read it but wanted to again.

I'm generally a fan of crazy humor. I love Spaceballs, the movie. I kinda liken it to that, but for some reason, this wasn't as funny as I felt everyone said it was. Tons of laughs. Many great lines. The characters were memorable. I'm pretty sure there are a few movie or cartoon adaptions of it.

And I honestly would recommend that everyone read it -- even non SF fans. There are parts you will totally enjoy. But it's hard to get into for a non-SF reader right from the beginning. My first reactions were ""Oh that's not possible..."" But then I realized I wasn't reading a typical novel, so I suspended the lil' bit o' grouch in me... and I was able to enjoy it.



Very imaginative. Lots of cool commentary on life as other people would see it. A fair approach for someone new to the universe, so to speak.

I may go back and read it now that I'm older and have read a few other SF and fantasy books. I'm curious... what's the huge appeal for others about this book?

1018,Emily May,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Sep 30, 2013",1,"Clueless. I am clueless. The popularity of this book baffles me even more than the popularity of The Fault in Our Stars. Maybe I really am just a coldhearted person with no feelings.

Amazingly, I actually managed to start The Perks of Being a Wallflower knowing absolutely nothing about it. I've avoided all the reviews and hype over the years, I've purposely put off seeing the movie because I wanted to check out the book first. I knew nothing except that so many people LOVE this book. I was a bit sceptical from the very first page when 15-year-old Charlie's narrative opened with short, choppy, fragmented sentences:


I don't think that there is a favorite kid in our family. There are three of us and I am the youngest. My brother is the oldest. He is a very good football player and likes his car. My sister is very pretty and mean to boys and she is in the middle.

But I perked up at the idea of reading a book by a narrator with obvious learning difficulties. One of my favourite parts of reading is getting to see the world through the eyes of someone whose perspective I might not have fully considered before. So I was willing to overlook the slightly annoying use of immature language and structure because I realised it was needed to get inside the narrator's head. Imagine my surprise and confusion when I discovered that not only does Charlie not have any learning difficulties, but he is actually considered ""intelligent beyond his years"", is apparently extremely talented and somehow manages to get straight-A grades. What????? And also how?????

It's like I'm missing something. I must be, right? Because to me this seems like nothing more than the usual melodramatic issue book, desperately trying to manipulate my emotions with the subtlety of a million flying bricks. There's suicide, sexual abuse, and domestic abuse crammed into the first few chapters. Is that not enough angst for you? Well, wait a few more chapters and we get drugs, incest, fights and first sexual experiences, told through the eyes of a guy who sounds about eight but is actually a teenager.

I didn't feel sad or moved or anything so, like I said, maybe this is a character flaw on my part. But I'm tired of reading books where I can feel the author's little voice screaming between the lines ""Cry! Look people are dying and it is so sad, cry! Look incest and prejudice and rape, cry!"" 

I felt nothing. Except maybe manipulated; yeah, I definitely felt manipulated."

1020,James,The Help,"Jan 07, 2012",4,"I read this book at least 4 years ago, before I began to more consistently use Goodreads... and now I'm going back to ensure I have some level of a review for everything I read. It's only fair... if the author took the time to write it, and I found a few hours to read it... I should share my views so others can decide if it's a good book for them.

That said... did anyone not love or like this book? I'll have to check out some other people's reviews... And I wonder how many people just watched the movie... Oh well... I'll keep this review short and not in my usual format, as probably everyone I'm friends with on here has already read it! :)

The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because I felt like some of the stories needed a better or stronger ending. I truly think it is a fantastic book, and it makes you really think about what happened in the not-so-distant past... and probably still happening in some parts of the country today. Scary thoughts, but in the end, at least the right people got something back they deserved, even if it wasn't as much as it should have been.

The characters are very clear and strong. And when there are upwards of 10 to 12 supporting or lead female characters, an author has to spend a tremendous amount of time creating distinct pictures in a readers mind. Stockett did a great job with this task. Each and every one shows you a different personality: leaders and followers, movers and shakers, smart and silly, strong and weak, tolerant and intolerant, thirsty for all the world has to offer and content to stay the same for an entire lifetime.

When a writer can shuffle this many people throughout a story, they have invested themselves into the book, the characters, the setting, the theme, the future.

I haven't read anything else by this author, but just thinking about this book, and realizing I haven't looked at her other works makes me want to run to her profile now and pick one. Perhaps that's what I'll go do!

1021,lila ‚Äß ‚ÇäÀö‚òÖ,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Oct 25, 2023",4,"‚Äútell her she is the noor of my eyes and the sultan of my heart.‚Äù


this book is a love letter to all women.

of afghanistan. of the world. for the countless women who cannot raise their voices and speak up for what they believe in, simply because the world is such a shitty place. brutal because of its rawness, but also stunning because of how real it was. how poignant it was. how sad it made me. how it touched my heart. how much it incited me. how angry it made me. how powerful every moment was. this is one of those rare books that have enough passion to start a revolution. 

mariam and laila were just the most precious souls. no one deserves to suffer like they did and yet they had to go through it all with subdued gazes and meek glances. i definitely preferred laila‚Äôs point of view but mariam‚Äôs story was so real because of the way she felt unwanted by everyone, not experiencing an ounce of the type of love she‚Äôd always dreamed of having. but both of them were so soft and strong at the same time for standing up for themselves and yet knowing when to step down. i adore them so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π


‚Äúyou know.‚Äù
‚Äúknow what?‚Äù
‚Äúthat i only have eyes for you.‚Äù


laila and tariq were simply beautiful. i truly believe they are layla and majnun reincarnated ü•∫ they‚Äôve suffered so much i‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre finally having some semblance of happiness, even if it‚Äôs stolen moments. ü•π


like a compass needle that points north, a man‚Äôs accusing finger always finds a woman. always.


i hate rasheed and i know there are hundreds of men like him in the world, men who think they‚Äôre entitled to take whatever they want when they want, men who think women should be caged and imprisoned and made to do whatever the man of the house orders, men who think it‚Äôs alright to abuse and defile women and behave in absolutely vile and cruel ways. i love the way this book shows the truth of the world while not losing its track on the point it‚Äôs trying to make. 


each snowflake was a sigh heaved by an aggrieved woman somewhere in the world. all the sighs drifted up the sky, gathered into the clouds, then broke into tiny pieces that fell silently on the people below.


i feel this is one of those books everyone needs to read once in their lives, simply because of how much it makes you reflect on how things are in the world. because of how much it makes you feel. because mariam and laila‚Äôs story deserves to be heard. their story is the reflection of the suffering of hundreds of thousands of women in the past and present and it needs to be listened to. the impact it had on me was so profound and all i can say is‚Ä¶ just read it. the world is such an unfair, cruel, harsh, unfathomable place but this showed that light could shine from the most unlikely places and hope could peek out from the darkest depths of hell. and i loved it for showing me that. 


she is here, in these walls they‚Äôve repainted, in the trees they‚Äôve planted, in the blankets that keep the children warm, in these pillows and books and pencils. she is in the children‚Äôs laughter. but mostly, she is in laila‚Äôs own heart, where she shines with the bursting radiance of a thousand suns.


(i picked this up from my library two weeks back and while i‚Äôm a fast reader generally, i couldn‚Äôt bring myself to read more sometimes because of how horrified and disgusted and filled with rage this made me. it‚Äôs absolutely not one of the worst things i‚Äôve read, but then again, i generally read fiction and while this is that, it‚Äôs also something that happens in real life and the fact that these atrocities are so common in the world makes me so mad. you know that feeling when you know you wanna read more because you need to know what happens next, but you can‚Äôt bring yourself to pick the book back up because you‚Äôre scared? yup. that‚Äôs what happened. i shed so many tears while reading this.)"

It¬¥s more about the language than the plot
Bradbury has such a unique writing style, everything comes so smoothly and elaborately, full of metaphors and lively language. This, his most famous one, is a softer alternative to Orwell and Huxley, a more philosophical approach to the topic of censorship. Certainly one of the great works of the 20th century, if not of all time, reducing the story to some essential elements that 

Can be seen in Brave new world and 1984 too
A love story, an awakening antagonist, mass dumbing down by passive media consumption, substance abuse, propaganda, and a little grain of hope for a better tomorrow. It¬¥s closer to Brave new world than to 1984 because the mind penetration aspect of brainwashing is bigger than pure death squad brutality. It¬¥s also simply Bradburys style to avoid big action scenes and focus on character development, deeper meaning, and the language itself to create a picture of, well, freaking reality in very many places.
 
That¬¥s by far not his top performance
I understand why his other, as good and even better, works aren¬¥t as appreciated as this short one. Bradbury is at his best when he is writing short story collections under a main theme, be it The Martian chronicles
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7...
or The Illustrated Man
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...
One could go and start searching for all the interconnections between the stories and how perfectly they fit together, but the problem of having to begin again and again and getting out of reading flow is one of the main reasons why short stories aren¬¥t selling so great. Maybe it was popular those days, I don¬¥t know, but in the case of The Martian Chronicles, one of the first space opera novels could have been possible, the same with The Illustrated Man. It¬¥s sadly one of the worst cases of unused serial production potential.
 
He was such a great writer and I don¬¥t get why he didn¬¥t rewrite all the material he had with those short stories into one or more longer novels. It somehow feels to me as if he had a tendency to avoid longer novels, but just imagine how it would have been if he had written them or even a series instead of all of those unique short stories. Boy, he would have owned them all. I mean, Stephen King names him and Lovecraft as main inspirations and the more often I read something from one of these titans, the more I have to agree on how my beloved master of horror came to his writing style.

1023,Elle (ellexamines),City of Bones ,"Feb 28, 2016",1,"I was never expecting anything from this but an entertaining and maybe a little bit forgettable book. I was wrong; I found this completely unforgettable. For being a trainwreck.

To be quite honest, I think 75% of the hype for this series comes from nostalgia. Listen, I'm sorry, I know this isn't everything, but I really... don't get why these first three books are hyped, on any level. Not only do I have ten million problems with the tropey nature and the slutshaming and the etc etc etc, it's also just... boring and also, I hate every single character. I hated... almost everything about this, until book three, which I thought was okay because it didn't take me four months [you think I'm kidding?] and also for ending the incest plotline. [Yeah, that.]

Listen, I am not opposed to fun trash. I read The Infernal Devices this year and it was fantastic, and books two and three basically emotionally killed me inside. But this was not fun for me. 

Okay, so first of all, because we've all talked about this, The Mortal Instruments is kind of based off Cassandra Clare‚Äôs Harry Potter fanfiction [no, I'm not kidding], and it is painfully obvious. There are basic things, like that humans are known as ‚Äúmundanes,‚Äù while in Harry Potter they are known as ‚Äúmuggles.‚Äù But then there's also the fact that the characters kind of feel like not good fanfiction interpretations of various Harry Potter characters. Our redheaded lead character, Clary Fray, is a slightly stupider version of Ginny Weasley. Her love interest, Jace Wayland, is essentially Draco Malfoy if everyone excused his actions because he‚Äôs super hot. [I really don't like Jace.] Jace becomes a member of the Ripoff Death Eaters in like book two because his father is Ripoff Voldemort [his name is Valentine. which is actually hilarious]. Simon is... Harry [again, not a very good one], and Isabelle is Hermione, if Hermione were there exclusively to be slut-shamed by the angelic virgin protagonist. 

I mostly said this to point out how utterly fucking dull these characters are, but... listen, I'm not actually wrong about this. If you match the characters up to her fanfiction [which is not hard], the pairings fit. You know that thing I linked up above? Well, it discusses how the fanfiction trilogy [I mean, kudos for that dedication] is endgame Draco/Ginny and Harry/Hermione, with subtext between Harry/Draco [I'm so sorry, I'm laughing typing this]. The endgame of this series is Jace/Clary and Simon/Isabelle, with subtext between Jace/Simon. Do. you. think. I'm. kidding. 

But listen, you'd think that after ripping from fucking Harry Potter, Clare would‚Äôve at least come up with something interesting? I mean, fiction doesn't have to be original to be good. But again, it's basically boring, boring, boring, offensive, boring, jace is hot chapter, boring. 

I... don't even know where I'm going with this, I just need you all to know that this originated as Harry Potter fanfiction. Although I will point out that the original fanfiction this was based off of got taken off fanfiction.net after plagiarism accusations. And then there were Sherrilyn Kenyon's plagiarism accusations. I mean, I think fanfiction and original fiction used to be considered very different things in a way they almost aren't today, but... it's important to know.

Anyway. I've established at this point that the characters are flat, it's all painfully derivative, and the books themselves are... boring. But... there is so much more.

Beyond the issue of Clary's I'm-not-like-other-girls thing, there's also the issue of messily handled lgbtq stuff. So, yes, it's 2005, and I'm willing to excuse this... a little bit Alec Lightwood's entire presence in this book is to Create Some Angst through homophobia and it feels... so much like a plot device, not going to lie. While it's fair to mention that Cassandra Clare has improved her lgbtq rep - severalsapphic friends of mine would like to notify you that The Dark Artifices is awesome wrt this - it's not good in this series. Alec is barely a POV character in the first three books of the series, despite being marketed as a major character, and feels super tokenistic. Also, just... his treatment. At one point in this series, his mother, who is a supposedly likeable character, tries to kill him and his boyfriend for being gay, which he forgives her for [how?]. There is later on a lot of explicit biphobia towards Magnus [who is my favorite. I love Magnus] that is not subverted or criticized at all, and in this book especially, there's an intonation of that slutty bi trope [though the character is allowed to develop beyond that, man, it is there.]

‚ÄúYou're not gay, are you?""
Simon's greenish color deepened. ""If I were, I would dress better.‚Äù

this... is... not... funny...

No, Cassandra Clare would rather focus on something else: a sideplot where Ripoff Ginny Weasley believes Hot Draco Malfoy is her brother for two fucking books. It is exactly as terrible as it sounds. For two full books, I had to live through Ripoff Ginny Weasley‚Äôs angst over her crush on her brother and about their forbidden love or whatever the shit. Yes, I KNOW (view spoiler)[they eventually realize they weren't related. But here's the thing; they're still in love when they believe they are. (hide spoiler)] They almost have sex while still believing they're related [book three]. That's not even the weirdest part; they do it in Voldemort Except Boring‚Äôs home, right after they almost physically die, and it's wild. Do you know how many hours I spent trying to wash my eyes out after reading this? Why, exactly, is sex between two people who literally think they are siblings an enjoyable thing to read about? The focus on Draco Malfoy‚Äôs bare chest was bad enough; I don‚Äôt need to think about incest sex too. 

Oh, and there are so many constant descriptions of Jace‚Äôs utter maleness. It honestly feels like an entire book jacking off to the thought of Draco Malfoy‚Äôs bare chest. It's not good. 

I don't know. I guess not everything is bad? The worldbuilding was possibly something cool ten years ago, but it's pretty typical nowadays. I'll also give Clare a bit of credit - she's pretty great at writing dialogue. The moments where the characters are chatting or hanging out in squad dynamics are a lot of fun. 

But overall... no. It's full of tropes, there aren't really any plot twists, and it's honestly just boring. I'm sorry, I really don't understand the hype. Like, come on, besides being an example of all the worst bits of YA literature, from the underdeveloped characters to the lackluster worldbuilding, this first book truly takes the cake as one of the worst I've ever read. 

Oh, and I'm just going to say it: Jace and Simon have huge crushes on each other. I am NOT giving up this opinion. I don't really give a shit about either of them or care about this relationship, I'm just saying that factually, they talk about each other like they want to have wild sex. I'm ALSO saying that the ending scene of book two reads like shitty vampire smut. I'm picturing it on fanfiction.net with the description m/m blood drinking kink erotica don't like don't read!!!

VERDICT: This book is terrible. I'm somewhat shocked to say that it gets a little better later on, but this one is objectively terrible. Maybe just skip to book two if you genuinely want to read the series [listen, I like The Infernal Devices]. Or skim. Please just skim.

Okay, what did I just read? I wasn't expecting so many twists (especially in the last three chapters) and I feel so hysterical I wanna jump. As much as I am excited to share with y'all what I feel, I'm afraid I'll give away a few spoilers which I don't want to. 
I love Clary and Jace. I don't care about anything else, I just love them.

This was... well, not disappointing, but quite repetitive after reader Angels & Demons. I felt like I should've just read this first instead of trying to work my way through the series from first book in release order.


""I would not wish a British chef on anyone except the French tax collectors.""


It's not that the book was bad, but everything came out like it's the same story as the first using a different core element. While everything good about the first book, the pace, the suspense, the twists are stil here, I don't think there is a ton of novelty here other than some detailed and immersive code-breaking. Even the character setup was quite similar to Angels & Demons, with only a couple of minor changes. But as far as pure entertainment is concerned, Brown does deliver well. Not to mention the improved inclination towards humor, which was a welcoming change. What's not so welcoming is the author's continuous use of a second language for conversations.

1027,Kaylin (The Re-Read Queen),City of Bones ,"Oct 05, 2015",3,"3 Stars

Reviewing this is weird-- because I used to love it. When I was about 13, I remember finding this library book, taking it home and reading all 400+ pages  in one sitting. Then I went back the next day and grabbed the next two books, devoured them, thought that was the end and (mostly) forgot about it. (Until that awful movie came out a few years ago)

So reading it now, as an early-twentysomething with a lot more reading and life experience, I knew the initial love wouldn‚Äôt be there. I had a lot of problems with this. But I still couldn‚Äôt hate it. 

In fact, I can see why mini-me adored it. This is a really fun story. The world is exciting with a large cast of (mostly) interesting characters.  As Clary is inducted into the Shadowhunter World, we feel pulled along with her.  The world is mysterious and sexy and complex (looking at you: numerous spinoffs).

In that same vein, this introduces a slew of compelling side characters. (Aka, Alec, Magnus and Isabelle are my baes.) While the main character is frustrating (see next paragraph) the side characters are all really interesting! None are particularly well-developed here, but there are interesting dynamics at play-- the glamorous warlock who‚Äôs had enough of this Shadowhunter shit, the gorgeous huntress whose greatest priority is protecting her family, and the angsty, logical parabati scared to be who he is. Their stories are all really interesting, and I‚Äôm really excited to see their development again. 



But back to problem #1: the bland, frustrating, quasi-misogynist that is Clarissa Fray. I understand she serves as our introduction to the Shadowhunter world, so that‚Äôs where her story starts-- but there‚Äôs nothing else to her. Outside of asking questions about this world, she seems to have no personality, no aspirations, and nothing outside of basic ‚Äúoh-gee-golly-wow‚Äù reactions. Then, once the initial shock of ‚Äúdemon-hunters-oh-my‚Äù wears off, it seems like Miss Clare tried to give Clary some sort of sassy! and strong! personality-- AND FAILED HARD. Instead, Clary comes across as a patronizing bully.  She blames others for everything even though she very rarely knows what the hell is going on. She slaps her love interest twice for not agreeing with his actions-- and granted, I understand why they were fighting, but it comes across like the only way Clary can defend her position is physical violence. Which she has no personality, so maybe it‚Äôs true. 

(screw it, this rant gets more than one paragraph. #DEALWITHIT)

Clary has this god-awful self-loathing complex, I think. Because she‚Äôs utterly dripping with I‚Äôm-not-like-other-girls-so-lets-hate-all-other-girls which is some bullshit. My favorite example of this is when Isabelle dares to wear vanilla perfume of all things, and Clary has this whole internal rant about ‚Äúgirls who wear vanilla perfume‚Äù and how she just can‚Äôt fathom ‚Äúwhy they want to smell like cupcakes.‚Äù She then judges their ‚Äòdaintiness,‚Äô which is ridiculous because we all know Isabelle could kick every-square-inch of Clary‚Äôs ass. There‚Äôs more examples of this, including with female characters Clary doesn‚Äôt even know. It‚Äôs like she has absolutely no self-respect and the only way she feels good about herself is dragging down other women. Excuse me, it‚Äôs 2017 and I‚Äôm tired of this bullshit. 

(Also I wear vanilla perfume and I smell like a fucking delicious cupcake, thank you)

There‚Äôs also some plot points that just seem a little cheesy/underdeveloped to me, including: 
- how fast the romance goes from uneasy distrust to love
- the pointless love-triangle
- the way Jace is so easily swayed from one side to another
- the ex-machina of werewolves
- the way no one uses their steele‚Äôs half the time
- the way the steeles can do anything, except for when it‚Äôs actually useful.

(Also ‚Äòmundane/mundie‚Äô is wayyyy too similar to ‚Äòmuggle‚Äô for my taste. )

1028,Lyn,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Apr 18, 2015",5,"*** 2023 reread - 

In all of world literature there is a division: 1) One Hundred Years of Solitude and 2) all other books.

***

Mystical and captivating.

One Hundred Years of Solitude by Nobel laureate Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, first published in 1967 in his native Colombia and then first published in English in 1970, is a unique literary experience, overwhelming in its virtuosity and magnificent in scope.

I recall my review of Tolstoy‚Äôs War and Peace, trying to describe a book like it and realizing there are no other books like it; it is practically a genre unto itself. That said, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a masterpiece of narrative ability, and is itself unique as a statement, but reminiscent of many other great books: Pasternak‚Äôs Doctor Zhivago, Lowry‚Äôs Under the Volcano, Buck‚Äôs The Good Earth, and Joyce‚Äôs Ulysses were the works that I thought of while reading, but no doubt this is a one of a kind.

Using all of the literary devices I have ever learned and making up many more as he went along, Garc√≠a M√°rquez established a new epoch of descriptive resonance. Magic realism and hyperbole abound in his fantastic history of the mythical town of Macondo separated by mountains and a swamp road from everything else and of the Buend√≠a family, whose lifeblood was the dramatic heart of the village from inception until the fateful end.

Garc√≠a M√°rquez employs incestuous and repetitive family situations to emphasize his chronicle and a dynamic characterization that is labyrinthine in its complexity. Dark humor walks the ancient halls of the ancestral mansion home along with the ghosts of those who have come before. Incredibly Garc√≠a M√°rquez ties it all together into a complete and prophetically sound ending that breathes like poetry to the finish.

Finally I must concede that this review is wholly inadequate. This is a book that must be read.

**** 2018 - I had a conversation about this book recently and I was asked ""what was the big deal?why was this so special?"" It had been a while since I had read but my response was that after turning the last page I was struck dumb, had to walk the earth metaphorically for a few days to gather my thoughts on what I had read - really more than that, what I had experienced. I read alot of books and a book that smacks me like that deserves some reflection.

Another indicator to me, and this is also subjective - is that I have thought about this book frequently since. I read a book and enjoy it, was entertained and escaped for a while into the writer's world, and then I finish and write a review, slap a 3 star on it and go to the next book. There are some books, years later that I have to refresh my memory: who wrote that? what was it about? Not so with 100 years. Like so many other five star ratings, this one has stayed with me and I think about Macondo sometimes and can see the weeds and vines growing up through the hardwood floors. 

This is a special book."
1029,Nilufer Ozmekik,Anne of Green Gables ,"Aug 15, 2020",5,"Are you also die-hard fan of Netflix series: Anne with an E! And also have you been pouting since the day you have heard the cancellation news? If your answer is no, that‚Äôs fine, you just miss another epic visual feast, shame! Especially the teen romance Anne and Gilbert is guaranteed to make you smile and warm your heart. 

But before that, if you want to revisit the joy, innocence, naiveness, beauty of your childhood, just grab this book and meet with orphan Anne Shirley whose positive, optimistic, exciting energy is contagious. And you may prefer audiobook version to listen the powerful narration of Rachel McAdams. 

For decades this book has been considered as children novel but it also teaches us so many things about life, parenthood, friendship, questioning town‚Äôs people‚Äôs biased, hypocrite thoughts and wrongful beliefs through the eyes of a little girl who has been accidentally adopted by Cuthberts: Marilla and Matthew: brother and sister who needed a boy to help them at farm‚Äôs chores. But as you may imagine Anne found a way of enchanting them with her pure joy and excitement. Yes, she stayed with them to be their mischievous, unique, cheery, smart daughter. 

Here are my favorite quotes of the novel:

‚ÄúPeople laugh at me because I use big words. But if you have big ideas, you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I‚Äôll tell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone or in the deep, deep woods and I'd look up into the sky‚Äîup‚Äîup‚Äîup‚Äîinto that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. And then I'd just feel a prayer.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet.‚Äù 

‚ÄúKindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It's splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.‚Äù

This time I‚Äôm thanking Goodreads to put this book in ‚ÄúMost Popular 100 YA books list‚Äù and reminded me of how much I enjoyed it when I was a kid so helped me revisit my memories. As an adult, I still wholeheartedly adore this book! It truly made my whole weekend."
1030,John Mauro,The Giving Tree,"Jul 09, 2021",5,"Is this a children's story or the most effective flash fiction for adults ever written? The story is that of a one-sided relationship.

I throughly enjoyed listening to it, ignoring the book. However, I would feel unfair if I didn't point out the differences from the book as given at Tolkein Gateway
The script by Brian Sibley and Michael Bakewell attempts to be as faithful as possible to the original novels, but there are some errors and alterations. They include: 
‚Ä¢ At one point, Minas Anor and Minas Tirith are referred to as though they were separate cities; these are merely alternate names for the same city. 
‚Ä¢ Part of the Battle of Pelennor Fields sequence is described in song by an opera-style vocalist rather than acted, which may distance some listeners from the action. Others may find the kinship between the sequence and Eddic style of storytelling interesting. 
‚Ä¢ The journey through Dr√∫adan Forest and the subsequent alliance with Gh√¢n-buri-Gh√¢n's wild men, or ""woses"" is removed from the radio drama. 
‚Ä¢ Quickbeam the Ent does not appear in the story. 
‚Ä¢ Gildor Inglorion does not appear in the story. 
‚Ä¢ The radio serial omits the sequence in the book in which the hobbits visit with Tom Bombadil. However, in doing so, the Hobbits are never shown to receive their swords from the Barrow-downs and so it remained a mystery how the Witch-king was able to be so wounded"
1032,Mansoor,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Apr 20, 2007",3,"The Magician's Nephew is easily the best story of the Chronicles. First of all, it's the least overtly religious. There is a creation-of-the-world element, but it's not our world so it seems more fantastic than religious. Not only is there a veil over the religiosity, there's so much creativity in this story: the magical rings, the in-between place, the Deplorable Word, the founding of Narnia.

Starting with The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, the religiosity becomes noticeable, with the Witch as Satan, Aslan as Jesus, and the Emperor as God. And because of the talking, fighting animals, the fantasy seems aimed at children. I might have enjoyed it more at age 12.

The next story in the series, The Horse and His Boy, takes a dark, ethnocentric turn with its unfavorable depiction of the Arab-like ""Calormen"" (shoes turned up at the toe, scimitars, suffixed phrases of praise, ""son of"" lineage declarations). In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, we get a not-quite-positive summary of the Calormen:

""...they are a wise, wealthy, courteous, cruel and ancient people. They bowed most politely to Caspian and paid him long compliments...but of course what they wanted was the money they had paid.""

Given that this book was published in 1954, it's possible to forgive the cultural insensitivity, but it's sad that children around the world still uncritically read such racist material.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader demonstrates the problem with using God (or Jesus) in a story: there are no real conflicts. When the Dawn Treader stops at Dragon Island, the boy passenger Eustace wanders off, encounters a magical spell, and is turned into a dragon. This raises all kinds of serious issues about how to keep Eustace the Dragon with them, but none of these problems matter because, within 24 hours, Aslan just changes Eustace back to a boy.

There was a similar deus ex machina (the term being used most appropriately) in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. To save Edmund's soul, Aslan sacrifices his life. But it wasn't Aslan's only life, he had another one ready.

One thing I found especially creative about The Chronicles is how a story involving talking animals justifies eating animals."
1033,Madelene,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Sep 16, 2012",4,"It might be a classic, but there are many who have stern reservations about reading this series, partially I suspect due to its length... Well my answer to this is simply: DON'T BE LAZY!

My journey within Middle Earth stated as young teenager - my parents gave me 'The Hobbit' as a Christmas present one year and my father and I decided we'd enjoy it together. I think it was the last book he ever read me as a 'bedtime story', but we embarked on the adventures of Bilbo Baggins together and absolutely loved every minute of it! The Hobbit was a stunning example of fantasy and adventure writing at its best. One event after another, crisis after epic excitement, wonder at the enormity of the main character's daring and courage.

I am only sorry it took me so long to pursue the ongoing tale of the hobbits at Bagend. The Lord of the Rings was definitely a further step up the scale though. I will not deny that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a difficult read in terms of perseverance (hence 4 stars). I have always been an avid reader and there were a couple of times as I went through my teens that I picked up the Fellowship of the Ring and gave up before I could really get my teeth into it. Indeed, I didn't finish the trilogy until I was in my early 20s and I'm not ashamed to admit that I was actually quite proud of myself for having finally completed this mammoth journey with Frodo and his companions. I read about 2/3rds of the trilogy in one block in the end as I decided to forbid myself to watch the epic films again until I was done with the books because I knew that every time I grew impatient for the story to continue without wanting to spend the time or the energy reading it, I'd watch the films and that would result in me not feeling the need to continue the book for a good while. I say all this to illustrate a point - don't give up! It's totally worth it!

The Lord of the Rings is filled with new troubles and adventures. At first the idea of following several characters quite separately may be quite unusual, even a little daunting. But it truly brings the world of Middle Earth to life! You get a true feel for the scale and even the politics of such a creation by journeying through it with different companions, each with a different purpose. The struggles and hardships are of such importance and value to both the reader and the characters by the end of the journey, Tolkien has spoken volumes about friendship, love, bravery, honour, loyalty, deceit...you name it, its all there.

These books are a must read, wherever you are in your lifetime."

...you owe it to yourself and your family to find out. 

With the plethora of wonderful reviews already written for this book by my fellow GRs, I decided instead to provide some helpful, practical advice on why reading this book might benefit my fellow goodreaders. Therefore, as both life management tool and a safety warning, I have compiled my: 

Top 5 Reasons Why You Should Read Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy:
.
.

Number 5
: It‚Äôs a pleasant diversion to keep your mind occupied and pass the time while you are getting electrolysis to remove those areas patches blankets of unwanted hair: 


 
‚Ä¶Yikes, somebody please get that man a Klondike Bar.


Number 4
: The book is smart, funny, well-written and full of wonderful commentary on the human condition and clever humor: 
 ‚Ä¶The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.

	‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòYou know,‚Äô said Arthur, ‚Äòit's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.‚Äô		
‚ÄòWhy, what did she tell you?‚Äô		
‚ÄòI don't know, I didn't listen.‚Äô

‚Ä¶ Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God. The argument goes something like this: `I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, ‚Äòfor proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.‚Äô ‚ÄòBut,‚Äô says Man, ‚ÄòThe Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.‚Äô ‚ÄòOh dear,‚Äô says God, ‚ÄòI hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic.

	 ‚Ä¶For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons

	‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòAh,‚Äô said Arthur, ‚Äòthis is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn't previously aware of.‚Äô
Number 3: This gentleman DOES NOT appear in the book:





Seriously, isn‚Äôt the absence of thong-boy reason enough to give this book a chance?

Number 2: North Korea's Kim Jong- il hates this book



...and the enemy of my enemy is my friend. 

And finally‚Ä¶.

Number 1: Understanding the deep, nuanced meaning at the heart of this novel will help better prepare you should you ever find yourself in a situation like this:


 

Don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs too late‚Ä¶for yourself and your loved ones, read The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy today. 

If through sharing the above bit of meaningless nonsense wisdom, I have: (i) introduced someone to a worthwhile read, or (ii)provided a means of dealing with the agonizing pain of having chunks of fur ripped from their body, or (iii) shown people a picture of a man in a thong changing a tire, or (iv) pissed off a despotic assclown, or (v) simply provided a safety tip regarding avoiding unsolicited sexual advances in the guise of impromptu gift-giving, than I feel I have accomplished something. 

I only did this because I had a collection of funny pics and couldn‚Äôt figure out what else to do with them so I bootstrapped them in to a review I care.

3.5 stars."
1035,Kai Spellmeier,A Game of Thrones ,"Apr 03, 2015",5,"‚ÄúWhen the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives.‚Äù

This took me quite a while. First, because I already knew what happened from the show, second because I guess you just cannot rush through this book that fast, and third because I dreaded all the horrible things and painful deaths that were going to happen.
Sometimes I wish I could forget everything I knew about a book/show and just start anew. Maybe I would have read this novel faster if I hadn't known everything already? Because A Game of Thrones is very close to the first season of the show, only with more detail.
So GRRM is a great storyteller, but also a cruel one. You just never know what is going to happen next and you really fear for all the characters you love. This whole series is just so big. And awesome. And I really don't know where this is all going to go and how it will end but well...Hoping for many dead Lannisters.

1037,Tatiana,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Dec 01, 2011",2,"There may be a book in the world that can address, just within very few pages, suicide, molestation, domestic abuse, homosexuality, drug use, mental issues, first sexual experiences, rape, abortion, etc., and not sound like a Lifetime movie, but The Perks of Being a Wallflower is not an example of that. 

For me, the straw that broke the camel's back was when I realized that, to add to all of the above mentioned melodrama, the narrator was either emotionally or mentally handicapped. It appeared, Charlie's inability to identify any emotion within himself besides sadness, his constant crying, his lack of knowledge (at the age of 15) what masturbation was, his failure to understand any social situation (like a rape while witnessing it in his teen years) was indicative of either some form of autism or just severe mental immaturity. This, I thought then, was too exploitative. At that point, only a victim of cancer (or AIDS) was missing from this already uber-dire, emotionally manipulative narrative.

But, as it turned out, I was very wrong. Charlie was, evidently, just a shy, socially awkward, AP-classes attending, extremely gifted and observant student with a dark secret. At least, that how he was described by other people. What?! What does it say about Stephen Chbosky's writing abilities if his supposedly intelligent teen narrator sounds like a 7-year old? If Charlie's writing was reflective of his speech and interactions, how in the world could he become friends with a crowd of cool older kids and even had girlfriends, all of whom thought him petty much the best thing since sliced bread? 

I can attribute the popularity of this novel only to the story's great variety of tear-jerking opportunities, teachable moments and life lessons, gently delivered by the ever-so-wise and deep narrator. This isn't even controversial enough to deserve all those bannings. 

2 stars for moments of interest of the train-wreck kind."

OKAY? 
OKAY



There are almost 33000 reviews of this book. Why do I try to write one? I just don‚Äôt know but I do know that I have to let you know my thoughts about this AWESOME book.

I love YA. Even if I take YA holidays sometimes and stop reading it I can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs one of my fave genres. This book and Forbidden are probably my favourite YA books and right now I cannot decide which one is my absolute favourite. 

I knew about this book, I knew how it ended and I thought I couldn‚Äôt read it because the story was kind of personal for me but I will talk about that after my review.

This is the story of Hazel Grace & Augustus Water. Hazel has cancer and she meets Augustus at Support Group. They are ADORABLE. Hazel is the teen I always wanted to be: intelligent, funny, a great daughter and a very strong kid.


There is only one thing in this world shittier than biting it from cancer when you‚Äôre sixteen, and that‚Äôs having a kid who bites it from cancer


And Augustus‚Ä¶ well, he‚Äôs just then teen boyfriend I always wanted to meet: charismatic, positive, funny, happy and a GREAT best friend.


‚ÄùI enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence‚Äù




Hazel Grace is just like us, she loves books and she specially loves her favourite book ‚ÄúAn Imperial Affliction‚Äù by Peter Van Houten who happens to be her best friend, but let‚Äôs say this is a one-sided friendship. I also want a lot of authors to be my friends!

She tells Augustus about the book and he obviously reads it because he would do ANYTHING for Hazel Grace.


‚ÄùLove is keeping the promise anyway‚Äù


Enter Isaac, Augustus‚Äô best friend. He‚Äôs the best friend I always wanted to have. A romantic, a fool romantic who has cancer in his eyes‚Ä¶

This book is about love, friendship, fight, hope and life. And about  infinites 



As I mentioned, Hazel is obsessed with Peter Van Houten. Apparently he never finished his book An Imperial Affliction so she decides to mail him asking for answers. Because as she said, authors shouldn‚Äôt end their books if they‚Äôre not finished, right? I am gonna do the same with some authors‚Ä¶


And of course, if you ever do decide to write anything else, even if you don‚Äôt want to publish it, I‚Äôd love to read it. Frankly, I‚Äôd read your grocery list.


I might have mentioned that to one of my favourite M/M authors. I am pathetic! 

The days go by and Hazel and Augustus cannot stay away from each other and their relationship is soooooo freaking sweet. OMG, I am in love with Augustus Waters, he‚Äôs probably the BEST book boyfriend EVER.


‚ÄùOh my God, stop flirting with me!. We both know that okay is a very flirty word. Okay is BURSTING with sensuality‚Äù.




I just loved how the author made me laugh so much. I mean, I was reading a book about kids with cancer, I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be laughing but I did. I did because those damn characters camped in my heart and they are planning to stay there forever.
 

‚ÄùIt would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you‚Äù.


And you feel you‚Äôre discovering love for the first time with them all over again. Like true love, that kind of love that comes from a friendship. A love that is not based on how hot you are but how interesting you are. A love that is based in understanding each other, in accepting that we are grenades that can explode, in being there for each other no matter what.



This is probably one of the best and most real love stories I‚Äôve ever read in my entire life. I will never EVER forget this book, I actually ordered the paperback as I need to smell the book, I need to hug Hazel and tell her she‚Äôs my new best friend even if this is also a one-sided friendship. I need to tell Isaac that his special person is going to come to his life one day and he‚Äôs gonna know what real love is.

I need to hug Hazel‚Äôs father and tell him I freaking LOVE him because he reminded me of my father. A lot of families should take Hazel‚Äôs family as an example. You need to give love if you want to receive love and that‚Äôs what this family did.


‚ÄùThe world is not a wish-granting factory‚Äù.


And even if the world is not a wish granting factory you cannot stop believing that good things will come because they will. You just need to be positive and enjoy what you have, enjoy every single second with the people you love just like Hazel & Augustus did.




‚ÄùYou don‚Äôt get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.‚Äù.




***The below is not about the book, is about my life, you might not want to read it but I have to say this***



That man on the picture was my best friend for almost 19 years, the man of my life, my half, the person who will be my example until the last day of my life. The person who taught me that reading was one of the best experiences in life. The BEST father ever!. His lungs didn‚Äôt keep their shit together, as Hazel would say and he left us three months after being diagnosed with cancer (almost 12 years ago).

While we were with chemo, and I say we because I used to go with him every Monday, I met a kid who was way too young to have cancer. I couldn‚Äôt understand why kids had cancer, it wasn‚Äôt fair. 

Once my father was gone I wanted to get something positive about that horrible experience so I started volunteering with an association that helped kids with cancer: AVOI.



The guy who started this association had a kid with cancer who died and he decided to create this association to help families in that situation. He is an example for me. It wasn‚Äôt my moment anyway because everything was very fresh and I couldn‚Äôt help but think about my father every time I was with those kids and it‚Äôs hard when you go back week after week and there are some kids that are not there anymore‚Ä¶

This book reminded me of that association. Life sucks sometimes but while you can, get the best of it. Tell your friends and family you love them, don‚Äôt assume they know you love them. Enjoy every single second with them because one day, death will take them or will take us.

I will give years of my life for one more evening with my dad, to hear his voice one more time so PLEASE show your love and enjoy your family and friends while you can.

I don‚Äôt want you guys to feel sad about my story because I was lucky, I got to have the BEST father ever and that‚Äôs something that makes me happy‚Ä¶"
1039,T.J.,Memoirs of a Geisha,"May 13, 2008",3,"Damn if you aren't one of the most problematic things I've ever read, Memoirs of a Geisha.

Like much of non-Asian America, I was swept up in the delight of reading this book in 2000. I was fifteen and precocious, and the narrative was arresting. I couldn't put the book down. I wrote this in 2000:

""Golden has hit pay dirt with this masterpiece. An insightful, curious, and caring look into the mysterious world of geisha, Arthur Golden peels away the ignorance and labeling that westerners have covered the secretive Japanese profession. Although it sinks at times into a near melodramatic prose, the book's protagonist is interesting, insightful, and enjoyable. Her witty anecdotes and thoughtful mannerisms in speaking make Memoirs of a Geisha a delightful and unstoppable read.""

Then I got older, went to college and graduate school, and developed a critical, thinking eye.

And I'm mad at myself.

insightful? Really? God, I was naive. This novel, while entertaining is so problematic I rarely have time to descend into my criticism. It continues the Orientalism that Edward Said loathed so very much; rather than ""skillfully entering"" the world of a Japanese woman, it apes her identity, and ultimately deprives her of a voice, creating a sort of Orientalist imagination for us to enjoy without ever really seeing her. The book is still engaging as a narrative, but the sappy ending, the frankly sexist portrayals at some points, and Sayuri's outright inability to identify outside of her Chairman is rather frightening. It serves to objectify fetishism at its worst. Yet I can only give you three stars, because I'm still partly under your spell, Golden. Damn."

1041,Erin,The Little Prince,"Apr 29, 2008",5,"We are all children in adult bodies. Yes we are, don't think we aren't for one moment. The fact that we WERE, indeed, children, is a huge part of each of us. It is possible to shed a few appreciative tears on every page of this book if you entertain the thought that the pilot IS The Little Prince. Maybe you won't think that--maybe you'll have your own take on the book---that's the magic about it. This book is translated to English from French. If you understand and/or appreciate French, the deliciousness of that fact can affect you in addition to the sweet storyline itself. The book won't even take you a whole day to read. Consider honoring the Little You that still remains, and resides within you, and read this salute to childhood, to innocence, and to you. It just takes a 'Little' imagination and bravery."
1042,Sithara,The Alchemist,"Dec 22, 2007",2,"I need to start this review by stating 1) I can't stand self-help books and 2) I'm a feminist (no, I don't hate men- some men are quite awesome, but I am very conscious of women and our place in the world.)

Short summary (mild spoilers): A boy named Santiago follows his 'Personal Legend' in traveling from Spain to the Pyramids in Egypt searching for treasure. Along the way, he learns 'the Language of the World' the 'Soul of the World' and discovers that the 'Soul of God' is 'his own soul.'

If the statements in quotes above ('personal legend', etc) fascinate you, then you'll enjoy this book. If you think they are hokey and silly, then you'll think this is a terrible book. If you think statements such as ""When you want something, all the universe conspires you to achieve it"" and ""All things are one"" are moving and life-changing, you'll love this book. If such statements have you rolling your eyes, then this isn't your cup of tea.

Its not that I find anything wrong with these messages. They are important, but must be balanced with responsibility. In my experience, 'following your dreams' (or personal legend) is not the only way toward wisdom and strength. Is the person who struggles to put food on the table every day for his or her family, consciously realizing that he or she may not be following his or her 'personal legend' any less heroic than some traveler who leaves everything and everyone he or she is responsible for to go on a spiritual quest? Coelho comes close to labeling such people, as losers in life, which I find completely off the mark as some of these people have the most to offer in terms of wisdom.

The issue of responsibility is also part of this book's sexism. The main male characters in the novel have 'Personal Legends' - they are either seeking them, or have achieved them, or have failed to achieve them. But Coelho never mentions 'Personal Legend' with regard to women, other than to say that Fatima, Santiago's fiance, is 'a part of Santiago's Personal Legend."" Thats fine, but what about her own Personal Legend? Instead of traveling to find her dreams, she is content to sit around, do chores, and stare everyday at the desert to wait for his return. This is her 'fate' as a desert women. The fact that women don't have Personal Legends is even more galling considering the fact that according to Coelho, even minerals such as lead and copper have Personal Legends, allowing them to 'evolve' to something better (ie, gold).

In the ideal world presented in THE ALCHEMIST, it seems that the job of men is to seek out their personal legends, leaving aside thoughts of family and responsibility, and its the job of women to let them, and pine for their return. Of course, someone has to do the unheroic, inconvenient work of taking care of the children, the animals, the elderly, the ill...If everyone simply goes off on spiritual quests, deciding they have no responsibility other than to seek their Personal Legends, no one would be taking responsibility for the unglamorous work that simply has to take place for the world to run.

On the other hand, what if both men and women are allowed to struggle towards their 'Personal Legends,' and help each other as best as they can towards them, but recognize that their responsibilities may force them to defer, compromise, or even 'sacrifice' their dreams? This may seem depressing, but it isn't necessarily. Coelho seems to think that Personal Legends are fixed at childhood (or at birth, or even before) and are not changeable: they have to be followed through to the end, no matter how silly. But in my experience, many people have chosen to adjust, compromise, and even 'give up' on their dreams, only to find that life grants them something better, or they have a new, better dream to follow, a path providing greater wisdom. For me, these people have a more realistic, more humble, more fair, and less cliched vision of the world than Paulo Coelho's vision in THE ALCHEMIST."

1044,Lisa of Troy,The Fault in Our Stars,"Oct 12, 2022",3,"My emotions and thoughts with this one are all over the place so let‚Äôs see what we can do‚Ä¶.

The Fault in Our Stars is about Hazel Grace, a 16-year-old girl who has had some close brushes with death. She has thyroid cancer which has spread to her lungs. For now, the cancer is at bay with an experimental treatment. One day, she meets Augustus Waters in a support group, and the two strike up a friendship. 

Along the way, Augustus and Hazel will try to find some answers from their favorite author. How will these two sort through their feelings for each other and to life‚Äôs deeper questions?

Personally, I really enjoyed the first half of the book, especially the witty banter between Hazel and Augustus.

However, the second half of the book is where things started to unravel.

This last year, I have had some very close brushes with death myself. In fact, I have died twice in the last year. My heart stopped. 

At one point in the book, Hazel is lamenting, ‚Äú‚Ä¶.there is no glory in illness. There is no meaning to it. That is no honor in dying of.‚Äù

This really, really bothered me, because, in my experience, this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. 

I am alive today because of an incredibly brave young woman named Amy Lee Fisher.

Amy Lee Fisher was a YouTube creator who suffered from various illnesses. She was the only other person that I knew who had all of the same illnesses that I had. In her last YouTube video, she talked about having a blood clot which went to her lungs. 

She died shortly thereafter.

Six months later, I was at The Mayo Clinic. My heart was in such bad shape that I could not even ride a stationary bike for 60 seconds. The doctors tried to send me home to start to some heart rhythm medications. Because of Amy‚Äôs recent passing flashing through my mind, I said that I would rather not.

I was admitted to the hospital. After reiterating Amy's experience with blood clots, the doctors stabbed me in the stomach every couple of hours with blood thinners. The next day, my heart medication failed. A couple of days later, I had heart surgery.

Without Amy, I would have gone home and died. 

When I was wheeled into my heart surgery, was I worried? No. Sometimes when you are sick, you die, and there is nothing that you can do about it. However, if I was going to die, I wanted my death to mean something. I wanted to help other people. I wanted the doctors to know that the next time around to go right instead of left. 

Amy Lee Fisher shared her story, and it saved my life. There is great honor in that.

1045,Melissa ~ Bantering Books,Fahrenheit 451,"Mar 02, 2023",4,"From 1953 to 2023 ‚Äì oh, how times haven‚Äôt changed.

Seriously, did Ray Bradbury peer into a crystal ball while writing his dystopian classic, Fahrenheit 451? It sure seems like he did.

Because the world Bradbury foresaw back in 1953 is so eerily reminiscent of our world today. The book burning, the technology overload, the brainwashing and oppression of independent thought ‚Äì it‚Äôs all very familiar.

There is much to unpack. I could spend days dissecting the themes, symbolism, and how the novel is a mirror image of today‚Äôs society, 70 years after it was written. But I won‚Äôt do it here, as no one really wants to read a lengthy dissertation on Goodreads. I‚Äôll instead leave my thoughts swirling in my head and voice them to my husband. He will listen, nod, and smile.

I am so grateful to my dear friend, Terrie Robinson, for nudging me in the direction of the audiobook of Fahrenheit 451. Performed by the talented actor, Tim Robbins, his incredible narration creates a memorable listening experience.

Now off I go to unplug the TV and power down my devices. It's time to read a book."
1046,Amanda,Nineteen Eighty-Four,"Jun 06, 2008",5,"I've put off writing a review for 1984 because it's simply too daunting to do so. I liked 1984 even better after a second reading (bumping it up from a 4 star to a 5 star) because I think that, given the complexity of the future created by Orwell, multiple readings may be needed to take it all in. I thought it was genius the first time and appreciated that genius even more the second time. 

Orwell had a daunting task: creating a future nearly half a century away from the time period in which he was writing. This future had to be its own complex, independent society, but it also had to be the natural end result of the totalitarianism Orwell witnessed in the communist and socialist regimes of World War II. That's part of the horror of 1984: this future is a recognizable one, even in the 21st century. It's easy to see how those in control can, through manipulation and propaganda, maintain that control simply for the sake of sating their own power hunger. It's easy to say ""no one could ever tell me what to think or what to do,"" but the Party's use of Big Brother, the Thought Police, the Two-Minute Hate, and Doublethink make it easy to see how a person's ability to think independently and discern fiction from reality can be eroded when there is no touchstone to fact. Revising and rewriting the past to make certain that Big Brother and the Party are always correct has effectively eliminated historical accuracy. How can one think and reason in a society where everything is a fabrication?

Another facet of 1984 that I find fascinating is the relationship between Winston and Julia. Winston claims Julia is a ""rebel from the waist down,"" engaging in promiscuity and hedonistic indulgences forbidden by the Party. She doesn't care about social injustice or defining ""reality""; she only longs for what will make her feel good in the moment and only rebels far enough to get what she wants. By comparison, Winston is an intellectual rebel, constantly worrying over the issues of truth and freedom and the real, unvarnished past, but limited in how far he's willing to push the boundaries (until he meets Julia). Together, they make a complete rebellion--physical and mental, but apart they find themselves impotent to stand up to the Party. 

A cautionary tale, social commentary, and exemplary example of dystopian fiction, 1984 is one of those perfect novels that not only entertains, but forces one to think about the danger associated with giving any one person or entity too much power or control over our lives--issues well worth consideration in post-9/11 America.

Click the link for my video review of the big bois in my life.The Written Review:
 

I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.
Liesel, an orphaned girl, is sent to live with a foster family right before the Nazi's take over Germany. 

She has a peculiar attachment to books, her first being a gravedigger's manual that she picks up during her brother's funeral. 

Death takes an interest in her and her books on that day and follows her, sometimes constantly and sometimes at a distance. 

There's just something so...fascinating...about her that Death cannot stay away.

Meanwhile Liesel slowly grows up in the heart of Nazi Germany. 

Her adoptive Papa and Mama make her bleak life bearable. But Rudy, her best friend, makes everything right in this world.
A snowball in the face is surely the perfect beginning to a lasting friendship.
 But their idyllic lives cannot stay that way forever. Food shortages are rampart, money becomes ever tighter and Papa's son believes every word from Hitler. 

And throughout all of this, Death watches.... and waits. 
Even death has a heart.
Whew. I have avoided this one for so long...and I'm so glad that I finally took the plunge.

Normally, I dislike most books/movies/games set in Nazi Germany.

I absolutely hate anything that turns that much pain and sorrow into a gimmick to sell more of the product. I feel that a majority of that entertainment field both cheapens the experience and is hugely disrespectful to the victims. 

I feel like this subject should be treated delicately - and there are very few bits of media that I feel do it justice.

The Book Thief was just absolutely perfect in that sense. This book was just the right mixture of joys and sorrows, of highs and lows, and of good and evil.

I loved Liesel and the way she grew up against the ever-present tide of Nazis. 

The way she and her family struggled against the world, by hiding a Jew or showing sympathy, really made this book shine.

Death made an interesting perspective, though I wish the book would have been narrated more from inside his head. 

Overall, loved this one. Though (and this may be just me), but am I the only one disappointed by the title?

I really was expecting a bit more book-thievery...instead Liesel was (mostly) given the very few books that she ""steals"".

1048,Deanna,Charlotte's Web,"Jul 31, 2015",5,"One of my favorite childhood memories is of reading this book with my mother. I remember how much I giggled at some of the funny situations and cried especially when we read it the first few times. Sobbing into my pillow with my mom rubbing my back I wondered why Charlotte had to die. My mom patiently explaining the gift Charlotte left for Wilbur. Even now I feel a bit of a lump in my throat. It was treasures like this that started my love of books and reading. 

I loved it so much I don't know how many times I read it over the years. Such a 
timeless classic that will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come. It was easy
to understand and I loved the illustrations. The characters were so well developed and completely lovable. I wanted to move to a farm right away and have my very own baby pig. So many life lessons... 

It was all in there! The meaning of true friendship, love, life's adventures, miracles, death, trust, betrayal, sorrow and the passing of time. Enjoyable to both children and adults I hope everyone reads this book at least once in their lives. Truly a timeless classic."

Liesel: Hi, I'm Liesel. I have no personality, but I'm a cute little girl. 

Death: Her name is not Liesel. Her name is THE BOOK THIEF and I shall name her that for the rest of the book.

Liesel: Even though I stole, like, 3 books in total or something. 

Death: Shut up, Book Thief.

Rudy: Hello everyone. Have you ever seen a lemon? That's what my hair looks like. 

Death: Here is a little information you should know: this books is filled with many interesting facts. Very relevant and everything. We shall kick off with the definition from the dictionary of the word lemon. 

Reader: The fuck? 

Death: A lemon is a vegetable that is very yellow and acid. That's what the Book Thief's friend's hair looks like.

Reader: That's not a very good description. That's how I picture Rudy now. (view spoiler)[
  
(hide spoiler)]

Death: Shut up and read so you can cry, reader.

*Intimidated reader keeps on reading*

Liesel: Papa!

Papa: Liesel. 

Death: Reader, are you crying yet?

Reader: Can you just stop that?

Death: What?

Reader: That. Popping up out of nowhere? 

Death: Get used to it. And keep on reading before I killz you! And woohoho, HERE'S A LITTLE FACT YOU SHOULD KNOW: This book is not gonna end well. 

Reader: Are you serious? You could have used spoiler tags, man! 

*Annoyed reader keeps on reading*

Liesel: Papa, can you play the accordion? 

Papa: Yes, Liesel. 

*Plays the accordion. Everyone else is bored*

Rudy: Hey, Saukerl. 

Death: Listen, reader. Saukerl means bitch, basically, but I suppose it's less brutal if they say it in German. HERE IS ANOTHER LITTLE FACT YOU SHOULD KNOW: A lot of random words will be in German for the sole purpose of making this book look smart and bilingual. But it really is useless as every, and I do mean EVERY word in German is immediately followed by the English translation.

Reader: Errrr. What's the point then? 

Death: Who said it has to be useful? I bet you're one of those ridiculous people who thinks a book has to have a plot? Or that characters have to be multi-dimensional? And you probably think that two metaphors per sentence is too much? Well, YOU ARE WRONG. This book will show you exactly how wrong you are.

Reader: Uh. Why did I pick up this book again?

Death: Because everyone luurved it. And you will, too.

Liesel: I don't know. I'm just bored.

Reader: So am I.

Rudy: Wanna go steal something?

Death: YO, READER. HAD YOU FORGOTTEN ME? HERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW. What the book thief and the lemon are about to do is going to end BADLY. You have the tissues ready?

Reader: What?

*Random shit happens*

Death: MUHAHAHAHA DIDN'T I SAY THAT WOULD HAPPEN?

Reader: I know. That's why I'm not crying. I kinda knew it, because you TOLD me EVERYTHING before it actually happened!

Death: Shut up and keep on reading.

Reader: But I'm already 524 pages in and nothing's happened yet! Sigh.

Rudy: Saukerl, wanna play football?

Liesel: Okay.

Death: I AM THE NARRATOR OF THE STORY AND THEREFORE I SHOULD BE TALKING AT ALL TIMES EVEN THOUGH I AM ACTUALLY INTERRUPTING THE NATURAL FLOW OF THE STORY.

Reader: Stop yelling at me. 

Death: This is an information you should know: This was Nazi Germany and A BOOK WAS SOON TO BE STOLEN.

Liesel: Oh, a book. That's nice. 

Death: SEE? IT IS NAZI GERMANY AND YET IT IS FULL OF BOOK THIEVERY.

Reader: Can you just stop glorifying book thievery? It's not that impressive. You make me expect something huge and it's not. So okay, she stole a book. BIG DEAL! It's not that amazing. Stop acting like it is.

Death: *glares*

Papa: Yes.

Death: Here are two informations that you should know. First, the definition from the dictionary of the word Dinner. Dinner is the main meal of the day, eaten in the evening or at midday. ...

Reader: This is a joke, right? What's the second information?

Death: A JEW IS COMING YOYOYO.

Reader: Thanks. I love to be surprised, so it's pretty cool to see how you spoil EVERYTHING. And practically nothing happens in the first place, so everything that COULD make me care for the book is now ruined. 

Max: Hello, everyone. I am sweet and clich√© and nice and Jewish. Love me?

*Seriously.*

Death: HEY HEY, EVERYONE IS DEAD.


Liesel: Except me! But I still don't have any personality whatsoever though. So it's not like I matter or anything. Go on, ignore me. *mumbles* I'm used to it anyway. *Fades away and everyone looks for a fuck to give, but no one can find any.*

1050,Hannah Azerang,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Feb 05, 2022",5,instantly a new all time favorite
1051,Michi,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Jun 11, 2007",2,"Very entertaining, but kind of made me gag. Everything was written in this faux-asian ""My heart ached like cherry blossom petals floating on the river..."" bullshit."
1052,Piyangie,Crime and Punishment,"Oct 07, 2018",5,"Crime and Punishment is one of the most heartfelt stories that I have read. Never a book is written about agonies of a human mind with so much compassion, sympathy, and feeling. There is no question as to Dostoevsky‚Äôs mastery in writing. The beauty and charm in his work mainly lie in his truthful and sincere portrayal of human psychology. But that is not all. He also paints a truthful and sincere picture of different classes of Russian society. The two elements combined produce such realistic stories that it never occurs to the reader that he is reading fiction. 

Set in St. Petersburg, the main plot in Crime and Punishment revolves around a murder committed by the protagonist, Raskolnikov. His mental agony at the horror and guilt of his action and his terror at being caught dominates the storyline. Raskolnikov is an ex-law student, whose mind is overstrained to the point of madness by his oppressive condition in life. So, when the murder was committed it looks as if the motive was to rob; but his later actions heavily contradict this conviction, and it is not clear what truly drove him to commit the hideous crime. There is however a hint here and there that Raskolnikov believed in the extremist socialist idea of ‚Äúkilling for common good‚Äù.

Raskolnikov is characterized as a proud and egoistic man with queer ideas about morality. On one hand, he justifies himself of committing the crime by saying that the victim is a worthless person, but on the other hand, he is burdened with guilt. His conflicting ideas constantly torture him. It is amazing how the author penetrates the criminal mind; the torment Raskolnikov goes through while planning, at the time of committing the murder, and afterward the crime is committed, is portrayed with such accuracy that although one cannot pardon him for the sin he has committed, it is hard not to feel sorry. It is also surprising that the amount of cunning that is displayed in such a tortured mind. Through all his agonies, Raskolnikov does play a very clever game at concealing his crime and evading the police. 

The story and characters all revolve around Raskolinikov; these supporting characters are chosen from different sections of Russian society. The psychological portrayal of these supporting characters transports you into their minds and makes you live in them so that every action of theirs is not read but felt. I enjoyed his choice of characters; their difference added colour and contrast to the story. Of them, I loved Avdoyta, the devoted sister of Raskolnikov, Razhumikhin, his true and loyal friend, and Sofya, his savior who shows him the path of redemption. 

There are few subplots intertwined with the main plot. Through them, Dostoevsky raises the issue of social conditions and the suffering of women. His sensitive and compassionate account of women‚Äôs position and suffering is heartbreaking. Their anguish, their pain is written so truthfully in those pages that I was crying my heart out as I read them. The character of Sofya is for whom I felt the most. She is forced into prostitution to provide for the family as his drunken father cannot keep to a good job. Then Katerina Ivanovna's suffering from consumption, all the while struggling to provide for her children, touches your heart. And Avdotya's being subject to unseemly sensual attention from the master of the house where she works as a governess, and her inability to leave her position as she was prepaid half her salary make you burn with indignation. It is shocking to read how unprotected women were legally and socially. And it is even more shocking that men like Pyotr and Svidrigailov, who have the power to help, victimizing the defenseless women to satisfy their own desires. The injustice of it all makes your blood boil. Dostoevsky through the characters of Pyotr, Svidrigailov, and Sofya‚Äôs father put men to shame.

There is also a social commentary on Russian society exposing the radical atheist ideas the progressive movement was advocating and the author‚Äôs anti-radical and piously religious views as against them. He seems to be criticizing heavily on the emerging socialist doctrines. 

I have always liked Dostoevsky‚Äôs outlook on life. There is so much humanity in it. And in Crime and Punishment it is well exhibited. 

It is a little wonder why Crime and punishment is called a masterpiece. It is complete in every sense and perfectly so. With each work, Dostoevsky makes me fall in love with him all over."

1055,Sean Barrs,Lord of the Flies,"Aug 10, 2018",4,"‚ÄúWe did everything adults would do. What went wrong?‚Äù



For me, this quote sums up the entire book. It‚Äôs a powerful exploration of humanity and the wrongness of our society and it also demonstrates the hypocrisy of war. Adults judge the behaviour of children, but are they really any better? I think not. 

The scary thing about this book is how real it is. The Lord of the Flies bespeaks the brilliance of realistic dystopian fiction, it gives you a possible world scenario, a bunch of very human characters and then it shows you want might happen when they are thrown into a terrible situation: they act like monsters (or humans?) What Golding shows us is that we are not so far from our primal nature, from our so called killer instincts, and all it takes is a little push out of the standard world we live in for us to embrace our darker side. 

The boys act in accordance with what they have seen in the world (though they don‚Äôt understand limits.) Power creates authority and violence is a way to achieve the peace you want. Sort of ironic isn‚Äôt it? They go to war amongst themselves and in doing so lose all sense of childhood innocence. They grow up. They learn what humans are capable of doing when pushed. They become ‚Äòsavages‚Äô and reject civilisation and create their own sense of community, though in another display of irony this in itself becomes a mini-civilisation- just a one of their own accord without any rules and a nasty child tyrant enthroned as chief. 

‚ÄúWhat are we? Humans? Or animals? Or savages?‚Äù 

The novel is rich in allegory to the point where it has been interpreted in so many different ways over the years. Like all great literature, it could mean lots of things and nothing at all. It‚Äôs a very clever piece of writing and it got me thinking a great deal about children and how we protect them from the realities of the world. It sort of says something to me, a quiet acknowledgement about how messed up things can be given the right circumstances and these children are so very quick to embrace it with unflinching enthusiasm (at least, when one of them leads the way.)

It‚Äôs a good book with a lot of ideas though at times I found the prose a little hard to follow. The dialogue is confusing at times and many of the children fade into the background with only a small few developing distinct personalities. I found the first part of the story particularly difficult to read, so in terms of the actual execution I think it could have been done a little better. I found myself wanting to edit sections of the text, which is not a place a reader should ever be in especially with a novel this revered by so many enthusiastic readers, critics and students. Maybe I‚Äôm just a little picky with word placement. 

Overall though, I‚Äôm glad I spent the time to revisit it. There are so many pop-culture references to this that a reminder was needed."
1056,Kevin Ansbro,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"May 15, 2016",5,"I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this book, and how much I adore the writing of Colombian author, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez.
His style, el realismo m√°gico (magical realism), transcends the frugal prose that mildews the pages of so many joyless books.
Salman Rushdie was, and still is, heavily influenced by M√°rquez. He described him as ""The greatest of us all.""
Louis de Berni√®res was similarly inspired by the great man.

I first read this book more than twenty years ago, and it has remained part of my authorial psyche ever since.
As with Rushdie's work, you can literally point a pin at any sentence in this book to reveal an imaginative genius that most of us could never aspire to. A newcomer to M√°rquez's work might be alarmed to see barely a paragraph break to each page. Don't worry, deep breath, you'll get used to it.

I reread this fantastically demented, wonderfully brilliant book last week, only for my wife to shoot me quizzical looks as I had a Harry Met Salvatora bookgasm while pouting at his dazzling prose, purring at his human imagery and ohhhh, licking my lips at his sumptuous outlandishness. Trigger warning: Those who are easily offended should give it a swerve; magical events do rub shoulders with some very disturbing realities. 

There is one line on the book's back cover, penned by The Times newspaper, that sums up this masterpiece perfectly:
""Sweeping, chaotic brilliance, often more poetry than prose ... one vast and musical saga.""

So there you have it, a book so momentous that I will revisit it a few more times in my lifetime before I eventually pop my clogs."

Before I expound on the redemptive, grace/face/rating saving virtues of second half of the book, I need to rant vent a bit regarding what turned my hackles all red and puffy. 

THE SIN:

I am a SF dystopian connoisseur and I love a well-conceptualized ‚Äúworld in the shitter‚Äù set up. I am happy if the author wants to make the dystopian vision the narrative centerpiece and explore the subtle nuances of day to day life throughout the story (e.g., 1984, The Jagged Orbit or The Windup Girl). I am also just fine if the author wants to simply grab our attention with a dystopian world and use it as a springboard for introducing us to the story they ‚Äúreally want to tell‚Äù (e.g., Sea of Glass, Genesis, Native Tongue and Parable of the Sower).

For me these dark, distorted mirrors of our present do not need to stand up to nit-picking dissection or rigorous extrapolative analysis. It just has to be sufficient to allow my sense of disbelief to see it, smell it and give it a once over before kicking its feet up and suspending itself for the rest of the story. 

Houston‚Ä¶we have a problem‚Ä¶.my disbelief wasn‚Äôt ameliorated. 

It rolled its eyes, squinched its nose, got up and packed a suitcase and then went fishing‚Ä¶leaving me in the precarious position of trying to read the novel while banging my head against the wall trying to help the world-building maneuver in past my logic circuits. 

Twas a painful failure as this was not a believable dystopia. I remember having a similar problem with Shusterman‚Äôs Unwind, but, in that case, the premise was so darned intriguing that I was able to run with it anyway. Here, the central world-building concept is‚Ä¶..completely‚Ä¶.and utterly‚Ä¶.and (almost) unforgivably‚Ä¶horrendous. It felt desperately silly and poorly thought-through. The dystopia‚Äôs premise didn‚Äôt pass even a drive-by smell test. 

In essence, the author simply replaced one set of arbitrary and ridiculous divisions with another. Thus, rather than people being irrationally and stupidly being divided by social lines, ethnic lines, racial lines, religious lines, familial lines, political lines, wealth lines, geographical lines, educational lines, ‚Ä¶Roth created a brand new but even MORE arbitrary division that makes even less sense than the original and doesn‚Äôt even allow for ‚Äúcross-over‚Äù appeal by making each faction exclusive. Therefore, by their very existence, these group are inherently laden with friction and must, by definition, clash with one another which guaranteeing the fomenting of further discord and the creation of an even shittier world. 

The logic escaped me and this was a major, major failure.. 
 
Worse, the dystopian element was not even bizarrely interesting (as it was for me with Shusterman‚Äôs Unwind). Thus, in addition to be nonsensical, it lacked the ‚Äúgrab you‚Äù factor that might have allowed me to tell my brain to pipe down and just go with it. So, for a dystopia-lover like me, this was a steep hill to climb. 





Now, on the average to good side, the writing was fine. It wasn‚Äôt lush or pleasing enough to make reading the words in themselves fun, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt clunky or distracting to the story either. I would call it invisible which is just fine for a story like this and I felt the same way while reading stories like The Hunger Games. Good, solid prose and doesn‚Äôt make a nuisance of itself and creates an environment conducive to good story-telling. 

THE REDEMPTION: 

It starts with Tris who, like Katniss and Anaximander (from Genesis) before her, wormed her way into my heart and smote it with her buckets full of awesomeness. She was smart, confident, courageous and an ass-kicker extraordinaire. My kind of heroine. She picked up this struggling story with an ill-formed back-story, looked me in the eyes and said, ‚ÄòStephen, I‚Äôm gonna make you like this story anyway because I‚Ä¶am‚Ä¶simply‚Ä¶that‚Ä¶cool.‚Äô 

She was‚Ä¶she did‚Ä¶I did.

As Beatrice during the first half of the book, I was mostly under whelmed, but I fell hard for Tris once she entered the picture and she made me forget, by and large, my earlier misgivings. Insecure scared and questioning yet decisive, brave and loyal. Plus a volcanic temper that was just terrific. She was well-drawn, well shaded and felt very, very real. 

As good as Tris is I don‚Äôt want to pin the entire comeback on her sack-squelching shoulders. The story itself ramped up and really gained momentum in the second half when the various pieces started to fall into place. I loved the ‚Äúbig reveal‚Äù and was impressed with how the scope of the plot slowly but inexorably grew until we had a story that was truly epic. 

CONCLUSION:

Had I not been so off put by the ‚Äúsins‚Äù of the early part of the book, I think this would have been a strong 4 star effort. As it is, I think the second half of the book was excellent and sets itself up very well for the next installment. Add to that a truly engaging, endearing character in Tris that the reader can fully connect with and I think this series has the potential to be very strong going forward. 

3.0 stars. Recommended."
1059,Kai Spellmeier,Twilight ,"Apr 02, 2015",0,"While I truly loved this series once upon a time and still have a soft spot for it, I also want to acknowledge that the love story at its centre is inherently toxic and gets even worse in the later books. Meyer also stands accused of exploiting Quileute culture, and moreover I'm annoyed about the author's racism, which showed when she blocked the director of the first film from casting anyone who wasn't white for the Cullens. So you know, there's all that.

1060,Seth T.,The Da Vinci Code ,"Jun 28, 2007",2,"For cheap supermarket fiction, this sure was cheap supermarket fiction. It would have helped if this was the first book I had ever read. Unfortunately, having read Curious George as a child (a towering work of literary genius by comparison), The DaVinci Code suffered perhaps unjustly."
1061,Jim Fonseca,Crime and Punishment,"Nov 11, 2011",5,"What can I add to 7000+ reviews (at the time I write)? I think this book is fascinating because of all the topic it covers. Like the OJ trial, it is about many important interconnected things and those things remain important today, even though this book was originally published in 1865.

Sure, it has a lot about crime and punishment. But also insanity and temporary insanity, the latter a legal plea that could be entered in Russia of the mid-1800's. It's about guilt and conscience, long before Freud. In fact, this book was written at a time when psychological theories were coming into vogue. It's about false confessions. It's about poverty and social class and people who rise above their class and people who fall from the class they were born into. It's about the wild dreams and the follies of youth.

There is also mention of many social theories that were in vogue at that time, so, for example, if you want to, you can click on Wikipedia to find out about ""Fourier's system"" and his phalansteres. There is attempted rape, blackmail, child labor, child prostitution, child marriage and child molestation. There is discussion of marrying for money. There are ethnic tensions between Russians and the Germans of St. Petersburg. Should you give to charity or should you give to change the conditions that caused the poverty? Like me, you may have thought that was a modern idea, but here it is, laid out in 1865. There's a lot about alcoholism. Stir in a cat-and-mouse detective and a bit of Christian redemption. No wonder this is a classic."

1063,Melanie,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Dec 17, 2009",4,"‚ÄúIt was a dark and stormy night...‚Äù

 
Okay, I haven‚Äôt read A Wrinkle in Time since fifth grade, so I was kind of nervous going into this. Yet, I was very pleasantly surprised, and I‚Äôm even more excited to see the new movie adaptation in March! I mean, this reads a little ‚Äúold‚Äù and ‚Äúsimple‚Äù but it was still such a delight to read. I will say that I didn‚Äôt remember any of the religious/spiritual aspects that were woven in, so apparently fifth grade Melanie, who went to a Catholic school and everything, just pushed those out of her mind throughout the years. 

The basic premise of A Wrinkle in Time, that I‚Äôm sure you all know, stars a young girl named Meg is one of four siblings in her family, and both of her parents are scientists. Meg and Charles are very intelligent, therefore outcasts, but where their twin siblings, who are of normal IQ, fit in just fine. One day, her father goes missing and Meg, Charles, and their new friend, Calvin, meet a very peculiar trio, who take them on an intergalactic adventure that they will never forget. They essentially travel by folding or ‚Äúwrinkling‚Äù time. 

Overall, this was a super enjoyable read, that totally did give me a swift kick in the nostalgia feels. Yet, I‚Äôm not sure how well it would hold up if this was your first time experiencing the story. I do feel like there is a little something here for everyone, and even though this is considered a middle grade book, I do think it holds up pretty well for most ages. And honestly? Even reading this in 2018, this is still a very unique book. 



‚ÄúThere will no longer be so many pleasant things to look at if responsible people do not do something about the unpleasant ones.‚Äù

 
This is a story about love, and family, and faith, and being able to think for yourself. I can totally understand why this is a literary classic, and I‚Äôm so happy I reread it! And now I‚Äôm totally pumped for the movie!

I don't believe you for a second that you didn't enjoy it if you happened to have ratings and long rants about the following books.

Accept it! Stephanie Meyer kept you reading her very long books! And you are only complaining about stalking tendencies because YOU know this is fiction. 

I DON'T WANT A GUY WATCHING ME SLEEP. In real life that's creepy.

BELLA COULD HAVE GOTTEN HERSELF KILLED MULTIPLES TIMES IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR EDWARD's STALKER tendencies. Again in real life I don't want to date a stalker. In a fictional realm some things are necessary to keep the woman a vampire loves alive and the readers turning the pages.

AND IF STEPHANIE MEYER IS SUCH A BAD WRITER BY ALL MEANS GO AND WRITE A BETTER BOOK. Good luck with that!Let's see how many agents push for your book.

Now don't you like junk food? Do you really only eat select cuisine? Admit it! You put crazy stuff in your McDonalds french fries and then claim is the most delicious thing ever! Not every meal has to be a delicattessen and not every read has to become the next War and peace. You just don't read the book.

I find the people who says I'm stupid because I ADORE TWILIGHT to be snobbish, arrogant and insufferable. 

I like twilight and I'm proud I like twilight. Plenty of people wouldn't read or write if it hadn't been for twilight. The publishing industry would have lost money if girls like me hadn't started reading book like twilight. Millions of women around the world got to love twilight and they're not stupid, they just don't share your taste in books.

1069,Lisa of Troy,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Mar 30, 2022",3,"Hi All My Introverted Friends!!!!

Charlie is a freshman in high school where he meets Sam and Patrick. With the help of Sam, Patrick, and his trusty English lit teacher, Charlie tries to navigate the awkward teenage years.

The Perks of Being A Wallflower is told in a collection of letters with Charlie writing to Dear Friend, someone that he has never met before but heard was a really great listener. 

The listening part really got to me because I have realized that most people don‚Äôt really listen. When someone sends me a letter, I read it over at least three times. I want to make sure that I‚Äôm not reading anything into it, not hearing what I want to hear. I want to understand what the other person is saying and not saying. It seems that nowadays people are really distracted with pings, dings, and notifications. 

The Perks of Being a Wallflower started off strongly, and it made me laugh several times. Plus, it mentioned Walden, my second favorite book, quite a few times. Always bonus points for mentioning Walden. 

However, this is a coming-of-age story, and this trope has been done a lot of times. The competition is fierce. The ending was unexpected and didn‚Äôt seem to fit in with the coming-of-age theme. ‚ÄúCry‚Äù was mentioned 104 times! And this book isn‚Äôt even that long‚Ä¶.

As an introvert (according to an online quiz 97% introvert), I was disappointed with Charlie. Some well-intentioned person decided to coach him on some of his social skills. However, why didn‚Äôt Charlie just come out and embrace his awkwardness? Why didn‚Äôt Charlie just say, ‚ÄúHey, I am always going to come up with an excuse not to go on the Team dinners‚Äù? Not everyone is going to be the life of the party, and why can‚Äôt society stop trying to turn introverts into extroverts? We aren‚Äôt extroverts-in-training! There is nothing wrong with valuing a deep relationship with one or two people rather than spending our time enduring vapid conversations with a bunch of random strangers that we probably won‚Äôt ever see again.

1070,Tucker  (TuckerTheReader),The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Jan 07, 2019",4,"What a weird little book.

Something I'll do, almost immediately after finishing a book, is Google the heck out of the genre it belongs to. For example, after finishing Furiously Happy, I wanted to find a book that would make me laugh as much as it did. When in doubt, turn to Google. I have googled ""most funny books"" , ""funny fiction books"" and "" comedy books"". Each time, this was one of the top results. And since, I got Audible for Christmas, I thought I would give it a try. (But also because Google is shoving it down my throat.)

I'm still not totally sure how I feel about it. I keet waffling. One chapter, I'd be laughing and thinking I would definitely rate it 5 Stats but the next, I would be bored and wanted to rate it 3. (I decided on 3.5 stars).

This book is described as sci-fi AND comedy. A very very weird combo. I like both of those genres separately but together they were just weird. I love chocolate and I love grilled cheese but would I put them together? Heck, no. (Well, I might but I've been known to have weird food combos. Cheese and chocolate. Eggs and syrup. Apple's and chips.)

Aside from the genres, the plot was very creative. They story open a with the end. The end of earth. Two aliens and two aliens the travel the Universe and hilarity ensues. That's all fine and good but then the book just ended. I can only describe at as like when your walking and reading and you run into a wall and your nose gets all scraped up. (Not that that's happened to me or anything üò∂)

All in all, I have very mixed feelings. I loved the idea and the humor. I also loved the sci-fi aspect but when all of that was combined it was not all that great

1072,Tharindu Dissanayake,Charlotte's Web,"Sep 10, 2020",5,"""Slowly, slowly!"" said Charlotte. ""Never hurry and never worry!""

Charlotte's Web is one of those books that anyone can enjoy, irrespective of our age. Language might be very simple and plain, but once you picked up this, you will quickly find out that this is probably one of the best stories you have ever read. Author not only brings the readers a lot of fun with this little story, but also has a very subtle way of conveying a few of life lessons. And as for children, I believe, letting them experience such pure perspectives on life will assist them see the world quite differently - in a better way.

Here's the Written Review!



Can you hear me screaming?

As expected, the illustrations brought this book to¬†a whole new level.¬†I legitimately want to buy another copy, solely to take it apart and¬†frame it.

Each page is just bursting with new life.¬†Honestly, how could you¬†not¬†love such beautiful images?


Hogwarts, Hogwarts. Hoggy Hoggy warty warts.

I think at this point, everyone and their great-great-grandmother has heard of this book.

Harry Potter, orphaned before he was one, was sent to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. He was always a bit of¬†an odd child¬†- much to his family's dismay.

Things just...¬†happened¬†...around him. Like when he was running from bullies and jumped to the school roof. Or when he got an atrocious haircut (courtesy of Aunt Petunia) and all of his hair grew back in a single night.

On his eleventh birthday, a letter comes to him and¬†a whole new world opens¬†in front of his eyes.

In short - I LOVED THIS ONE. I thought I loved the Harry Potter books when I first read them, but when I bought the illustrated version...well, that love instantly quadrupled.

The fully illustrated Philosopher's Stone still has all the wonder and amazement as the boy-turned-wizard embarks on a harrowing 7-book-adventure and the illustrations bring a whole new dimension.

Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how much I love this book.¬†Just look at these images - they're magnificent:


Ahh! Just look at sad, tiny Harry. Don't worry kid - life will get better!

Not only are these¬†full-color, high quality images¬†but there are so¬†many¬†of them.

Often, illustrated books have a picture here or there but not HP. There's¬†pages and pages of pictures¬†like this - and often the pages without full-sized images will have a small illustrations here and there between the large ones.

Words cannot express how highly I recommend this one. If you haven't read HP recently...I¬†strongly urge¬†you to check out this book.

1075,Richard,Charlotte's Web,"Sep 01, 2012",4,"I have been familiar with the story for most of my life, but never read it until now.

Wilbur the pig is born a runt, and the farmer decides he must face the axe. Kind-hearted little Fern intercedes and saves him. She cares for the undersized pig, who later goes to a nearby farm. Wilbur's life is nearly idyllic until he discovers the fate that has been woven for him: he will likely be the next Christmas ham. Horrified, he looks desperately for a door of escape. His pleas for help are overhead by a large grey spider who is almost invisible in the doorway. She decides to try to alter the thread by which his destiny is hanging, but will she succeed?

The barnyard animals, while displaying some human characteristics--Charlotte the spider can read and even has a smattering of Latin--behave like the animals they are. The geese are noisy and silly; the rat is sly and greedy; the pig is good-natured and always hungry; the spider, while kindly, is also an opportunistic and bloodthirsty killer

The story is one of friendship, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. While at times it threatens to cross over into a sort of Victorian sentimentality, it never quite does, because the author injects touches of humour and irony into the portrayal of both animal and human characters."
1076,Stephen,The Little Prince,"Aug 15, 2010",3,"A ""Daddy/Daughter nighttime reading hour"" review

This was a toughy for me to review. I wasn't sure of the best perspective from which to provide comments so as to be of assistance to my fellow readers since this is a children's book (rather than YA which would be reviewed purely on its own merits). After a short session of ""what should I do,"" I bravely decided to punt, figuring that there are already more than enough excellent reviews of this without my clogging up the cyber arteries with another one. Therefore, I decided simply to share my experience of reading/listening to the book with my daughter along with a couple of thoughts on the concepts discussed in the story and hope that you can take something useful from it. 

So as part of our nightly routine, my youngest daughter, Sydney, and I have daddy/princess read time. The other night, she and I listened to the audio version of The Little Prince while we read along with a copy of the book. As usual, it was an AMAZING experience. I am convinced that I learn more about the stories we read from her and her reactions to the narrative than she does from me...and I love it. 

It's only a two hour audio (86 pages) and yet the two of us spent close to 4 hours listening and talking about the various chapters in the story (plus a brief 15 minute break for Mom to give her a bath while Dad helped big sister Kenzie with her math homework). Sydney had all kinds of questions (some just hysterically funny in how much sense they made from a kid-centric view of the world). We would stop the story after each planet or character to talk about what she thought the story meant and what messages the story was trying to deliver. 
For those of you with children, you know how wonderful this can be and I was on the ninth cloud watching my little girl ponder over the book. 

From this perspective, the story was perfect and deserves an easy 5 stars. However, since it's not very helpful to rate a book based on that kind of non-transferable experience, I didn't want to rely solely on that for its final rating. 

After explaining to Syd the goodreads star system, she would give this 4 stars as she really liked the British accent of the narrator and the crazy adventures the Prince experiences on the various planets. BTW, from Sydney's point of view, 4 stars is the absolute ceiling for any book dealing with ickies like boys and this would easily earn 5 stars had the story been called the ""The Little Princess."" Princes are still second class citizens at this stage in her life...and Dad is oh, oh, OH so perfectly fine with that).

For me, looking at this sans Sydney, I liked it but was not smitten with it enough to go higher than 3 stars. The story is well written and has something to say about the human condition and how people spend too much of their lives focusing on the wrong things and not enough time enjoying where they are. A nice message and one I was happy to expose Sydney to, but I was not always enamored with the path the author took to get there. 

Overall, a good read on its own and a potentially a great experience if shared with your children...as most things in life are. 

3.5 stars."

They've had to go through so much more in their lifetime than a lot of teenagers will ever have to, and its aged them. And quite honestly, this book wouldn't be as good if they were ""normal"" (whatever that means) 
*sighs* okay I'm done, proceed with reading. If you want to, I'm just tiny words on a screen. Do whatever you want.


As much of an amazing writer as I want to be.... I'm really not. So I'll just point out the things that made this book amazing. ;)
I knew that I would cry so I really didn't bother swearing not to cry. What I didn't expect is bawling my eyes out. I really didn't. John Green has done an amazing job of making these characters feel so real to me. When they cried, I cried (bawled). When they laughed, I laughed. When they melted, I melted. Their romance was so epic and I know, I KNOW, that this is a book I will read over and over again and cry every single time.

 The characters were perfection! Especially Augustus Waters. Not only is his name Augustus (which is epic in itself) He had the guts to go up to Hazel and just straight up ask her to come hang out with him. Nice guys finish last? I think not.

 You know this book was so awesmazing that I gave it its own tag. Just look up there and you'll see a little tag that says ""the-fault-in-our-stars"". It was THAT amazing. Seriously. So amazing that I'm pretty sure it was my first heartbreak... from a book. I really haven't felt that much from a book, much less a person, in a very long time. (I'm kind of a loner and a commitment phob... not a good mix) But my heart didn't just do this 3, it did this ¬ª *BOOM!* (didn't have a sign for that)

I wish I could write more about this book, but I just can't explain the amazingness of it with my simple, unworthy words, so I am going to tell you what you NEED to do....

1080,Sofia,Crime and Punishment,"Mar 25, 2022",5,"An examination of the psychology of a murderer, Crime and Punishment delves into the darkest depths of the mind, where tangled threads of hatred and paranoia and torment weave together to form a man such as Raskolnikov. Insignificant but too proud to admit it, he believes he is above trivial morality. But there is some tortured compassion in him, although it all but vanishes as he commits the titular Crime. Spiraling deeper and deeper into madness and resentment, Raskolnikov isolates himself and continues his desperate narcissism to the bitter end. His intensifying anxiety and terror, paired with his exaggerated belief in his own importance, drive him to increasingly severe breakdowns. Raskolnikov retreats into the uneasiness of his own mind, his fears threatening to overwhelm him. 

Is there inherent evil in humankind? We all have hatred inside of us, but what defines us? What defines Raskolnikov? His moments of selfless generosity or his sudden, formidable rage? Should we be content to suffer from an endless helix of our innate capacity for violence? 

I highly recommend the translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. It captures Dostoevsky's eloquent voice without compromising the urgency and anxiety of the novel.

I suppose pretty much everyone knows the heartbreaking story of Lennie and George. I was relatively 'unspoiled' and still knew what happened in the end. I just did not know how or why, but figured out those pretty quickly into the book. And still that did not help the sense of impending doom that was like one protracted gut punch. I think that says something about the masterful writing - where the story takes over so much that you keep reading despite the clear sense of where it is going, without having to rely on suspense or twists - instead, going forward just on the impact of the story itself""I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn't ought to of let no stranger shoot my dog.""I used to work with Special Education kids some time ago. And I have seen first-hand what Steinbeck describes in Of Mice and Men - the childlike vulnerability and innocence often combined with physical strength, just waiting for something bad to happen. The children we took care of - some of which topped my 5'3'' frame by a foot or so and outweighed me by a good hundred pounds (but despite that a few times I had to physically put myself on between them and a smaller child) - had, unlike Lennie, the society that is determined to protect them. They were luckier than poor George's charge. But I could not help but picture some of them, who have forever secured spots in my heart, in place of Lennie Small, feeling nothing but dread and sadness. Lennie, who is as innocent as one gets, and yet as much of a unwilling menace as one can be. And it was soul-crushing.

I think the impact of this story was that it did not have me taking sides. I felt bad for Lennie. I felt awful for Curley's wife who does not even have a NAME in this story. I felt sad for George and what he had to do. And I felt bad for the whole bunch of men who had names and stories, and a woman who got one but not the other.""You God damn tramp,"" be said viciously. ""You done it, di'n't you? I s'pose you're glad. Ever'body knowed you'd mess things up. You wasn't no good. You ain't no good now, you lousy tart.""And that's where this book lost stars for me. Curley's wife, the unwilling almost-antagonist/victim of this story. The woman who had no name except for the possessive one of her husband whose property - and therefore trouble for everyone else - she was viewed as. It seemed that she was the one getting the blame, not as much the crazy volatile husband of hers. After all, she *asked* for trouble, didn't she? At least that's the nagging feeling I got from this story, from the way her character was handled, from the way it was repeatedly stated that a 'tart' like her meant trouble for a man. Blame-the-victim mentality does not sit well with me, and I can't help but think that Steinbeck did that. (view spoiler)[And the words, 'Poor bastard' that George utters over her corpse, thinking of Lennie - not about the young woman who was brutally murdered, but of Lennie, the murderer - those made me so sad for the victim that did not get her share of sadness (hide spoiler)]. 

This book is definitely a classic with a profound impact on the reader, a short read that is in no way easy. It deserves the fame and recognition that it has enjoyed for quite a few years. 3.5 stars from me (it would have been 4.5 stars, but for the literary treatment of Curley's wife)."
1082,Anne,The Princess Bride,"Jan 03, 2009",5,"I was introduced to The Princess Bride through the movie.
And I cannot be the only one. 



Here's the thing: it's basically exactly like the movie but with one notable difference.
It's not Grandpa Columbo reading the book to his sick grandson, it's narrated by the author who is editing a book by ""S. Morgenstern"" to take out all the boring parts so his son will read it.
See, this was his favorite book as a child because his father read it to him. But what he didn't realize at the time was that his father had skipped over all the dull political satire that Morgenstern had written about his native land, Florin.



And it's Goldman's running dialogue throughout the book that really makes this the classic that it is, as he fully immerses himself in Morgenstern's tale.
The rest (minus a few minor things) you already know. Or I would assume you already know because WHO HASN‚ÄôT seen The Princess Bride movie?!



Recommended for anyone who loves adventure, swordfights, villains, revenge, friendship, magic, and of course‚Ä¶true love.



The End."
1083,Corrie,Little Women,"Mar 27, 2008",5,"The book begins:


""Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents, grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.

It's so dreadful to be poor! sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.

I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all, added little Amy, with an injured sniff.

We've got Father and Mother, and each other, said Beth contentedly from her corner.""

There's an undercurrent of anger in this book and I think Louisa May Alcott would have gone much further with it if her publisher had allowed it and if it weren't a children's book.

Louisa herself was fiercely independent and didn't marry. Of course, Jo, her doppelganger and the heroine of the book, did marry. I think the struggle for girls and women to be themselves while following convention is an experience that resonates today. I also think that, ironically, when people today want to return to the simple life, they all forget that there was no simple life. Although youngest sister Amy carries her books to school, writes with an inkwell and fights over pickled limes, her father is fighting a real war fought for ideology and national unity. Martha Stewart has us searching for the ""good things"" and harkening back to garden bounties but nineteenth century girls and women were nearly bound to the home. 

Young boys and girls might find the domesticity in the book offputting but it was necessary for people to have domestic skills or they could not survive. The working poor in the 1860s, like the working poor today, could not afford maids. Louisa May Alcott's family occasionally made money from making and mending clothing just to get by. I think there was just as much screaming as crying going on in the Alcott household, but Louisa tones things down for the March family.

The March family and the sisters made me yearn for my own sisters which never materialized. I also realized that wanting to draw, paint, play music, perform plays and write were interests that I shared with people of another time period. The book itself was written after the Civil War and has a purposeful nostalgic tone. 

Jo scribbles in the attic and relishes the time she has to write but she is expected to work as a caretaker for her elderly aunt. None of these girls are independently wealthy and the poverty that Alcott writes about in the book mirrors the poverty of her own life but she softens the reality for her fiction. Alcott's father Amos Bronson Alcott was not a soldier, yet he was often away from home. He was a dynamic lecturer and a revolutionary educator who was disillusioned by public reaction to some of his innovations and was often jobless.

While a good portion of white northerners were against slavery and wanted more rights for black Americans, they did not go as far as the Alcotts did in their support. I wish that she had written more about their anti-slavery positions. 
It's also not widely known that Bronson Alcott was shunned for educating black students.

Reading Little Women in fourth grade caused me to work as a historical interpreter at the Orchard House for six years many years later. I visited Fruitlands, the Old Manse, the Wayside and the House of the Seven Gables. I studied transcendentalism and learned about the contributions of Elizabeth Peabody and other great female intellectuals of the nineteenth century. I was forever changed after reading the book and I've reread it too many times to count. 

Louisa was a master marketer akin to J.K. Rowling. She also had a strong survival instinct like Rowling. She desperately needed to make money and writing was her one marketable skill. Notably, she was able to write the book under her own name and not use a gender neutral pseudonym.

The book is written for a younger audience and older readers reading it for the first time might not feel a connection with the book because all Victorian children's books were infused with a heavy dose of morality. Girls especially have always been told to endure hardships while remaining happy. My grandmother Ethel, who grew up in the 1930s, told me her mother said to her: ""It's easy to be happy when life rolls along like a song. But it's the girl who's worthwhile who will smile when everything goes wrong."""

Dear Orson Scott Card,


There are over 3,310,480,700 women in this world.



Sincerely, Women. 


Dear Fans of This Book Who Are Probably About To Make An Angry Comment On This Review:

Please leave now if you don't want to get all huffy and insulted and make a comment defending the author or whatever other shit that is this book. 
Or, if you want, go ahead. If you're going to comment, at least read the whole review and not just a quarter of it. I'm so sick of repeating myself over and over in the comments. 
Yes, I bash the author first, but I do make my points on why I hated the book itself, and not just because of him.

Thank you. 

Sincerely, Kat. 


First of all, before I get into the book, I'd like to say that Orson Scott Card is one of the biggest dicks on this Earth. For those of who don't know, he is openly homophobic and a hyprocrite (www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_... )). He is a Chauvinist (known to believe that women are the weaker sex and were only put on this world to make babies). He is a Mormon that, from what I've heard from people who've read his other books, tries to convert you in his own writing in his novels. 

Just for this author's personality, this book deserves one star. 

But now onto the actual book, which deserves one star in itself.


The Author's Viewpoints Leak In

It starts out well enough. It's interesting and keeps your attention. But immediately, the sexism shows its ugly face;


""All the boys are organized into armies.""
""All boys?""
""A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them.""

Keep in mind that this book is supposed to take place in the future. There are several things wrong with this sentence. 

1. In this day and age, thousands of women are in the military and fighting for their country. They have been for decades now, and longer still. So if this is supposed to be in the future, does Card think that women will give up their ability to fight so easily? 

 

2. Centuries of evolution working against them? On what terms? That we have ovaries? That we can have babies so are therefore unfit to fight or have the mental capacity to pass the tests boys can easily pass? 




This is the 21st century, genius. Women work. Women are in the army. Get your head out of your ass and look around, for fuck's sakes. 


Characters

I feel that Card made all the characters far too young. Ender is six, Valentine is eight, and Peter is ten. Peter has a fetish for torturing squirrels and threatening to kill his siblings. 
Um, okay? Is there any explanation for this strange behavior? No, because according to this book, all our kids in the future are fully functioning psychopaths. (Except the girls, of course. They're too 'mild' for behavior like that.)
In the future, the army is apparently full of kids barely older than six, up to age twelve. To be trained for a war that, as far as I could tell from the point I got to, was already won. 

Writing

The writing was atrocious. Card switches from third person perspective to first person constantly. The first person switches are for the character's 'thoughts', but the words aren't italicized or anything so you can never tell. 
To me, that's a sign of bad writing. If you can't stick with one kind of perspective, than you should go back to those non-existent creative writing classes. 

Plot 

Towards the middle of the book, the plot started to seriously drag and get outright ridiculous. Valentine and Peter start planning to 'take over the world' by writing fucking debate columns. Not only is the whole 'let's rule the world' concept highly overused, it's poorly planned out. It's randomly thrown into the story like, ""Okay, we need more villains and more things happening, so let's make the ten year old girl and twelve year old murderous boy try to take over the world!......with debate columns."" 




Sure. 


Then, switching back to Ender, who is now nine years old and a commander of his own kid army, we have our main character turning into the bullying idiots that bullied him in the beginning of the book. Has he learned nothing? Oh sure, it makes the kids 'better soldiers'. They're not even seven years old, they are not fucking soldiers. The whole story is a fucked up version of a 'kid military' which is run by controlling adults who don't want the war to end so they can remain in power. 
It--just--ugh. 

It got so tedious and irritating that I decided to give up on it. I'm not going to waste my time with a book written by a sexist, homophobic, dickwad. I'm not even going to see the movie, which is a real shame because I love Asa Butterfield. I feel bad that he was brought into such a stupid book/movie business."
1085,Rory,Little Women,"Jul 30, 2007",1,"** spoiler alert **
           I hated this book.

I can't even begin to go into all the reasons I dislike this novel. It's dull and preachy through out most of it--aside from Jo who is a truly inspired character. But everyone else seems one note, most of the chapters come off as morality plays than solid scenes or plots. And just when Miss Alcott has something seemingly interesting she breaks it for no other reason than to do something.

Whether its the pairing of Amy and Laurie (huh?), the point made CONSTANTLY that Beth's life isn't useless because she is an angel and showed them that angels do exist and is a total Mary Sue(Really? Cause I'm glad she died before I died of boredom), the forced pairing of Jo and the Professor (Why? I mean--really... Just keep her single) there is also the message that pursing art is selfish. (Jo giving up her writing, Laurie gives up his music, Amy gives up her sketching...) 

It's not a message I expected--this book is always lauded as one that has inspired countless girls... To do what? Because outside of Jo's sipirt I dont really see much to aspire to in this tsory? The overall message seems to be that as a good Christian one should sacrifice being an artist, being in love with who you want and any hope of independence... 

It's not because I'm from the modern era that I dislike this book. (Or that I'm an adult reading it.) If you look at other works being done in the same time period you will see that there were stories with less moralizing being done--including by Miss Alcott herself. I was just really disappointed"
1086,Rochelle ‚úø,Les Mis√©rables,"Feb 03, 2021",4,"If there ever was a book that took me by surprise, it would be Les Mis√©rables. And I am not just talking about the many plot twists.

This book contains, quite possibly, the largest number of literary themes and personas I have ever encountered in just one single body of work. Rogues, rebels, police officers, prostitutes, bishops, the poor, the rich, social injustice, love, hate, compassion, redemption, death... All merged together into one gigantic mishmash of storylines and character backgrounds and set up against the background of the political uproar following the French Revolution.

 The central character, ex-convict Jean Valjean, is one of the best characters I have ever read about. After stealing bread to save his sister's starving children, he is sent to the galleys to waste away as a slave for years and years. His trauma is hinted at in every corner of this book, and it is all so beautifully done. The arc of redemption Hugo gave him kept me hooked until the very last chapter.


""A few minutes only separated Jean Valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for the third time. And the galleys now meant not only the galleys, but Cosette lost to him forever; that is to say, a life resembling the interior of a tomb.""


Jean's story alone would have kept me reading, but Les Mis√©rables throws new characters your way any time you are not expecting it ‚Äî bringing new bits of philosophy and insight into the human psyche as they come. Each character is connected to Jean in some way, but also has enough distinct features and characteristics to never fall into the background. Gavroche, for example, only really becomes important to the storyline once the June Rebellion starts; however, I spent enough time reading about him to know exactly who he is and what he stands for.

This book made me cry (multiple times, oops); as the title states, this is anything but a happy story. But the author's humor shines through very often too. At times, the characters are made fun of; at others, there is some light-hearted remark or witty dialogue to lighten the mood:


""Monseigneur, you who turn everything to account have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It would be better to grow salads there than bouquets.""
""Madame Magloire,"" retorted the Bishop, ""you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the useful."" He added after a pause, ""More so perhaps.""


The pacing is slow. Very slow. Which shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, as the page count is what the story is notorious for. I took the book with me and read it everywhere: in a city apartment on the 46th floor, outside in the garden, and even on the boat I took a trip with last summer. Luckily, the story is divided into ""books"", which are in turn divided into small chapters. It makes reading this more manageable. And even when you aren't particularly invested in a certain chapter or character, there's always pretty writing to look at!

The sole reason I can't give Les Mis√©rables ALL of the stars is because I am very strict when it comes to five-star ratings. I sure as hell won't be re-reading this book. I think. Plus, those endless chapters with elaborate explanations of battle strategies, Waterloo, and sewers did not impress me. As much as I appreciate the way Hugo's mind worked, I would have liked to see him stray less from the actual plot. Hugo's area of expertise is very clearly the flip side of life in 19th century Paris, but I could have done with a little less information.

That said, read this book. Please. Maybe an abridged version, though.


""Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry.""

Additional Notes:
- It took me so damn long to finish this book that I'm starting to think my reading slump was partially caused by it. Literally a book hangover
- The fact that I read this over lockdown makes me even more attached to it, I think. I'd recommend this to anyone with a bit of time on their hands :)"

I worry at times when reading classic books because I feel I won't understand a lot of them. And some I haven't. Come to think of it, I have read books that aren't classic and never understood them and still loved them. I'm strange, I know. 

I felt the same way when I went into The Count of Monte Cristo. I was so worried I wouldn't get it enough to like it and uh, it's one of my favorite books to date! 

Les Mis has given me some trouble during the first of the book. I have felt like I'm not going to like it too much and then there would be parts that I just loved. So we shall see when I finish it awhile from now. 

I really liked M. Myriel, he was a very nice man. I mean just because he's a man of the cloth doesn't mean he will be nice but he was and I loved him. It was sad when he died. 

Jean Valjean was a prisoner of 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread to try to feed his sister and her seven children. They don't care if people or kids starve to death and going to jail for 19 years. Wow! Jean only heard of news one time of his sister and the youngest child working and going to school. No one knows what became of the rest of the children. 



After the 19 years Jean was let out on parole. He couldn't find a place to take him in for the night and feed him. He had money but they didn't want a criminal in their inns. But he came upon M. Myriel who was a Bishop at the church. (if I have it all correctly) He let Jean have a bed for the first time in years, gave him food and was very kind to him. In turn, Jean stole away in the night with the silverware. But being the kind man M. Myriel was he didn't press charges when the coppers dragged Jean back. He did tell something to Jean that made him change his ways. 
 

The bishop approached him and said, in a low voice. ""Do not forget, ever, that you have promised me to use this silver to become an honest man. 

Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of any such promise, stood dumbfounded. The bishop had stressed these words as he spoke them. He continued, solemnly, ""Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul I am buying from you. I withdraw it from dark thoughts and from the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God!""


Jean was a changed man after this and it was good. 

Next is the story of Fantine. This broke my heart! Fantine and some of her so called friends had suitors and they all thought they were going to be together and get married, all of the wonderful things. But it was not so. The men left the woman with nothing. Fantine was left with child and her so called friends all went separate ways. 

Fantine had to leave little Cosette at a home until she got enough money to get her. The home was a fake and they were rude and horrible people. Fantine sent them money to keep Cosette. Year after year she sent money. She worked for Jean who had a different name and owned a business. Sadly for Fantine she was fired because of some jerk workers and Jean never knew about it. 

Fantine was forced to sale her hair, some of her teeth and become a whore so Cosette would be okay. 



One day Fantine was taken to jail for scratching a jerk man. Jean found her there and took her to the hospital. He saved her from being put in prison, but unfortunately she had a disease and would not live. He made a promise to find Cosette. It was so very sad that she had to live the life she did and never see her daughter ever again. She was thrown away........

Jean found Cosette carrying a heavy water bucket and asked her many questions. He found out she was the girl she promised Fantine he would take care of, her daughter. 



Jean watched how the couple were treating Cosette because he was staying at their Inn. He as livid and so was I at the way Cosette was treated. Jean told them he was taking her away with him, paid them money (overcharged) for his stay there. Oh, and I loved when he went out and bought her a most expensive doll for her alone because only the owners two daughters got toys to play with, it was so bitter sweet. 

They stayed on the run for a time. Jean was always on the run on and off as he's always wanted. He can never shake that freaking, Javert. 

Jean and Cosette ending up staying with a man Jean had saved awhile back. Jean worked in the little garden. 

Jean, who had lost all thoughts of loving anything when he was in prison. He was a hard man with no love, no anything. But then he felt a spark that grew and grew for Cosette, his daughter, for that's what she became. So sweet. 


His whole heart melted in gratitude and he loved more and more. 
Several years went by like this. Cosette was growing up.




Unfortunately, I'm not liking this book as much as I would have hoped. I love the parts with Jean and Cosette and hope that there will be more and I will at least love it just enough.

Afterword
Selected Bibliography

The story continues on with Cosette growing up, finding Marius and love. A revolution. Javert still on Jean's trail. The marriage of Cosette and Marius. And the deaths of Javert and Jean. 

The book did bring some tears to my eyes. 

It was really sweet with Cosette and Marius. They were made for each other. Even though Jean wasn't too happy about it, he did save Marius in the end so he would live for Cosette. 



Javert finally gave up. Jean had saved him from death and Javert threatened once again to kill him, but alas it was his own life he took. He was just tired.....



Jean was on his deathbed when Cosette and Marius found him. He was so happy to see his daughter and Marius. Jean had an angel watching over him and he went peacefully. 



Jean, you were a most wonderful man! 




The night was starless and very dark. Without any doubt, in the gloom, some mighty angel was standing, with outstretched wings, waiting for the soul.


MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"
1089,Emily May,The Princess Bride,"Sep 13, 2013",5,"It's amazing that I've never found time to read this book before. I have seen the movie, but it was years ago and I only really remember the one thing that everyone remembers:



The real strength of this book is that is just ticks every box imaginable. It's a fairy tale, full of action, romance and revenge, and it has that timeless quality that the best fairy tales seem to carry. It was published in the 1970s but it feels like it should be a thousand years old, passed down from generation to generation. It's non-stop adventure, comedy gold and full of some of the most memorable characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading about.

Goldman's writing style for this novel works so surprisingly well. For one, it's such an unusual idea to write a retelling of a story by a fictional author - Goldman claims his father read him the S. Morgenstern classic as a child and then proceeds to tell us the ""abridged"" version with all the good parts. It's strange how well his constant sidenotes actually add to the story, rather than take us out of it. I think maybe it's the little kids inside most readers who remember the magic of being read a story as a child. Because while this is a fantasy story with magic and princesses, it's also a bittersweet tale about how a father introduced his son to the world of stories.

And I found it hilarious. I want you to know how rare it is for me to find a book that successfully combines silly humour with dramatic action and adventure. I've struggled with authors like Terry Pratchett because I felt the humour took away any serious investment I may have had in the story. But this book quietly mocks itself on every page and it works so well. At first I wondered if I would be rolling my eyes at the whole notion of Buttercup as ""the most beautiful woman in the world"", but Goldman rolls his eyes for us with the comic portrayal of obsession with beauty and true love. 

The characters here are so rich and vivid that it's hard to imagine that they don't exist somewhere in an alternate fantasy world. Everyone remembers and loves Inigo Montoya and the pretty-faced Westley, but I was surprised by Buttercup. My memory of the movie seems to have done her a disservice because I remembered her as a typical, beautiful princess. But no, Buttercup is fierce and brave. She might be silly and naive at the start but she grows and develops with age. She doesn't sit back and let things happen to her, which I like.

Honestly, this was a delight to read. I can't believe I waited so long.

1091,Michael Finocchiaro,The Giving Tree,"Jul 18, 2016",5,"Shel Silverstein is truly one of the greatest American poets for kids. The Giving Tree is a wonderful story about friendship and ageing. No spoilers, but don't let your kids miss out on this absolutely gorgeous story!"
1092,Stephen,Twilight ,"Apr 17, 2011",1,"Welcome to Part II of the Vampire Compatibility Test (VCT). Before we continue, let's briefly racap Part I of the VCT. Your score in Part I should have given you a good idea of how critically you judge vampire fiction, placing you in either ""Group A"" or ""Group B"" based on overall points scored. 

Group A: 

A fairly harsh to extremely harsh critic that requires in a vampire story that it be: (a) well written or at least highly engaging prose; (b) tightly plotted with a well defined backstory that is either tied to an established ‚Äúvampire mythos‚Äù or adds something substantial to the vampire genre; and (c) an intelligent, compelling original story or a slick, fast-paced, chill-filled thrill ride. 

Group B: 

Includes those that are not too critical and are generally okay as long as the writing and plot are not horrible and there is ‚Äúsomething about it‚Äù that makes it an interesting diversion. This group also includes those that are not sure what the word critic means. 

So with Part I completed, we now turn to Part II of the VCT test. In this section, we will take a look at the most popular vampire series in publishing history (i.e., the Twilight series) and help you determine whether it is a good choice for your next reading selection**. 

**(PLEASE NOTE: If you are part of ""Group A"" above than the answer is clearly NO, and you can move on immediately to Part III of the VCT.) 

For those in Group B, here are the instructions for this section of the VCT. For each of the 4 questions below, select the answer that best describes your personal taste when it comes to vampire fiction. Each answer has a corresponding point value that will be added up at the end of the test. The total number of points will indicate a preference for a certain kind of vampire novel, which can then be used to assist you in selecting the right story for you. 
¬†
QUESTION 1: Which of the following best describes your favorite kind of vampire?
¬†
A: Sparkly, epically EMO and unable to look threatening without legal counsel and a tactical nuke; 0 points
¬†
B: Underwear model hotness with perfect hair who smells like the beach and has eyes that can cause a person‚Äôs naughty bits to spontaneously combust. 5 points
¬†
C: Chalky skin, ‚Äúsuper cuts‚Äù hair, stylistically challenged clothing (with or without Liberace cape) with long nails, ivory fangs and a kick ass accent. 10 points ¬†¬†
¬†

¬†0 points
¬†
B. Yes, I think it would be pretty cool.¬† 5 points
¬†

¬†
D. No way, I would rather die than become one of those things. 15 points
¬†
E. ARE YOU FUCKING PSYCHO? Not only would I rather die but I would personally hogtie my best friends and leave them for the creatures to munch on while I made good my escape. 20 points
¬†
QUESTION 3: Which of the following best describes how you would respond if a casual acquaintance asked you if they should check out the popular ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù series by Stephenie Meyer?
¬†
A. I would say YES because it is the best book since Crime and Punishment, no wait, the BEST BOOK EVER and everyone should read it. 0 points
¬†
B. I would say YES, but would spend the next 20 minutes qualifying my answer using phrases like: ‚Äúwell, some people find it kinda cheesy‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs not exactly quality prose‚Äù and ‚Äúyou should know that I‚Äôm pretty forgiving of the plot because I just LOVE the characters‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fucking look at me like that. I mean, it sold like a gagillion copies so it can‚Äôt be all bad.‚Äù 5 points
¬†
C. Even though I really like it, I would be too embarrassed to admit that I read it and would tell the person NO and that they should to read Ulysses instead because ‚Äúit is like way deep and shit.‚Äù 10 points
 
D. I would say NO and tell them to go read Dracula because it‚Äôs an excellent Vampire story!! 15 points
¬†

QUESTION 4:¬†If they made a major hollywood movie of your favorite vampire movie, what rating would the MPAA give it?

A. PG to PG-13 for EMO Adult situations, snarky Adult language and boring violence. 0 points

B. PG-13 for strong sexual situations, strong sexual situations and strong to very strong sexual situations. 5 points

C. R for Adult language, sweet, bloody violence, fright and nudity followed by bimbo deaths. 10 points

D. NC-17 to banned in the U.S. for almost continuous gore on a massive scale, vampires more disgusting than a SUMO wrestler's bowel movement and.......lots and lots of nudity because WHY NOT. 15 points

SCORING FOR PART II OF VCT:

0 to 10 points. Ignore the 1 star rating above, buy ""first printings"" of all four of the Twilight books and read them over and over until your eyes bleed. 

15 to 20 points. Twilight is probably a 2 star read and you might think about squeezing it in between episodes of ‚ÄúJersey Shore.‚Äù

25 to 50 points. Best to skip Twilight as it is not likely to be a memorable read for you. 

50 points or over. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Twilight is your vampire kryptonite and reading it will make you think less of yourself and may cause severe and long lasting anger and/or depression at the current state of the world. 

 REVIEW NOTES AND COMMENTS:

* An apology for this review to my wife who loves these books.

1093,Chelsea Humphrey,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ,"Oct 03, 2018",4,"Guys, this was so much better than the movie. I know it's not fair to compare, but because the film version of Order of the Phoenix isn't one of my favorites, coupled with the fact that this is the longest novel in the series, I was really nervous to get to this one. Obviously I was a muggle fool who deserves to be chased around by Peeves for a full 24 hours, because this was such a vital installment that really breathed a mature life into the series. The ending of Goblet of Fire is quite dark, but I felt book #5 is where the series really gets down to business and loses the childlike innocence that it clasped tightly for some long. What a brilliant, hauntingly beautiful way to write a series that grows as the reader does. Only two more to go, which makes me quite sad, but also excited to find out how they compare to the rest!"
1094,Samadrita,The Lightning Thief ,"Nov 15, 2012",1,"EDIT 09/06/2013:-
 That's it. I have had my fill of too many stupid, brain-cell destroying comments posted on this review in the past few months asking me to write a 'best-selling book' before attempting to take apart Rick Riordan's writing. As if the exclusive privilege of negatively criticizing a book is accorded only to published writers and not ordinary reviewers/readers. 
I do have the right to record my feelings about a book in my review. And it's such a shame that I am actually being forced to put up this edit to make people aware of this fact. If this review hurts your sentiments as a fan, I am sorry I can't help you there. You must grow up and learn to let dichotomous opinions co-exist in harmony on the same page. That is all. 

Caution:- Brutal honesty ahead. Read at the expense of having to respect someone else's views.

---------

What a feeble attempt at recreating the Harry Potter magic! Aside from being highly unoriginal and unimaginative, the book grates on your nerves due to the frequency of Percy's lame attempts at sounding witty. Seriously, I'm supposed to laugh at his observations on the 'Bull Man' and 'barnyard animals'? 
Not only did the writer not bother racking his brains to come up with a plot or a proper story, choosing instead to recycle key elements of the Harry Potter series, but he also ignored important aspects of a fantasy novel, one of which is the language. To call the narration just bad will be an understatement. Same can be said about the dialogue and the way the plot progresses - it's one cliched event unfolding after another. 
The only novel thing about this book is the seamless integration of Greek mythology into a fantasy-based set-up. The 1 star is for that. 
And so I'd like to put a premature end to my review because I just realized the futility of writing one of a book I hated."
1095,Josh Hyung (Ï°∞ÏäàÏïÑ),The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Apr 03, 2016",5,"The 2005 film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was what made me want to read this thick, heavenly book. Little yet valiant Lucy was very close to my heart, as well as her siblings who occasionally thought she was crazy. I was so enthralled by the movie, and I asked my parents if they could buy me the series for my birthday.

My uncle in the US was the one who granted my wish. Tee-hee. After buying this collection from Barnes & Noble, he immediately had it shipped all the way to the Philippines. Hence, this book literally traveled to my hands. I was overwhelmed with happiness when it finally arrived. After all, it was the first series I had ever owned. After caressing it for a long time, I tucked myself into bed and got down to business.

Little did I know that this would be the series that would transform me into a devoted booknerd. At the age of 12, I managed to fly through each novel because they were just so beautiful and fantastic. The perfect mix of magic, adventure, and biblical allusions captivated me from start to finish. By the time I read The Last Battle, I was already a hardcore fanboy.

In totality, The Chronicles of Narnia will always have a special place in my heart (and library). Just looking at Aslan's face on the cover fills me with much happiness and nostalgia. If I were the Ruler of Books, I would require everyone in the planet to read this timeless series."
1096,Yun,Brave New World,"Aug 20, 2017",3,"I first read Brave New World many years (decades) ago in high school, and I remember thinking it was really interesting at the time. Well, I must have been a doofus back then because this reread just didn't live up to expectations. To be honest, my impression now is that it's all a bit of a mess.

First, who exactly are the main characters here? We start following a few people, but end up focusing on someone else entirely. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic, not even the supposedly enlightened ""savage"" man from outside this world. And this savage man, even though he had a bit of homeschooling in the middle of nowhere, can converse on a superior level with the Controller of Western Europe upon meeting him. (Cue eye-rolling.)

The story relies heavily on Shakespeare quotes to make its point, often devolving into random ramblings for pages at a time. In a whole chapter devoted to discussions on religion, it clearly implies that turning one's back on religion causes a society to melt down into dystopia. (More eye-rolling.)

And on top of that, the part that annoys me the most is its treatment of the female main character. The ""savage"" calls her a whore every time he feels attracted to her and goes so far as to physically attack her, since it's obviously her fault for tempting him. I know this was written in the 1930s, so maybe this sort of rape-culture thinking was the norm back then, but it doesn't make reading it now any less offensive.

I'll be generous and give it 3 stars for being a classic with some interesting ideas about dystopian society. But if I were to rank it against books out there today, it's not worth more than 2 stars. Womp womp."
1097,Jo (The Book Geek),The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Boxed Set: The Fellowship / The Two Towers / The Return of the King,"Apr 24, 2022",5,"As this is my fourth or fifth read through of this book, I feel like I don't need to repeat myself and construct a long-winded review on how this is quite easily, my favourite set of books. Instead, I'm going to write a few words on how I feel right at this moment. 

Coming to the end of LOTR feels like coming home to a comfortable chair, a warm mug of fine coffee, and a large slab of carrot cake with extra cream cheese frosting. It's rather like an old friend, and I'm positive it is one I will revisit, again and again throughout my life. 

This particular time, I felt a deeper connection to the story and the characters, and I was totally immersed in every single chapter. It was difficult to tear myself away, even for a moment. 

Gandalf and √âowyn will always have that special space in my heart. Her character often reminds me of myself, in many ways. (I also would have totally delivered that killing blow to The witch king). 

Probably one of my favourite excerpts, that has stood the test of time;

""Arise, arise, riders of Rohan!
Fell deeds awake, fire and slaughter!
Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered!
A sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!
Ride now, ride now, ride to Gondor!""

In the final chapter or so, I'm not ashamed to admit that I found it difficult to hold back those bittersweet tears. What a wonderful world Mr John Ronald Reuel Tolkien created for us all to love and enjoy! I am so grateful that my wonderful Dad introduced me to Middle Earth at such a young age. Thank you Dad, you did well."
1098,Meghhnaa  (On a Review-Writing Break!),Animal Farm,"Sep 08, 2022",5,"‚ÄúAnimal Farm‚Äù is a hilarious polemic, anthropomorphic, allegorical novel on the 1917 Russian revolution, but is very much perpetually applicable to the past, current and future political state-of-affairs! It is emblematic of rebellion against dictators and totalitarianism!

It is a story of the Farmer Jones‚Äô animals rising up in rebellion, tired of exploitation, to take over the ‚ÄúManor Farm‚Äù, to build a fairer society for themselves. There are stark similarities between politicians and animal leaders. Power and use of language for controlling minds, has been astutely demonstrated in this novel, by George Orwell. Being a short-fabled fairy-like animal entertainer, it doesn‚Äôt render itself into a boring political study for a tad! 

A satirical comedy on the inextricability of power and corruption, and their insidious effect on the common public! The corruption of the pigs metaphorically demonstrates the yielding of the politicians (in any age or era) for gaining power and control. The skilful use of peer pressure by pigs to keep the rest of the animals subservient, is analogous to modern-day plight of students and corporate employees!

The story begins with the 12-yr old Major(boar), revealing his dream to his comrades(other animals at farm), about the future rebellion of animals against men, and teaching all a song-‚ÄúBeasts Of England‚Äù. 
He clarifies to all ‚Äì ""All men are enemies. All animals are comrades.""
Soon Major dies, Snowball and Napoleon, take the lead! One fine evening, the animals drive away Mr. Jones (farm owner), and rename the farm ‚Äì ‚ÄúAnimal Farm‚Äù.

The 7 commandments are inscribed, on the tarred wall with great white letters-

1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. 
2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. 
3. No animal shall wear clothes.
4. No animal shall sleep in a bed. 
5. No animal shall drink alcohol. 
6. No animal shall kill any other animal. 
7. All animals are equal.

Since most of the animals cannot learn to read or to memorize the seven commandments, the commandments are reduced to one simple maxim: ‚ÄúFour legs good, two legs bad.‚Äù

Mr. Jones tries to recapture the farm, but Snowball successfully defends it. Mollie, the horse, who is seen consorting with the humans, is confronted, and finally leaves the rebellion and the Farm!

The humans despise the burgeoning of the Animal Farm!

But things don‚Äôt remain hunky-dory, and we see the rebellion being betrayed, the farm getting dilapidated again, all under the dictatorship of one of their leaders! (avoiding spoilers)

Animal Farm is a fun ride, as it teaches the intertwinement and inextricability of power and corruption in the most amusingly creative way, which remains applicable to current age and aeons to come!

A fun-filled 5 stars!!"
1099,Baba,The Great Gatsby,"Apr 21, 2022",4,"If you don't succeed at first, try, try again! On rereading this book 'Fitzgerald's crowning achievement - THE novel of the 1920s, and loved by every generation since' it's like my eyes have been opened and a shroud lifted! From the very first page the writing, the atmosphere and that reliable(!) narrator held my attention and kept it rivetted over all nine short chapters. As well as being a blistering critique of the American Dream, it's also about the narrator Nick Carraway's eye's being opened, just like mine were on truly understanding the story of the great Gatsby!

Personally feel that this story will always stand true for America, the way people are so easily thrown under the bus when their tide turns, despite being so 'invested in' and 'hung on to' when in vogue, see Gatsby; how the privileged live their lives and decimate the lives of the less privileged around them with little regard or indeed consequence, i.e. Tom and Daisy; how striving for the American Dream has no real rules and does not really call for a moral compass or integrity, see Gatsby; and how the enlightened, despite understanding this, do little about it, as the American Dream is a integral part of America itself, see Nick. The cherry on top is the writing and the utterly amazing feat of saying so much in so few pages. F. Scott Fitzgerald, I so stand corrected! 9 out of 12!

This book also underlines one of my strongest bookish beliefs, in that if I ever ""don't get"" a lauded read, I must one day return at another point in my life and reread it again, especially as my expectations are very much then lowered. If you didn't/don't think much of this book, please read it again one day. This book kicks ass!

1100,Orsodimondo,Il Piccolo Principe,"Jul 09, 2012",4,"L‚ÄôIMMAGINAZIONE AL POTERE

Ma i grandi non capiranno mai che questo abbia tanta importanza.


Illustrazione originale di Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry."
1101,Fabian,Les Mis√©rables,"Feb 16, 2015",4,"I chose to read the hefty Victor Hugo classic for my thirtieth birthday, &, let me tell you, the experience was One Biiiig Bitch. I mean, why EVEN go to the 200 + year old text when the Broadway musical exists! THAT work of art exudes all beauty and majesty in one continuous song that unites the characters through time; ultimately giving us a true theme, or feeling of genuine victory over adversity. The plot, one gorgeous telenovela of a story, replete with jailbreaks, insurrections, betrayals, war, calamities multiplied & order restored is, in short, too much Muchness for one reader to possibly occupy himself with.
 
This is the longest novel I have ever read (probably Don Quixote, which took me an entire month to read, is the closest second). & as such, it is difficult--a staggering activity indeed--to maintain order in its review, much less in the colossus text itself that's just very disordered, odd, beautiful-but-not-always; it is a mixture (an irritating one at that, & less than a boost toward modernism) of myriad tones & paces, a gargantuan monster from the abysmal depths of time: a list of lists, basically; a lexicon in Everything French Revolution.

What is the purpose of so many compilation of details to make a heap of facts that, quite frankly, fail to make either a juicy romance or gory history. It's infuriating because it takes up so much of your time. And, bottom line, the characters, even Jean Valjean the lament-filled hero who feels guilt palpably like the feel of the guillotine, is a beacon that illuminates but also dis-illusions. (...and Cosette is a ninny, and Fantine gets duped awful by a group of boys and girls, & Javert is a true mystery that ends up having less to do with our story than other less famous villains like M. Thenardier...)

It is basic Law to read this, so I did. It has not aged well, dudes, fur reels. Like some expensive wine that got rancid. A French one.

&, just because I am very generous, these here are the top four best parts (AKA the most heartwarming) in all of Les Mis., if you wanted to know, followed by the four worst:

1) How Valjean gets Cosette from the clutches of the Thenardiers (the dude simply won't let go!)
2) Gavroche's taking-in of the two Thenardier ""brats""
3) Marius' self-inflicted poverty
4) the Bishop's story

The worst are these girthy diatribes that provoke (gasp!) some paragraph skippage:
1) on the Sewers
2) on the slang
3) on the Streets of Paris
4) on the barriacades, which reminds the reader that so many French pre-Revolutionary factoids withholds reader's pleasure, somewhat barricading the avid reader's truest delight."
1102,Emily (Books with Emily Fox),Of Mice and Men,"Nov 08, 2022",3,"Can't believe some teachers make teenagers read this in school.

Don't get me wrong, this was good but it's so... miserable. Everyone's live is so awful.
I need to continue reading more by the author!

Edit: I know the misery is the point. Doesn't mean I enjoyed reading it. It was fine just not a favorite."
1103,Chelsea Humphrey,City of Bones ,"Jun 23, 2017",4,"I can totally see why everyone rants and raves over these books; while I'm only one deep (so far) and hoping to read City of Ashes in the very near future, I feel this is the type of book that teenage Chelsea would have flipped her turds for back in the day. I'm just glad I can still enjoy them now.  While very teen oriented, City of Bones still had a classic feel that surpassed barriers of age and gender, and I have heard from many folks that they wish they had found these books while they were still a young, gay teen, as this book was before it's time in it's courageous attempt to feature a homosexual couple before it was popular to do so. I was completely sucked into the action, drama, and mysterious intrigue that sweeps over the reader from the first page; I couldn't tell if I should be embarrassed to be so obsessed with such a cliche, teenage read, but honestly I don't care. I AM HERE FOR ALL THE TMI LOVE AND AM PROUD OF IT.

I unfortunately accidentally stumbled across the movie before picking up these books, so there are a few spoilers I already knew about before starting the books since the movie pulled a bit from the first 2-3 books? I think? I actually like going into beloved, hyped up series knowing some of the big things before reading them for myself; I found I can enjoy it more if the stress of knowing who to ship is already handled for me so I don't invest in the wrong coupling (view spoiler)[(I'm looking at you Chaol and Celaena) (hide spoiler)]. Obviously this series features all types of supernatural creatures, but I like how Clare gave a feel of placing multiple religious/mythical/world views into a giant mashup that became her own. It was very clever and ballsy and I love it. 

There's not really much I can say here that hasn't already been said thousands of times over the past decade, but I'm so glad I've officially experienced my first Cassandra Clare novel and I can't wait to continue on. I know there's some dissension among which order to read in, but I've decided on reading them: 1-3 TMI, 1-3 TID, 4-6 TMI, then follow with TDA series. Wish me luck; I have a lot of catching up to do! ;) Side note- I somehow scored a like new used set of all the books (except TDA) and they all are these gorgeous Australian paperbacks. That is all."
1104,Brina,Gone With the Wind,"Jul 04, 2016",5,"One of my reading themes for 2016 is reading at least ten classic books. It seems only fitting that on the Fourth of July I completed Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind, an epic masterpiece that many view as the definitive great American novel. 

I feel that the two halves of the book mirror the southern United States before and after the Civil War. The first half of the book occurs primarily at Tara Plantation. We meet our main protagonist Scarlett O'Hara, the belle of the south, who epitomizes what life was like in the antebellum era: young, carefree, never having to lift a finger and having an entire plantation at her beck and call. She never gave a thought to slavery, the confederate cause, or political matters because in the south that she knew, this was her way of life. 

Next, there is the fated barbecue at neighboring Twelve Oaks plantation. We meet mainstays Ashley and Melanie Wilkes who are to be married. Scarlett grew up with Ashley and desires him yet this is a teenage fantasy, unfortunately one that will plague her for the rest of her life. Witnessing her declaration of love for Ashley is the mysterious Rhett Butler, an unreceived gentleman with a past. Instantly smitten with Scarlett's looks and personality, he begins a lifelong quest to have her as his own. And then the Great War hits and shatters all these dreams. 

Scarlett reduced to nothing rebuilds. She is a modern woman who goes into business despite an entire city of Atlanta giving her nasty looks. She does this at the cost of her children's upbringing so she can rebuild Tara and her Atlanta life from the rubble of the war. Although many people in their reviews state that they dislike Scarlett and her selfish motives, I view her character with determination as she tried to better her place in society in order to leave her children with more than she started with. Mitchell is writing from a 20th century perspective and had witnessed the modern woman and inserts some of these modern traits into Scarlett. Combine that with her Irish blood, and we have one of the most determined protagonists of all time. 

Of course as in any epic, we have a sketch of the time period. I learned much about the reconstruction south because growing up in the north, we only had what was in the history books. I knew the basics but not the intimate look at how southerners rebuilt following the war. There were two views to the new south- there was Ashley Wilkes who pined for Twelve Oaks and the way of life before the war and Rhett Butler who symbolizes the modern south and how Atlanta and the south rose again. The second half of the book focuses on these two men and how they coped and succeeded in reconstruction, yet it all came back to Scarlett and which of the two paths she would choose, which man's dreams she would decide to follow. 

Behind Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley and their dreams, we have Melanie Wilkes. She was the only character who knew all the principal players for who they were, and held them together through good times and bad. Whereas Scarlett was the new south, the new woman, Melanie was the south and the picture of the south I have always had- a strong woman, rallying soldiers, rallying for every cause after reconstruction, holding together an entire city, selfless. Even Scarlett with all her selfishness turned to Melanie in times of greatest need, even though Melanie is the one who viewed Scarlett as the pillar of strength. And yet, both women were strength, Melanie in her antiquated ways and Scarlett as the new woman who would bring this country forward while still remembering Tara, where she came from. 

As I finish this epic on America's birthday I feel a sadness as I leave behind Mitchell's well drawn characters that earned her a Pulitzer Prize 80 years ago. Scarlett's determination, Rhett's swarthy brashness, Ashley's love of time gone by, Melanie's heart. I look forward to seeing the epic film for the first time and witnessing Scarlett and Rhett and Tara on screen. I am glad I let myself be drawn into this slice of Americana from bygone eras, and believe that every American should attempt to read Mitchell's masterpiece at least once in their lives."
1105,Stephen,1984,"Aug 28, 2008",5,"I am a big fan of speculative fiction and in my literary travels I have encountered a myriad of dystopias, anti-utopias and places and societies that make one want to scream and.....

 
...(with or without contemporaneous loss of bladder and other bodily functions)....

Simply put, George Orwell's 1984 is unquestionably the most memorable and MOST DISTURBING vision of a world gone mad utterly bat-shit psycho that I have ever experienced. Ever!!! Despite being published back in 1948, I have yet to find a more chilling, nightmarish locale than Orwell's iconic world of BIG BROTHER and INGSOC. The very mention of either of those terms invokes images of Nazis and Soviet gulags in my mind. Yet Orwell's creation is in many ways even more insidious than these real-world bogeymen.

I first read this book when I was 12 years old in 7th grade as a...get this...class reading assignment. Looking back on it, I have NO IDEA why on Earth we were reading this book at that age but I do recall we spent quite a bit of time discussing it. I wish I could recall the substance of those discussions because I can only imagine the kind of PIERCING INSIGHT that a group of hormonally challenged pre-teens thought up in regards to this book. Needless to say, I think that this is a book that is best appreciated AFTER your first pimple. 

Anyway, I decided to re-read this book recently as an adult in the hopes that I would be able to gain a great appreciation for this classic. Well, the book did more than that. IT ABSOLUTELY FLOORED ME. From the very first sentence, ""It was a bright, cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen"" to the unforgettable final sentence (which I will not give away here), this story sucked me in, beat the living shit out of me and through me out the other side a hollow, wasted wreck. I know, it doesn't sound very cheery, but it is a life-changing experience. 

I have always thought that one of the best and most important qualities of science fiction is that it frees the author to take the controversial, politically charged issues and trends of the day and create a possible future based on exaggerations of such trends and in so doing present a compelling and critical argument for change. Well NO ONE has ever done a better job than better Orwell in showing the possible nightmare (and thus potential danger) of a society without basic civil liberties and a government with complete and unchallenged control. 

This book is bleak, dreary, frightening, upsetting and absolutely BRILLIANT and one of my ""All Time Favorite"" novels. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! 6.0 stars. 

...........REMEMBER, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU............."
1106,Navessa,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ,"Mar 13, 2013",5,"Seriously, don't read this review if you haven't read the books. 

The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer. 

This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry‚Äôs story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. 

And then BAM!

The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he‚Äôs in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there‚Äôs only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. 

Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy‚Äôs wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. 

So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt tell you anything about what we‚Äôve been doing, and we‚Äôve been doing A LOT. But don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll see you soon, we just can‚Äôt tell you when‚Äù? As if he hasn‚Äôt been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what‚Äôs going on, it‚Äôs Harry. Doesn‚Äôt anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what‚Äôs best for him better than he does? 

And that‚Äôs part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children‚Äôs stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child‚Äôs mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren‚Äôt the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn‚Äôt infallible. James Potter isn‚Äôt infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn‚Äôt infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. 

Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! 

The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that‚Äôs one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George‚Äôs badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry‚Äôs interference. 

I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn‚Äôt sunshine and roses and you don‚Äôt always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don‚Äôt get the sense that Sirius‚Äôs death was a righteous one. You don‚Äôt get resolution. He didn‚Äôt make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. 

So while I don‚Äôt necessarily ""enjoy"" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.

1107,Steven Medina,Los miserables,"Mar 09, 2020",5,"Simplemente maravilloso. 

He tardado m√°s de tres meses en realizar esta rese√±a. Desde que finalic√© la lectura en marzo, estoy escribiendo distintos borradores para intentar expresar todo lo que sent√≠ leyendo esta obra maestra. El problema, es que en mi cabeza tengo tantos pensamientos y reflexiones relacionados a este libro, que contarlos todos se ha convertido en un trabajo muy complicado. Les confieso, que la frustraci√≥n por no estar satisfecho por lo que estaba escribiendo, casi me lleva a cancelar la realizaci√≥n de esta rese√±a. Sin embargo, lo he logrado y por ello la siguiente rese√±a es el resultado de mi sexto intento.

Mi relaci√≥n con Los Miserables inici√≥ mal. En el a√±o 2019 fue el culpable de un bloqueo lector que tuve por varios meses. En ese tiempo, cre√≠ que estaba preparado para leer esta historia y con mucha confianza lo intent√©, pero 150 p√°ginas despu√©s, aunque me estaba gustando no pude soportar el estilo de narraci√≥n de Victor Hugo, donde sus descripciones fueron muy extensas. Fue agotador, complicado y me desconcentraba muy seguido con algunos cap√≠tulos que parec√≠an eternos. Estaba acostumbrado a leer historias sencillas, por lo que mi primer contacto con Los Miserables me dejo muy frustrado, sin confianza, con miedo a leer un texto extenso y con una renuncia como evidencia absoluta de mi derrota. 

Con el transcurso de los meses, recuper√© mi confianza y disciplina, al leer ejemplares como Apocalipsis de Stephen King o la saga completa de Harry Potter. Fue un tiempo tranquilo y sin turbulencias. Sin embargo, cuando el fin de a√±o se acerc√≥, misteriosamente el t√≠tulo de este libro me persegu√≠a por todas partes: En Youtube, Facebook, y aqu√≠ mismo en Goodreads, todos los d√≠as ve√≠a algo que me recordaba esa deuda pendiente que ten√≠a con este libro. Entonces impulsado por las promesas decembrinas, respir√© profundo y me promet√≠ a m√≠ mismo que sin importar lo que ocurriera, ten√≠a que enfrentar el miedo a leer Los Miserables.

En enero comenc√© mi reto. Ley√©ndolo solo los fines de semana, tomando apuntes, investigando los contextos hist√≥ricos que se presentaban y teniendo mucha paciencia, arranque esta aventura que me llev√≥ tres meses finalizar. ¬øSufr√≠? Claro que s√≠. Nuevamente, en algunos tramos sent√≠ lo mismo que en mi primer intento, con la diferencia de que no leerlo diariamente me permit√≠a recobrar la energ√≠a necesaria para enfrentar las siguientes p√°ginas. A este paso, lento pero seguro, logr√© comprender la forma como funcionaba este libro.

El funcionamiento consiste en que primero Victor Hugo nos relata con excesivos detalles el entorno. Pueden ser entre diez y setenta p√°ginas, donde aparecer√° infinidad de informaci√≥n relacionada a esa √©poca. Desde nombres de nobles, costumbres, fechas festivas o sucesos del d√≠a a d√≠a, hasta explicarnos la historia de las alcantarillas, de un convento, de la batalla de Waterloo o la estructura de un barco. La mayor parte de esos detalles no hay necesidad de memorizarlos, porque cuando finalizamos esos cap√≠tulos, comprendemos que esos fragmentos est√°n hechos para reforzar el contexto en el que se desarrollar√° la siguiente parte del libro y no para torturarnos. Sin embargo, no se los niego, en esas secciones se sufre mucho, pero vale la pena resistir ese calvario porque despu√©s los acontecimientos que ocurren son espectaculares. Una vez nos adaptamos a ese estilo de libro que es poco com√∫n en la actualidad, se ir√° de nuestros pensamientos la idea de renunciar. 

Como he sufrido tanto con este libro, quiero ofrecer algunos consejos a aquellos lectores que a√∫n no han le√≠do esta obra o que han desistido en el intento, para que se animen a intentar conocer uno de los mejores libros de la literatura universal. Esos consejos son:

- No lo lean diariamente: Este libro no est√° hecho para acabarlo en un corto periodo de tiempo, por lo que intentarlo, provocar√° que se saturen de informaci√≥n y se cansaran inevitablemente. Es mejor leer Los Miserables altern√°ndolo con otras obras m√°s ligeras.

- Paciencia: Si creen que no la tienen es mejor que no lo lean, porque la necesitar√°n.

- Anotaciones: Es recomendable realizar anotaciones con nombres de los personajes u otros detalles, porque hay ocasiones donde se hace referencia a personajes que no nos acordaremos de 300 o 400 p√°ginas le√≠das anteriormente. 

- Investiguen sobre la historia de Francia: Victor Hugo da por hecho que conocemos los eventos hist√≥ricos que nombra, por lo que quedaremos algo confundidos si desconocemos la historia de la Insurrecci√≥n, de la monarqu√≠a, de la Batalla de Waterloo, entre otros. Si conocemos la historia previamente, esas p√°ginas nos ayudar√°n a reflexionar sobre esos eventos ocurridos; en caso contrario, nos perderemos de esos mensajes de ense√±anza. 

- L√©anlo a su propio ritmo: No importa si tardan tres meses, seis meses o un a√±o. No se apresuren y usen el tiempo necesario. Cuando les falte poco para finalizarlo ya no querr√°n terminarlo, yo s√© porque se los digo.

- Experiencia: Si no han le√≠do nunca un libro extenso que se acerque o supere las mil p√°ginas, no lo lean todav√≠a. Primero ganen experiencia con otras obras y luego s√≠ int√©ntenlo, de lo contrario no lo soportaran. 

- Adaptaci√≥n: Si lo que buscan es una obra que tenga un ritmo vertiginoso, este libro no es para ustedes. Los Miserables se desarrolla lentamente, por lo que si quieren realmente leer este libro, tendr√°n que adaptarse al ritmo que nos ofrece el autor.

Como pueden notar el reto no es sencillo, pero si lo enfrentas y superas las dificultades, encontrar√°s un libro del que te enamorar√°s por toda la vida. Leer Los Miserables ha sido una experiencia maravillosa. Nunca imagin√© que un libro llegar√° a cautivarme tanto como ha ocurrido en esta ocasi√≥n, y eso se debe a que Victor Hugo tiene una habilidad impresionante para transmitir sentimientos profundos a sus lectores. En la mayor parte del libro, sent√≠ como si √©l jugar√° con mis sentimientos. Es un hechizo extra√±o que sentimos con sus palabras. Me hizo llorar, como cuando nos desahogamos; me hizo sentir amor, como al estar enamorados; me hizo sentir ira, como al ver una injusticia; me hizo sentir tristeza, como al ver el estado miserable en el que se encuentra un ser; me hizo sentir impotencia, al no poder ayudar a esos personajes que estaban sufriendo tanto. Me hizo sentir de todo. 

Pero, ¬øpor qu√© este libro nos produce tantos sentimientos? Eso se debe a la espectacular narraci√≥n que Victor Hugo usa para hablar de temas como la pobreza, el matrimonio, la muerte, las rebeliones, las injusticias, las decisiones, la conciencia, los ladrones, el cambio de la maldad a la bondad, el amor, el sacrificio, etc. Usa una prosa tan dulce que en cualquier momento del libro, ya sea con una reflexi√≥n, por alguna frase o por una escena que sucede, nos deja sorprendidos, conmovidos y un estado de sensibilidad impresionante. Leer este libro no hace sino provocar agitamiento en nuestro coraz√≥n, as√≠ como inter√©s en temas inesperados, como la etimolog√≠a de las palabras o conocer sobre Napole√≥n. 

Fue un viaje tan largo, pero tan enriquecedor que no lo cambiar√≠a por nada. Siento tanta gratitud hacia Victor Hugo por crear este libro, que lo √∫nico que siento que puedo hacer para honrar su nombre, es incentivar a los dem√°s a que lean por lo menos una vez en su vida esta obra literaria. Es imposible que sus corazones no se conmocionen ante escenas y palabras tan conmovedoras como las que nos presenta Victor Hugo. No se arrepentir√°n nunca de leerlo. 

Tantos sentimientos y profundas reflexiones, Victor Hugo no las hace sentir contando la vida de Jean Valjean. √âl es condenado a cinco a√±os por robarse un pan para sus sobrinos que ten√≠an hambre. Sin embargo, esa condena resultar√° siendo de diecinueve a√±os por intentos de fuga. El problema, surge cuando al terminar su condena se encuentra una sociedad que lo rechaza por ser un preso, hasta el punto de no venderle comida o darle posada, a pesar de poseer dinero. Despu√©s, el obispo Myriel, mejor llamado monse√±or Bienvenu, le cambiar√° la vida transformando todo ese odio que siente por amor; lo que provocar√°, que Jean recorra un viaje cruel pero hermoso en el que se cruzar√° con diferentes personajes que tambi√©n tienen historias llenas de sufrimiento pero muy bien desarrolladas, tanto as√≠ que pueden ser de una persona real. Esos personajes ser√°n importantes no solo en el desarrollo de la trama, sino para ense√±arnos mucho sobre la vida. Los personajes se sienten tan reales que te acostumbras a ellos y a medida que avanzas quieres conocer m√°s de ellos, quieres que sean felices, quieres que no vuelvan a sufrir m√°s y quieres que quienes los persiguen o los odian, los dejen en paz y se alejen para siempre de ellos. Los personajes son perfectamente desarrollados. Entre esos personajes encontramos a Javert, Fantine, Cosette, Marius, Gavroche, los Th√©nardier, etc. Cada personaje es presentado en profundidad y algunos ser√° imposible olvidarlos por el resto de nuestras vidas.

Quisiera contarles muchas de esas escenas que cautivan a cualquier lector, pero leer esas escenas personalmente, es el premio de nuestra paciencia y de nuestro esfuerzo por leer este gigantesco libro. Atr√©vete, int√©ntalo y descubre las maravillas que te podr√° ofrecer esta obra literaria. La √∫nica advertencia que dir√© es que el final te parte el alma y te deja varias semanas consternado; no dir√© m√°s, el resto es mejor que lo descubra cada uno. 

Me encant√≥, me fascino, no s√© si lo volver√≠a a leer por su extensi√≥n, pero no cambiar√≠a ni un minuto de tiempo que he usado para leer este libro. Ha valido la pena cada segundo y me siento muy orgulloso por este gran logro que es terminar Los Miserables. Adicionalmente, declaro que personalmente el resultado de leer Los Miserables, ha sido perder el miedo a leer cualquier tipo de texto. Si ya le√≠ Los Miserables puedo leer lo que sea. Libro s√∫per recomendado."
1108,Diane,The Book Thief,"Oct 09, 2008",1,"I hated this book. There is so much I disliked about it that I'm not sure where to begin. I recognize that I am in the minority on this one and that many of my GR friends loved this novel, so there's no need to start screaming at me in the comments. This book just wasn't my cuppa, and that's OK. We're allowed to like different books.

My List
I think the thing I hated the most was the writing itself. The sentences were rough, uneven and felt unfinished. 

I hated that even though the sentences and chapters were short and choppy, the book was 550 pages long! Two hundred pages could have been cut from this sucker, easily.

I hated how Zusak wrote the narrator Death, and how Death was constantly foreshadowing things. Dude, I get it, you're omniscient. 

I hated that Zusak chose to put his cliched story about a girl who likes books against the backdrop of the Holocaust. It seemed like the author was milking a tragedy to try and make his book seem deeper than it is.

I hated that every scene was precious, oh so schmaltzy and precious! 

I hated that the characters were all two-dimensional and none of them seemed real. They were just a collection of anecdotes.

I hated that the entire book felt like a pretentious writing exercise by some smarmy grad student.

This is the second YA novel that I've hated this year, and I'm taking a break from the genre. I don't need books that are dumbed down. I like complex stories and characters, and beautiful writing that makes me want to underline passages. There wasn't a single sentence in The Book Thief that made me pause and appreciate its construction. Not one."
1109,Bionic Jean,Romeo and Juliet,"Sep 11, 2013",5,"Who does not know the story of Romeo and Juliet? And these immortal lines,

""O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?""

""But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.""

""Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.""

The very word ""Romeo"" has become synonymous with ""male lover"" in English, and the idea of the doomed romantic lovers, whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families, is famous world-wide. It has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical, opera and radio; the latest film went on general release just a few months ago in 2013.

However, Shakespeare did not invent the story of Romeo and Juliet. He reworked a long poem by Arthur Brooks, called ""The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet"", written in 1562. The tradition of tragic romances had been well established in literature - in particular Italian literature - for almost a hundred years, but what may be surprising is that many of the plot elements of Romeo and Juliet were all in Brooks' poem. The first meeting of the lovers at the ball, their secret marriage, Romeo's fight with Tybalt, the sleeping potion, and even the timing of their eventual suicides, are all episodes which we usually attribute to Shakespeare. This is characteristic of the author, who often wrote plays based on earlier works. 

Shakespeare's text is believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, and as such was one of his earliest performed plays, although not published until later. It was an immediate success; so popular that Shakespeare continued to rework and hone the notes from the play's performances. It was then first published in 1597, with later editions improving on it still further. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime, and has remained so, now being the most performed of all his plays alongside ""Hamlet."" Although the initial idea for Romeo and Juliet came from the earlier text, it is Shakespeare's wonderful play which is credited with having had such a profound influence on subsequent literature.

It starts with a short prologue, in sonnet form, which tells the audience what is to follow. Nobody can be in any doubt that the story is a tragedy about young love, and that it will take their deaths to bring an end to family feuds. We are then straight into the action, which is a masterly piece of writing, full of bawdy references to ensure his audiences' attention, while providing all the background information needed to understand the world of the play. We are immediately told about the long-standing hatred between the two feuding families, the Capulets and the Montagues, and then immediately find ourselves engaged by an exciting brawl. 

Shakespeare cleverly establishes some of the major themes of the play, right at its start. He also portrays all of the layers of Veronese society starting with the servants, right through to Prince Escalus. Many of the secondary characters important to the play are also introduced here; for instance, Romeo's friend, Benvolio, thoughtful, pragmatic and fearful of the law, and Juliet's cousin Tybalt, a hothead, professing a hatred for peace as strong as his hatred for Montagues. A modern audience becomes aware that in the Verona of this play, masculine honour is not restricted to indifference to pain or insult. Tybalt makes it plain that a man must defend his honour at all times, whether the insult is verbal or physical. 

Mercutio is established as another friend; one who who can poke friendly fun at Romeo quite mercilessly. Benvolio is not nearly so quick-witted. Mercutio is confident, constantly joking, making puns and laughing. He is a passionate man, but his passions are different from Romeo's love and Tybalt's hate. Their passions are founded respectively upon two ideals of society - love and honour - but Mercutio believes in neither. He comes across as the character with the clearest vision. Just as Mercutio can see through words to other meanings, he can also see through the ideals held by those around him. He understands that often they are not sincerely held, but merely adopted for convenience. 

The characters in this play are multi-layered and complex, and Shakespeare is adept in revealing their subtleties by means of the action. Even as Mercutio dies, he utters his wild witticisms, cursing both the Montagues and the Capulets, 

""A plague o' both your houses!
 They have made worms' meat of me!""

""Ask for me tomorrow, and 
You shall find me a grave man.""

The character of Romeo develops significantly from the first impression we have of him as a stock callow youth. At first he is melancholy, distracted and lovelorn, as we expect. But surprisingly he is not lovesick over Juliet, but is in love with Rosaline. This love seems to stem almost entirely from the reading of bad love poetry! We understand from this that Romeo's love for Rosaline is an immature love, more a statement that he is ready to be in love than actual love. Perhaps Rosaline, who never appears in the play, exists only to demonstrate Romeo's passionate nature, his love of being in love. 

We meet Juliet in scene 3, and learn that in the Verona of this play, her status as a young woman leaves her with no power or choice in any social situation. Juliet at 13 years old is completely subject to parental influence, and is being encouraged to marry her parent's choice of Paris. Lady Capulet observes wryly that that she had already given birth to Juliet herself when she was Juliet's current age, before she was 14.

In this way the forces that determine the fate of Romeo and Juliet are laid in place well before they even meet. Parental influence in the tragedy becomes a tool of fate. Juliet's arranged marriage with Paris, and the longstanding feud between Capulets and Montagues, will eventually contribute to the deaths of Romeo and Juliet. The reader enjoys the tension, and knowledge that terrible events are about to happen. Events and observations continually reinforce the presence and power of fate. 

Juliet's speeches have many different facets, and are capable of many interpretations. She often professes one thing, whilst we know she has an ulterior motive, and another intention. This is particularly evident when she is speaking to her parents, knowing that she intends to make her own decisions, she perversely wants to speak her mind, but deliberately couches her words in double meanings so that the truth will remain hidden. 

Juliet is a strong character in the play, particularly fascinating to a modern reader as she seems almost contemporary. She repeatedly goes against what is expected of women of her time and place, and takes action. The best example of this is when she drinks the sleeping potion. She comes up with many reasons why it might cause her harm, and recognises that drinking the potion might lead her to madness or even death. Yet she chooses to drink it anyway. This demonstrates a willingness to take her life into her own hands - and also hints at future events. There is never just one side to, or interpretation of, any event in this play. It is a portent. Juliet drinks the potion just as Romeo will later drink the apothecary's poison. 

Another instance of ominous foreshadowing is when the Nurse teases Juliet by saying that she is too tired to tell her what happened when she first met Romeo. This delay in telling Juliet the news is mirrored in a future scene, when the Nurse's anguish prevents her from relating news to Juliet and thereby causing terrible confusion. Another example of delicious dramatic irony is when Romeo is proclaiming his love to be the most powerful force in the world. Friar Laurence advises caution, saying, 

""These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triump die, like fire and powder
Which, as they kiss, consume"". 

The reader knows that the play is a tragedy, and that Romeo and Juliet will die. Shakespeare ingeniously manipulates the plot, so that we feel the impending doom, and are swept up in the inevitability of it all. Even the characters themselves are sometimes aware that they are pawns. Romeo cries, 

""O, I am fortune's fool!""
 
when he realises he has killed Tybalt. He knows that by killing his new wife's cousin, he will be banished from Verona, and feels the inevitability of the situation. This emphasises the sense of fate - or fortune - that hangs over the play. 

Juliet also indicates in her speeches the power of fate and predestination. In her final scene with Romeo, the last moment they spend alive together, she says that he appears pale, as if he were dead. She looks out of her window and cries, 

""O God, I have an ill-divining soul! 
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, 
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.""

This vision blatantly foreshadows the end of the play. The next time she sees Romeo, he will be dead. 

Friar Laurence is a pivotal character in the play. When we first see him he is collecting herbs and flowers for medicinal purposes, demonstrating a deep knowledge of the properties of the plants he collects, and alerting the reader to what may be to come. He meditates on the duality of good and evil that exists in all things; another clearly portentous speech. Referring to the plants, Friar Laurence says that, although everything in nature has a useful purpose, it can also lead to misfortune if used improperly, 

""For naught so vile that on the earth doth live 
But to the earth some special good doth give, 
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use 
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: 
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied; 
And vice sometime's by action dignified"". 

Friar Laurence ruminates on how good may be perverted to evil and evil may be purified by good. By making plans to marry Romeo and Juliet, he hopes that the good of their love will reverse the evil of the hatred between the feuding families. Shakespeare portrays him as a benign, wise philosopher. But his schemes also serve as tools of fate; secretly marrying the two lovers, sending Romeo to Mantua, and staging Juliet's apparent death. The tragic failure of his plans are outside his responsibility, and due to chance.

The structure of the play is carefully controlled; it would be interesting at this distance to read the earlier versions. Different poetic forms are used by different characters, and sometimes the form changes as the character develops. There are many instances of the sonnet, as the reader would expect, because it is a perfect, idealised poetic form often used to write about love. The play starts with a Prologue in sonnet form, a masterly precis of the story. As it describes Romeo and Juliet‚Äôs eventual death, it also helps to create the sense of fate that permeates the entire play.

Romeo himself, develops his expertise in the sonnet over the course of the play. When Romeo and Juliet meet they speak just fourteen lines before their first kiss. These fourteen lines make up a shared sonnet, which creates a link between their love and their tragic destiny, as told in the introductory prologue. 

There are numerous instances of such tightly written formal structure, which is remarkable in such an early play. Even the dramatic action of the play has a tight schedule, spanning just 4 days. Perhaps this is why many of the most important scenes, such as the balcony scene, take place either very late at night or very early in the morning. 

Shakespeare makes great use of effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten the tension, and bringing minor characters into the foreground to increase depth and interest. His additional use of sub-plots to enrich the story, is often cited as an early sign of his dramatic skill.

This play has everything; love, beauty, and romance, but also sudden, fatal violence early on. Viciousness and danger are continually present, yet just at the point when they threaten to overcome the reader, the action will be tempered by wit, comedy and humour. We are in a masculine world in which notions of honour, pride, and status are prone to erupt in a fury of conflict, but there is a strong female who defies her confined expectations. Rashness, vengeance, passion, grief; they are all here. The motif of fate continues to the very end of the play. Romeo proclaims, 

""Then I defy you, stars"" and

""I will lie with thee tonight"" in a last desperate attempt to control his own destiny by spending eternity with Juliet.

Yet in this ultimate example of tragic irony, this defiant act seals both his fate, and their double suicide. Shakespeare tells his audience that nothing can withstand the power of fate. The neat twists of the ending are supremely ironic, devastating and heart-wrenching. Here is Romeo, in despair,

""O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.""

And on waking, Juliet,

""I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative...
O happy dagger!
This is thy sheath...
There rust and let me die!""

It is said that the best way to appreciate Shakespeare is to go to a live performance of a play. Of course in one sense this is true of any play; the live action is how the play was intended to be experienced. But there is a lot to be said for reading Shakespeare on the page. The structure and poetry of the language is so much more evident. The puns and in-jokes are so much clearer. The reader can give pause to properly interpret the manifold meanings of both the exciting events and the rousing speeches. And above all we can marvel at the mastery of a writer who can still speak to us with relevance, move us with poetry and story, and entertain his audience well over 400 years later.

""For never was a story of more woe 
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."""
1110,Maureen,The Outsiders,"Jul 09, 2012",4,"I'm just feeling a lot of emotions right now don't toUCH ME.
I barely remembered anything about this book from reading it in high school but oh man it was definitely better than I remember. Even though I've never been in any of the situations referenced in the outsiders, the overall themes are meaningful and easy to grasp. REAL GOOD REAL GOOD."
1111,Lizzy,Crime and Punishment ,"Jul 18, 2016",5,"‚ÄúCrime? What crime? ... My killing a loathsome, harmful louse, a filthy old moneylender woman who brought no good to anyone, to murder whom would pardon forty sins, who sucked the lifeblood of the poor, and you call that a crime ?‚Äù
Just a few scattered toughts, for I do not know how to begin. After revisiting Crime and Punishment I am utterly troubled. What to do? What to say? In my opinion, to write a review of one of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's great masterpieces is a troublesome undertaking. To write a decent one, even harder. So here are just a few toughts, backed by Dostoyevsky's own words so that I don't blunder it all. One caveat: my review today will focus on Rodion Rom√°novich Raskolnikov, although there is much more to be said.
 
Ah, such fascinating despair. I had a period in my life when I went deep into Dostoevsky. Perhaps because his books made me contemplate about being human. This is a remarkable study in emotions, intense and anguished. 

‚ÄúRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was in the street he cried out, ""Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and can I, can I possibly‚Ä¶ . No, it's nonsense, it's rubbish!"" he added resolutely. ""And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!‚Äîand for a whole month I've been‚Ä¶ ."" But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. ‚Äù
 
Is it a miracle that I commiserated with Raskolnikov? That I resented his mother when he did and I loved her when he did? That I felt Raskolnikov's anxiety, and tried to tell him to turn back when he was climbing the steps to the old woman's apartment? But up he went. And that it anguished me because I new, as any reader would, what was bound to happen? Yes, his is not the kind of personality that I usually sympathize with. However, I could begin to understand him and his despair. Yes, Dostoyevsky created a very real character and I believed him enough to mentally immerse myself with his creation while submersed in his book. And this kept me turning the pages up to the last one.

‚ÄúNo, I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Granted, granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last month is clear as day, true as arithmetic‚Ä¶ . My God! Anyway I couldn't bring myself to it! I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Why, why then am I still ‚Ä¶ ?‚Äù
 
Raskolnikoff's justification for his act was that great and famous men, like Ceasar and Napoleon, were assassins absolved by history. He identified himself with those history figures. And that gave him the right to commit the crime. How could he explain the murder? I understand he just required a belief to explain it to himself. He was no Napoleon; he was not fighting in a war. And he knew it. What he needed was a moral argument that pushed him up the steps and lifted his arms in the final act. 

""And you don‚Äôt suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a wise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn't suppose that I didn't know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether I had the right to gain power‚ÄîI certainly hadn't the right‚Äîor that if I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn't so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his goal without asking questions.‚Ä¶ If I worried myself all those days, wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly of course that I wasn't Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn't want to lie about it even to myself. It wasn't to help my mother I did the murder‚Äîthat‚Äôs nonsense‚ÄîI didn't do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it; I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider, catching men in my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn't have cared at that moment.‚Ä¶ And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It was not so much the money I wanted, but something else.‚Ä¶ I know it all now.‚Ä¶ Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling creature or whether I have the right ‚Ä¶‚Äù

You will question as I finish: where are the other characters? Where is Raskolnikov‚Äôs sister Dunya; and what about Sonia, the one that prostituted herself to help her family and whom Raskolnikov sort of falls in love with? Yes, the women in the story turn out almost consistently to be the stronger characters, the source of redemption. What about the patetic Marmeledov; the the self-centered Luzhin; the drunken philanderer Svidrigailov? They are all fascinating in their own right, and important to the story. A much more crucial issue: what was behind Dostoyevsky's novel? Where is God, religion? For that I would have to go back to his Russia, to his time and his life. Nevertheless, all that will have to wait for a possible follow-up-review, today all my effort was on Raskolnikov and how I felt reading Crime and Punishment.

An outstanding classic about the human essence, about our darkest and deepest impulses. The unequivocal voice of each character, the sharp study of society, the movements of Raskolnikov, of the extreme reduction of hate to the redemption of love. Ultimately it reveals that our own inner consciousness can stand a far greater punishment than any legal system can. 

Brilliant!

1112,Federico DN,Divergent ,"Mar 12, 2014",5,"I choose Amity.  

In a dystopian future, in a post-apocalyptic world, society has divided itself into five factions. Candor, who want nothing but the truth; Erudite, who hold intelligence above all; Amity, who love and desire peace; Dauntless, who value strength and life without fear; and Abnegation, who devote themselves to selfless altruism. 

Beatrice Prior is born under the care of altruist parents, but at the tender age of sixteen she‚Äôll have to choose a faction to live with for the rest of her life. Her whole world has been Abnegation, but Dauntless also seems wild and full of life. And what about Erudition‚Ä¶ Her faction orientation test gives her unsettling results, something dangerous that may even put her life in danger; but she still needs to choose a faction, and fast‚Ä¶ before someone finds out.

LOVED IT. I love dystopian fiction and love YA, and this one was a perfect combination of both. Add to that a slow burn romance and fast paced plot full of action. Bingo. YA heaven. Loved watching Tris blossom from a shy selfless to a daring dauntless, without ever losing sight of her origins. The chemistry with Four was amazing, and the pair just make dual madness. Christina was also great. Caleb can go suck and egg. Oh yes and Peter and Eric, how could I forget those two! Yeah‚Ä¶ f*ck ‚Äòem.

The movie (2014) is a good adaptation, not at all great, but fairly faithful to the book. Most of the movie played real smoothly, some very great moments, capture the flag and zipline scenes among my top favorites, astoundingly beautiful scenery. Woodley plays a kickass Tris and Kravitz nails Christina, Judd ever so lovely. James as Four was ok, I guess. Will and Edward were shockingly disappointing, I remember them being kinda crucial to the book and terribly underused in the film. And as much as I love Winslet I think she didn't convince as a villain. Also the ending went a bit too far off-script for my taste and partially ruined what could‚Äôve been a wonderful ending. A flawed film, but still very decent to watch, all things considered.

 Yo elijo Cordialidad.  

En un futuro dist√≥pico, en un mundo post-apocal√≠ptico, la sociedad se ha dividido a s√≠ misma en cinco facciones: Verdad, aquellos que quieren nada m√°s que la sinceridad; Erudici√≥n, que estiman la inteligencia sobre todo; Cordialidad, que aman y desean la paz; Osad√≠a, que valoran la fuerza y vivir sin temor; y Abnegaci√≥n, que dedican su vida a un puro altruismo.

Beatrice Prior nace bajo la tutela de padres altruistas, pero a la tierna edad de diecis√©is deber√° elegir una facci√≥n en la cual vivir el resto de su vida. Todo su mundo ha sido Abnegaci√≥n, pero Osad√≠a tambi√©n parece tan salvaje y lleno de vida. Y no olvidar Erudici√≥n‚Ä¶ Su test de orientaci√≥n de facci√≥n da resultados inquietantes, algo peligroso que podr√≠a poner su vida en peligro; pero aun as√≠ debe elegir una facci√≥n y r√°pido‚Ä¶ antes de que alguien se entere.

LO AME. Amo la ficci√≥n dist√≥p√≠ca y amo lo Joven Adulto, y esto fue una perfecta combinaci√≥n de ambas. A√±adir a eso un romance de lento ardor y una trama de ritmo r√°pido lleno de acci√≥n. Bingo. Cielo joven adulto. Am√© ver a Tris florecer de una t√≠mida desinteresada a una valiente intr√©pida, sin nunca perder visi√≥n de sus or√≠genes. La qu√≠mica con Cuatro fue espectacular, y el par hacen locura dual. Christina tambi√©n fue genial. Caleb puede irse a chupar un huevo. Ah s√≠ y Peter y Eric, ¬°c√≥mo podr√≠a olvidarme de esos dos! S√≠‚Ä¶ que se pudran.

La pel√≠cula (2014) es una buena adaptaci√≥n, para nada grandiosa, pero bastante fiel al libro. Casi toda la pel√≠cula fluye muy bien, algunos momentos muy geniales, la escena de captura la bandera y la tirolesa entre mis m√°s favoritas, asombrosamente hermosa escenograf√≠a. Woodley hace una tremenda Tris, y Kravitz brilla como Christina, Judd siempre tan adorable. James como Cuatro estuvo bien, supongo. Will y Edward fueron chocantemente decepcionante, los recuerdo como algo crucial en el libro y terriblemente infrautilizados en la pel√≠cula. Y por m√°s que amo a Winslet creo que no fue convincente como villana. El final como que se sali√≥ un poco demasiado del gui√≥n para mi gusto y parcialmente arruin√≥ lo que pod√≠a haber sido un incre√≠ble final. Una pel√≠cula imperfecta, pero igualmente muy decente de ver, considerando todo.

1113,Shannon,Animal Farm,"Nov 08, 2008",5,"** spoiler alert **
           This is a book I've been meaning to read for ages but never got around to - last week I not only read it but gave a lesson on the historical context for the grade 8 class, who will be reading this book and The Wave. As I found, out of the class of 24, about 20 of them had already read the book, and at least one kid knew it was an allegory of the Russian Revolution. Still, my lesson wasn't totally redundant :)

For anyone who isn't familiar with the story, Animal Farm is about the animals on a farm in England rising up against the incompetent, cruel farmer (Mr Jones, who represents the deposed Tsar, Nicholas II) and taking over the farm, renaming it Animal Farm (USSR) and - so the glorious vision intended - running it for themselves, so their lives would be better.

The vision is given to them by a pig, Old Major, who dies not long afterwards. Old Major probably represents Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, and it's not the socialist ideal put forward that is critiqued by this book but how that vision is corrupted by certain other characters, namely another pig called Napoleon, who represents Joseph Stalin. Napoleon chases a pig called Snowball (Leon Trotsky) off the farm with his personally trained dogs (while still just the General Secretary of the Party, Stalin recruited people who would follow him blindly, so that when Lenin died in 1924 he was able to defeat Trotsky for the leadership position and his ""dogs"" kept everyone else in line).

The pigs then take charge, and with their literacy skills keep changing the rules the animals established in order to suit themselves, using a pig called Squealer to convince the other animals that their memories are faulty. After all, as the drafthorse Boxer keeps saying, ""Comrade Napoleon is always right"".

Boxer is - for me - the most heartbreaking character in the novel. He represents the peasants, and is the most hardworking animal on the farm. He has utter faith in the leadership of Napoleon and works himself to the bone - literally. His reward is very telling, though I don't want to give it away. Most of the characters represent either a person, several people or groups of people, and for the complete list you can check it out on Wikipedia.

Orwell, while a socialist, was very cynical about Stalin's communist USSR - and for good reason! Animal Farm is a very well-written critique of how socialist ideals are corrupted by powerful people, how the uneducated masses are taken advantage of, and how the dictator or communist leaders turn into capitalists (just look at China). It's a wonderful example of how effective the allegorical style/format can be, and a well-deserved classic."
1114,NickReads,Anne of Green Gables ,"Oct 10, 2018",0,Every edition of this book is truly beautiful.
1115,Jon Nakapalau,Fahrenheit 451,"Oct 11, 2016",5,One of my favorite books of all time - book burning lights the path to tyranny. This book should be required reading for all politicians; but if I had to guess it would be shocking how few of them have read it. With this new wave of book bannings cresting across America I think this book needs to be read now more than ever.
1116,Kat,The Hunger Games ,"May 09, 2020",4,she really was the blueprint
1117,Melanie,The Hunger Games ,"Apr 10, 2020",5,"Hello, I am back again with another breakdown review while I relearn how to write reviews. But basically the TL;DR of this review is that The Hunger Games truly holds up so well in 2020, and this reread was such a treat. I felt such nostalgia, happiness, and hope between these pages, and I already can‚Äôt wait to revisit this story again. Also, again, this review will have spoilers, so use caution if you don‚Äôt want me to tell you what happens in each chapter of this book!


‚ÄúHow could I leave Prim, who is the only person in the world I'm certain I love?‚Äù


 ‚ûΩ Chapter One: 
This first chapter really starts off with a heartbreaking bang. We quickly learn so many characters, but we even more quickly learn what type of character Katniss Everdeen is. The basic premise of this tale is that there are twelve districts and once a year each district will select two young candidates to fight to the death in a game, which will also be broadcasted for the world to see. Every year, a teenagers name gets added once to this random selection pool, but each year they get older another time their name gets added. Also, you can add your name more times to get food and supplies for your family, and this is very much the norm for most children. Katniss‚Äôs sister, Prim, only has her name in the drawing once because it is her first time, where Katniss has her name added over twenty times. Yet, you see where this is going‚Ä¶

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Two: 
Once Prim‚Äôs name is pulled, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place in the games. Meanwhile, the boy contestant is Peeta Mellark, who Katniss remembers giving her bread when her family was starving after the death of their father. Together, they are thrown into a competition that no one believes they will be able to come back alive. Especially since only one victor is allowed, therefore one of them will most certainly have to die.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Three: 
Katniss is given her iconic mockingjay pin that will literally change the world as she knows it.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Four: 
Haymitch punches Peeta to make him look rougher, lol. The journey Haymitch is about to take alongside these two kids as their mentor, whew.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Five: 
Cinna (my favorite character), makes Katniss a fire dress in which the world has never seen, and will be the first time the world finds it extremely hard to forget her or her name. Also, unknown to Katniss, a start of a public romance is brewing with Peeta to help their image. We also get to meet President Snow and start to get a vibe of all the evil things he has been stirring up for some time now.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Six: 
Katniss and Peeta make it to the training center and they start to learn about the other candidates from the other districts. We also get to learn about the different privileges of the other districts, and how some of these candidates view this as an honor to volunteer their life for (without needing to save a little sister). We also get to see Rue, and it‚Äôs really hard to not feel like you want to reach into the pages and protect her yourself.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Seven: 
Katniss makes quite the impression with an arrow and an apple, that many important people of the Capitol find very hard to ignore.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Eight: 
This is the start of the Peeta versus Gale debate, and the brewing of a very opinionated love-triangle. For me, personally, I always think it‚Äôs obvious in Katniss‚Äôs inner monologue that she only likes Peeta, but I digress.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Nine: 
We get to meet Caesar Flickerman and see Katniss and Peeta‚Äôs vastly different interviews with him. Peeta is coached to very much play the star-crossed lovers card, and he even tells Caesar that he loves Katniss more than anything.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Ten: 
This is the start of Part 2, where they games are finally going to begin. And Cinna says my favorite line in the entire series to Katniss. So simple, so beautiful, so heartbreaking.


‚ÄúI'm not allowed to bet, but if I could, I'd bet on you.‚Äù


 ‚ûΩ Chapter Eleven: 
The twenty-four tributes are entering the game, and in the middle is a cornucopia filled with weapons and supplies‚Ä¶ if you are brave enough to make a run for them. Peeta distracts her at the very start of the game, so Katniss doesn‚Äôt go for the bow. And we quickly see that people are starting to form groups to take out some of the weaker players.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Twelve: 
Katniss is proving that she will do whatever it takes to survive.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Thirteen: 
Katniss is still up in a tree, surviving, when she sees Rue and they form a silent plan together.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Fourteen: 
She does get the medicine she needs from someone out there watching her in the world, who is rooting for her and her life. After with the help of some killer, engineered wasps‚Ä¶ she is able to get down from this tree and gets a bow.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Fifteen: 
Katniss teams up with Rue, while they come up with a big plan to make it a little harder for the districts teaming up with all the supplies.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Sixteen: 
Yeah, Katniss blows up the whole cornucopia.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Seventeen: 
Yet, while Katniss and Rue are trying to meet up again with their mockingjay signals, Rue gets killed by a spear. Katniss sings to her, and realizes that nothing will be the same in her life again, no matter how long she has left.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Eighteen: 
Katniss is trying to deal with the hurt and pain and loss as best as she can, but she also is very hard of hearing in one of her ears now. And she also knows that Peeta has been wounded and is missing.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Nineteen: 
But beyond all else, Katniss is a tracker and a hunter, and she quickly looks for Peeta at a water source and finds him. They also share a kiss when they find shelter, and she vows that she is not going to let him die.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Twenty: 
This chapter has some beautiful foreshadowing of giving Peeta some berries.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Twenty-One: 
Basically, at this point, each contestant needs a certain supply very badly, so they place the things they need back in the middle of the map, and Katniss goes to retrieve theirs. She does get very injured in the process but makes it back to heal him. Thresh helped Katniss because of what she did for Rue.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Twenty-Two: 
Peeta takes care of Katniss and they get more care-packages because they are now the Capitol‚Äôs OTP and everyone is rooting for them and their romance.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Twenty-Three: 
Thresh dies, and it breaks my heart every time because I highkey always root for him too. District 11 just deserved better. Cato is still alive, still the biggest threat, and still hella annoying. And then we have some more berry foreshadowing when a girl dies eating some.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Twenty-Four: 
Now that there are only three people left (Katniss, Peeta, and Cato) the game makers want them to finally put an end to the 74th Hunger Games once and for all. Kato runs at them, while wolves start running after them.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Twenty-Five: 
And we quickly find out that the wolves are none other than the people who died in the games. Well, I think at least. They for sure have the tributes eyes, and it just makes it extra freaky. But basically, after some fighting and some monologues, Kato is dying to the wolves slowly, but Katniss puts him out of his misery. They were promised earlier that if Katniss and Peeta were the final two of the game that they could both win and live, but now the game makers are trying to change that game right before them. And since they are saying there can only be one victor, Katniss takes a risk with those beloved berries and her an Peeta threaten suicide before all the people watching from the comfort of their own homes.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Twenty-Six: 
But because they need a winner, they decide two is better than none, so they both are able to live. Katniss wakes up in a hospital where her body is healing and she is able to hear out of her one ear again. She gets to see Cinna, and believe that maybe their lives will be normal again. But Katniss quickly realizes that the Capitol is terribly upset that she played with them, and they are not going to ignore her actions in the game.

 ‚ûΩ Chapter Twenty-Seven: 
Katniss gets to see Peeta again, and they are forced to watch all the deaths that happened in the game during their winner‚Äôs interview. They both have taken so much damage physically and mentally, and they know that Snow is not through hurting them, or the people they love, by a longshot.

1118,Clare,Brave New World,"Jul 04, 2007",5,"As a teenager I went through a period of reading a vast number of distopian novels - probably all the teenage angst. This is the one that has continued to haunt me however, long after the my youthful cynicism has died it's death. It's basically a book about the utopian ideal - everyone's happy, everyone has what they want and EVERYTHING is based on logical principles. However, there is something very rotten at the heart. It's about how what we want isn't always what we should get. It looks at how state sponsered ""happiness"" can entirely miss the point. Perhaps, most importantly, it makes the case for individual freedom rather than authoritarian diktat. It should be read hand in hand with Mill's Utilitarianism to get a good idea of the philosophy that inspired it.

Incidentally, I gave this book to my boyfriend as a present for his 18th birthday ( a rather depressing gift I know). At the time he wasn't particularly freaked out by it and said that it didn't hold the same level of dread as say, 1984 or ""The Handmaid's Tale"". As he's got older however, he's found the idea more and more frightening. Six years later it has more of a sting in the tail for him. I don't know why this should be but I'll hazard a guess that as you get older you're idea of ""happiness"" becomes perhaps more complex, making the ideal of ""Brave New World"" even more disturbing."
1119,Arah-Lynda,The Secret Garden,"Sep 05, 2016",5,"Where, you tend a rose, my lad, a thistle cannot grow.



Originally published in 1911 The Secret Garden is a true children‚Äôs ¬†classic. ¬†One that adults should read as well. ¬†

Mary Lennox was born in India. ¬†A plain little girl she was not wanted by her mother or father and consequently handed over to the servants to raise. ¬†Because her Ayah and the other servants feared her mother would be angry if she was disturbed, Mary was consequently given her own way. ¬†She soon became a bossy, nasty, little girl who was frail, yellow and most often angry. ¬†When she was but 10 years of age both her parents and her Ayah succumbed to Cholera, leaving Mary alone with no-one to raise her.

But Mary has an uncle who lives in England on the Yorkshire moors and she soon finds herself at Misselthwaite Manor. ¬†Her Uncle lost his wife ten years ago to a tragic accident and since that time is rarely at the manor, choosing instead a life of solitude while travelling. ¬†So once more Mary is left on her own, only this time without an Ayah. ¬†Through talking and listening to Martha, a young servant at the manor, Mary soon learns about a mysterious secret garden. ¬†A garden behind a locked gate that no-one has opened in ten years. ¬†¬†And what is the source of that plaintive crying that Mary hears from time to time and everyone else pretends they do not.

A secret garden, a hundred room English Manor, the Yorkshire moors, a 12 year old Yorkshire boy bestowed with nigh on magical persuasion over the woodland creatures, a mysterious cry, lessons learned the hard way and the power of positive thinking. ¬†There is plenty to love in this story that can be easily digested by young and old alike. 

It is a short read, so take a break, curl up and spend a couple of ¬†hours with this charming children‚Äôs classic, guaranteed to fill you with wonder."
1120,Emily May,Brave New World,"Jun 06, 2012",1,"Wow, the anger over this rating! My first post for this book was a quote and a gif of Dean from Supernatural rolling his eyes and passing out. And people were pissed. How dare I?

Lol. I'm honestly just so tired of all the dumb comments demanding that I (all caps) ""ELABORATE"". It's been going on for SIX YEARS now. So I will: This is still one of the most boring emotionless books I have ever read. It seemed like a natural choice after I loved Orwell and Atwood but, my god, Huxley is a dry, dull writer. 

Another reviewer called this book a ""sleeping pill"" and that is a fantastic description. After all the hullabaloo with my original post, I borrowed Brave New World from my local library with the intention of reading it again to give a more detailed review for those freaking out in the comments. And I returned it after suffering through only a few pages. A few years later I got the ebook, thinking I would eventually make it through somehow. But I haven't. It's so mind-numbingly dull. I don't want to do it to myself. The Globalization of World Politics was more enjoyable than this book."
1121,Matt,Twilight ,"Jan 14, 2008",1,"there are so many problems with this book that i can't even begin to address them all. but i will say this, 'twilight' is probably one of the worst, if not THE worst, books i've ever read. the writing is amateurish at best [cliches, stereotypes, purple prose--how anyone can applaud meyer's prose is puzzling]; the editing--or lack thereof--is appalling [this is a 200 page novel, no more and probably less]; the grammar and syntax are unforgivably bad; the plot is onion-skin thin; and the characters are uniformly dull and uninspiring. 

it's hard to imagine how so many people got suckered into this book. the novel's protagonist, bella swan [really? i mean, really?], is a complete idiot. she has no dreams, no motivations, no ambitions, no hopes, no goals, and not a single original thought of her own. she spends 500 pages spewing endless platitudes and commenting on edwards 'perfect face,' 'amber eyes,' and 'perfectly-muscled chest' ad nauseum [those references number in the HUNDREDS, literally]. she constantly wonders why edward, a 100-year old domineering vampire, wants her. apparently she's the only one who doesn't realize how 'beautiful' she is. too bad, so sad. honestly, this is the kind of novel you'd expect see selling for $1.99 at the supermarket checkout, not winning all sorts of awards. at one point i was half-expecting to close the book and find fabio on the cover. and a glittery vampire? gimme a break. 

frankly, i'm mystified at its popularity. if nothing else, i guess it goes to show what clever marketing and stories of wish-fulfillment and so-called 'forbidden love' can do to some women. it's made meyer a multi-millionaire, i'm sure, and turned her publisher into a cash cow. i don't begrudge anyone his or her success, but when it comes via a turd like 'twilight,' it's well, more than a tad saddening. 

'twlight' apologists will say that 'at least young women are reading!'i guess you could make that argument, but with that kind of logic you might as well congratulate an anorexic for eating a marshmallow."

1123,Ella M. („ÅÇ„ÅÑ„Åø„Åß„Åô) - Busy with college,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Oct 11, 2021",5,"This is one of my all time favorite book series. Seriously, TCoN (and LotR!) is what I grew up on. I never really attempted to review it (I'm not really going to try now) because I don't even know what I can say about it that will accurately express how much I love this series and how big of an impact it had/has on my life, both now and when I first read it when I was just a little kid.

Of course I do like some of the books more than others‚ÄîI do have my favorites‚Äîbut overall, this whole series is just so great.

This series will always hold a special place in my heart. I encourage you to read it, even if you think you're too old for it!


‚ÄúA children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.‚Äù

1125,Jeremy,The Giving Tree,"Jun 07, 2007",2,"The book is impossible to wrap my mind around. Part of me wishes it ended thusly: the tree suggests the boy chop her down to make a boat, he takes her advice, and the tree falls on him, killing them both. The moral being a quote I've heard attributed to Bill Cosby: If you spend your whole life trying to make other people happy, YOU'LL never be happy. The boy is punished for all but raping the one who cares more for him than anyone in the world, and the tree pays the ultimate price for a lifetime of allowing herself to be a doormat, or, alternately, finally gets her revenge. 

Who knows what Silverstein was trying to get across with this alternately touching and troubling parable? An ex-girlfriend of mine gave this book to me as a present early in the relationship. What was SHE trying to get across? I can't give anything as tangibly mind-boggling as ""The Giving Tree"" an entirely negative review, and as always the art is cute and affecting. And who can say, maybe the guy just wanted to tell a little story about a nice tree? Foremost among Silverstein's many gifts (apart from the more obvious talents of humor and rhyming) were pathos and irreverence. In the case of ""The Giving Tree"", for this reader anyway, it's very difficult to determine which of those traits is rearing its head here. 

Bottom line: It's not a good present for your significant other."
1126,Federico DN,Dracula,"Feb 24, 2014",4,"What a Leech!  

London, 1890s. Jonathan Harker returns from Transylvania, a series of bizarre incidents start taking place all around Whitby soon after. Worst of all, a strange malady seems to be slowly draining the life out of the helpless Lucy. Mina, her most trusted friend, unable to help her. After some investigations it‚Äôs concluded the deed to be the sole work of a mysterious figure of the night, none other than Count Dracula himself. Jonathan Harker, Mina‚Äôs fianc√©, and Professor Van Helsing, the only ones that may be able to stop him, once and for all.

This is IT! The original work, the mother of all bloodsuckers, the holy grail of vampirism, the genius masterpiece of Bram Stoker that for better or worse spanned an infinity of books, movies, series and any vampire-like machination. The story of the intrepid Jonathan Harker and the delicate Mina, the gentlemanly Arthur and the angelic Lucy, the charismatic Doctor Seward and the wise and audacious Van Helsing. And of course, how to forget him, the all-father of anything undead, the quintessential vampire, the immortal, machiavellian and all powerful Count Dracula. (view spoiler)[ May he rest in peace.  (hide spoiler)]

An all-time classic that hardly requires any introduction at all, and a must in life for any bookworm. Not my favorite classic, the pacing sucks, and not exactly easy to read either, but still a better story than Twilight. Recommendable, for the classical nerd.

It‚Äôs public domain, you can find it HERE.

*** Dracula (1992) is an acceptable adaptation, reasonably faithful to the original work, but with many deviations, none of them too bothersome. An out of this world cast including stars like Keanu, Wynona, Hopkins, Oldman and Elwes, that sadly didn‚Äôt amount to much. Not their best performance at all, and I especially disliked Sadie Frost as Lucy. Some none scripted scenes, awkward atmosphere and pacing, and honestly on the whole a little over the top. Not my favorite film at all; still, decent enough to watch, if only to complement the reading. The book definitely won this round.

 ¬°Vaya Sanguijuela!  

Londres, 1890. Jonathan Harker regresa desde Transilvania, una serie de bizarros incidentes empiezan a surgir por todo Whitby poco despu√©s. Lo peor de todo, una extra√±a aflicci√≥n parece estar lentamente drenando la vida de la indefensa Lucy. Mina, su m√°s querida amiga, incapaz de ayudarla. Despu√©s de algunas investigaciones se concluye que la obra es el trabajo de una misteriosa figura de la noche, nada menos que el mism√≠simo Conde Dr√°cula. Jonathan Harker, el prometido de Mina, y el Profesor Van Helsing, los √∫nicos que tal vez puedan llegar a detenerlo, de una vez por todas.

¬°Esta ES! La obra original, la madre de todas las chupa-sangre, el santo grial del vampirismo, la genial obra maestra de Bram Stoker que para bien o mal dio nacimiento a infinidad de libros, pel√≠culas, series, y cualquier maquinaci√≥n vampiresca. La historia del intr√©pido Jonathan Harker y la delicada Mina, del caballeroso Arthur y la ang√©lica Lucy, del carism√°tico Doctor Seward y el sabio y audaz Van Helsing. Y por supuesto, como olvidarlo, el padre de todos los no muertos, el murci√©lago por excelencia, el inmortal, maquiav√©lico y todopoderoso Conde Dr√°cula. (view spoiler)[ Que en paz descanse.  (hide spoiler)]

Un cl√°sico de todos los tiempos que dif√≠cilmente requiera introducci√≥n alguna. Y un deber para la vida de cualquier nerd de biblioteca. No es mi cl√°sico favorito, el ritmo apesta y no es exactamente f√°cil de leer tampoco, pero definitivamente una mejor historia que Crep√∫sculo. Recomendable, para el nerd de los clasicos.

Es dominio p√∫blico, lo pueden encontrar ACA.

*** Dracula (1992) es una aceptable adaptaci√≥n, razonablemente fiel a la obra original, pero con varias desviaciones, ninguna de ellas demasiado molesta. Un elenco de otro mundo incluyendo estrellas como Keanu, Wynona, Hopkins, Oldman y Elwes, que tristemente no hizo mucho eco. Lejos de ser sus mejores actuaciones, y especialmente me desagrad√≥ Sadie Frost como Lucy. Algunas escenas fuera de guion, rara atm√≥sfera y ritma, y honestamente en su conjunto un poco desmesurada. Para nada mi filme favorito; pero igualmente, suficientemente decente de ver, aunque sea s√≥lo para complementar la lectura. El libro definitivamente gan√≥ esta pelea.

1127,Jason Koivu,Charlotte's Web,"Aug 15, 2010",5,"I don't give a fig if it is a kid's book, Charlotte's Web is one of the most well-crafted stories ever written. This classic children's tale deserves 5 stars for story craft and language usage alone! (Read your Strunk & White to understand this man's talents in that regard.) The fact that it's a heart-warmer/wrencher clinches it. Never was I made to love pigs and spiders so much in my life. Charlotte's Web will always rank high amongst my favorites. But why, for the love of god, did they make us watch the cartoon version of this tear-jerker in school? Did they want to make us weep embarrassingly in front of one another? If so, mission accomplished, you sadistic school district!"
1128,emma,Romeo and Juliet,"Jan 27, 2016",4,"every time someone refers to romeo and juliet as the greatest romance of all time, a pretentious high school english teacher's pet writing their final paper on how stupid these two bozos are loses their wings.

1129,Lu√≠s,Os Miser√°veis,"Jun 24, 2020",5,"Of all the French literary classics, undoubtedly, The Miserables is unforgettable. For those who know the work, it is undeniable that it always leaves something of transitory reflection (or not) in us. For those unfamiliar with the book, as the title explicitly represents, it talks about human disability. The main character, Jean Valjean, portrays the injustice committed by ""justice."" He is arrested and convicted for a certain period when he steals bread at a market to satisfy the nostalgic hunger of his sister and his nephews. But for trying to escape several times, his sentence is always prolonged. People understood that he spent fifteen years there working as a prison worker. Despite being the main one, Jean Valjean is not the only one who stands out in this story. We cannot forget about Francine, a beautiful young woman with long blond hair and perfect teeth. His smile would delight any reader who read the book's description, but this beauty is short-lived. Due to the conditions, she leaves her only daughter in the care of a greedy couple who likes to take advantage of everything. Perhaps because of the irony of fate, Francine's daughter falls into the consideration of Jean Valjean, and this one, if I may say, cares like his own daughter. But as in real life, nothing is peaceful. Fiction also gains a touch of rarity, and a detective chases Jean several times.
If he gets caught or not? What happens to the girl? What happens to Francine? If we're there other characters? What else happens in this extraordinary adventure? Just if you read the book to know. But I will tell you one thing: you will not regret it."
1130,Leonard Gaya,Nineteen Eighty-Four,"Feb 25, 2014",5,"1948: Europe was only starting to recover from the slaughter of World War II. Nazi Germany had been crushed by the Russian army in the East and by the Anglo-American forces in the West. The totalitarian regimes of Hitler, Mussolini and Imperial Japan were defeated. Stalin was going strong. Franco was undisturbed. However, the war was not quite over: the victors, Russia on one side, the USA on the other, were now superpowers staring stonily at each other, their hands loaded with a new and deadly arsenal.

Orwell wrote 1984, right after Animal Farm, in this ominous post/cold/perpetual-war context, and many aspects of it are steeped in the horrors of tyranny, dehumanisation and disaster. Winston Smith, the wretched protagonist, lives in an alternate history where everyone is under constant surveillance (via ‚Äútelescreens‚Äù and widespread denunciation). A place where propaganda, misinformation, history re-writing, language and thought manipulation, ‚Äúreality control‚Äù (2+2=5) are pervasive tools to make every individual conform with the ‚ÄúIngsoc‚Äù Party‚Äôs ideology. The result is a diehard totalitarian state, a perfect hell on earth, where individuality is ‚Äúvaporised‚Äù at the whim of a spectral Big Brother and where even love is impossible.

Worth highlighting in the novel: the long interlude about ‚ÄúThe Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism‚Äù (II, 9) ‚Äî inserted within a slightly incongruous romance episode ‚Äî and the appendix on ‚ÄúThe Principles of Newspeak‚Äù ‚Äî written as if from an unknown point, far in the future, when the madness has eventually subsided. Both sections are stupefying. Yet, the last third of the book is probably one of the worst nightmares in literature: a prolonged torture and brainwashing session that plunges into utter insanity. 

Erich Fromm‚Äôs afterword (included at the end of the Signet Classics paperback edition) rightly puts 1984 in perspective with its historical context and other works of speculative fiction, like Brave New World. Still, while Huxley‚Äôs satire is substantially ironic, almost jovial, the general tone in Orwell‚Äôs book is dismal, revolting, at times practically unbearable. At any rate, this novel has become one of the canonical landmarks of political dystopia. Hannah Arendt possibly read 1984 when writing The Origins of Totalitarianism a couple of years after Orwell‚Äôs death. Its influence after that, on works like The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, is manifest as well.

Michael Radford‚Äôs heartrending film adaptation is very faithful to the novel. But my favourite film ‚Äúfree-adaptation‚Äù remains Brazil by Terry Gilliam. Blade Runner, too, borrows much of its 2019 Los Angeles architecture from 1984‚Äôs Miniluv pyramidal building descriptions.

The days of Hitler and Stalin are long gone now. Even so, almost a century later, in a time of political paralysis and corruption, where the most prominent ‚Äúdoubleplusgood duckspeaker‚Äù politicians of the world make ample use of a new form of newspeak and doublethink; in a time of threatened privacy and increasing digital surveillance and mindfuck, Orwell‚Äôs prophetic warning is as relevant as ever."
1131,MJ Nicholls,A Game of Thrones ,"Sep 01, 2013",0,"Reader Logic:

I HATE this book.

I HATE it so much I had to get a new hardback copy to read so I could underline all the parts I HATE about it so much and post them on Goodreads.

I HATE it with such a passion I also bought copies for all my friends and family, also in new hardback editions, so they could HATE it along with me.

When the TV series came on I was so fuming with rage I watched the entire season twice and bought six copies of the DVD, because I could not believe how much I could HATE something.

I had spent so much time discussing how much I HATE this, with all my friends, who HATE it too and who all bought copies, I decided to get a George RR Martin tattoo on my buttock to show how strong my HATRED for his work is. 

There was such a collectivity at the time‚Äîlike everyone uniting in HATING this together‚Äîthat some of us formed relationships in HATE. I met my wife at a George RR Martin convention and we got married as one of the characters, reciting parts of the book for our vows, and paid GRRM all our life savings to come read from his HORRIBLE book. 

We HATE this beyond belief. Maybe one day, we‚Äôll read a book we like, and the author can get rich on LOVE."
1132,emma,The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure,"May 01, 2019",5,"This book has, as you may know:

Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles.

https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...

And if you like any of those things, or all of those things, or several of them or none of them, or if you find any of them exciting, or compelling, or curiosity-inducing at all, then you simply have to read it.

This is one of those extraordinarily rare cases when the film adaptation sometimes prompts people to say the uncommon phrase ‚ÄúThe movie is better than the book.‚Äù Those people are wrong, but less wrong than those who usually say it. 

The movie is funny, and exciting, and brilliantly casted, and truer to the book than anyone has any real right to expect (thank you, William Goldman, for adapting your own work).

But here‚Äôs a by no means exhaustive list of what it‚Äôs missing:
- the full extent of the author‚Äôs wit
- character backstories so rich you‚Äôll feel their trials and tribulations intensely
- a fictional history so convincing that I spent most of my childhood (and some of my adolescence) believing that Europe included long-warring countries called Florin and Guilder
- masterful themes on the meaning of storytelling and truth in literature
- the chance to be awestruck by a book over and over and over again

So yes, you should watch the movie. Sure. It‚Äôs great. 

But more than that, you should read the book.

(I‚Äôll even say it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôve seen the movie already. Your fun won‚Äôt be spoiled in the slightest.)

Bottom line: I truly and sincerely pity anyone who has not read and has no intention of reading The Princess Bride.

It‚Äôs the best thing in the world, after cough drops.

1133,Betsy,The Hunger Games ,"Jun 02, 2008",5,"** spoiler alert **
           Clearly Gregor was merely the prelude. Suzanne Collins, you‚Äôve been holding out on us, missy. As an author we were accustomed to your fun adventures involving a boy, his sister, and a world beneath our world. I think it's fair to say that we weren‚Äôt really expecting something like The Hunger Games. At least I wasn‚Äôt. But reading it gave me a horribly familiar feeling. There is a certain strain of book that can hypnotize you into believing that you are in another time and place roughly 2.3 seconds after you put that book down.  Life As We Knew It by Susan Beth Pfeffer could convince me that there were simply not enough canned goods in my home. And The Hunger Games? Well as I walked down the street I was under the disctinc impression that there were hidden cameras everywhere, charting my progress home. Collins has written a book that is exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns. It ascends to the highest forms of the science fiction genre and will create all new fans for the writer. One of the best books of the 2008 year.
 
Life in District 12 isn‚Äôt easy for Katniss and her family. Ever since her father died the girl has spent her time saving her mother and little sister Prim from starvation by hunting on forbidden land. But worst of all is reaping day. Once a year the government chooses two children from each of the twelve districts to compete against one another in a live and televised reality show. Twenty-four kids and teens enter, and only one survives. When Prim's name is called, Katniss exchanges herself without hesitation to compete alongside the baker‚Äôs boy Peeta. To survive in this game you need to win the heart of your audience, and so District 12‚Äôs trainers come up with a plan. Why not make it as if Peeta and Katniss were in love with one another? But in a game where only one person can live, Katniss will have to use all her brains, wits, and instincts to determine who to trust and how to outwit the game's creators.
 
I described the plot of this book to my husband, particularly the part where Katniss and Peeta fake being in love to gain the audience‚Äôs approval and the very first thing he said was, ‚ÄúOh! That‚Äôs the plot of They Shoot Horses, Don‚Äôt They?"" Then I mentioned that it took place in the future and that government leaders set up teenagers to fight one another to the death and he said, ""Battle Royale‚Äù. So sure, there are parts of this plot that have been done before. You could say it's The Game meets Spartacus with some Survivor thrown in for spice. But that‚Äôs not what makes a book good or bad, is it? Some of the greatest works of literature out there, regardless of the readerships' age, comes about when an author takes overdone or familiar themes and then makes them entirely new through the brilliance of their own writing. Harry Potter wouldn‚Äôt have been any great shakes if it weren‚Äôt for Rowling‚Äôs storytelling. Similarly, Collins takes ideas that have certainly seen the light of day before and concocts an amazingly addictive text. About the time you get to the fifth chapter that ends with a sentence that forces you to read on, you‚Äôre scratching your head wondering how the heck she DOES that.
 
Your story often rests on the shoulders of the protagonist. Is this a believable character? Do you root for him or her? Because basically it is a very hard thing to create a ‚Äúgood‚Äù person on the page that your reader is going to fall in love with. Because we readers know that we are flawed, we are often inclined to side with the similarly flawed people we meet between a book‚Äôs covers. Katniss, on the other hand, is so good in so many ways. She sacrifices herself for her sister. She tries to save people in the game. But there‚Äôs almost a jock mentality to her too. Katniss can figure out the puzzles and problems in the game, but when it comes to emotional complexity she‚Äôs sometimes up a tree. Most remarkable to me was the fact that Katniss could walk around, oblivious to romance, and not bug me. Seriously, nothing gets under my skin faster than heroines who can‚Äôt see that their fellow fellas are jonesing for them. You just want to bonk the ladies upside the head with a brick or something. The different here is maybe the fact that since Katniss knows that Peeta has to play a part, she uses that excuse (however unconsciously) to justify his seeming affection for her. Thems smart writing.
 
Oh! And did I mention the dialogue at all? The humor? Yep, there‚Äôs humor. We‚Äôre talking about a story where adolescents hunger for blood, and Katniss is getting in lines about her trainers like, ‚ÄúAnd then, because it‚Äôs Effie and she‚Äôs apparently required by law to say something awful...‚Äù Good stuff. The words pop off the page. And then there‚Äôs the fact that we‚Äôre dealing with a dystopian novel where the author has somehow managed to create a believable future. No faux slang here, or casual references to extinct dolphins. There are some animals that were scientifically altered, but you can‚Äôt have a future without a couple cool details like that, right?
 
In general, this book throws a big fat wrench into the boy book/girl book view of child/teen literature. People love to characterize books by gender. It stars a boy? Boy book. A girl? Girl book. Now take a long lengthy look at the first book in the Hunger Games Trilogy. It stars a girl... and a boy too. There‚Äôs a lot of hunting, fighting, and survival... and a lot of romance, kisses, and cool outfits. There‚Äôs strategy, the world‚Äôs most fabulous fashion designer, weapons and a girl who knows how to fight. This is not a book that quietly slots into our preconceived stereotypes. And you know what happens to books that span genders? They sell very well indeed. That is, if you can get both boys and girls to read them.
 
The age range? Well, for most of this story I would have said ten and up. I mean, yeah the basic premise is that a lot of teenagers go around killing one another, and sure there‚Äôs some romance to deal with, but none of it really seems inappropriate... until a final death scene appears in the book. I won‚Äôt give any details, but suffice it to say it is gruesome. There are definite horror elements to it as well, so with that in mind I am upping my recommendation to 12 and up. I‚Äôm sure that there are 10-year-olds out there who‚Äôve seen much worse stuff on cable, just as there are 12-year-olds who‚Äôll freak out ten pages in. Still, I‚Äôm more comfortable recommending it for the older kids rather than the younger. You'll see why.
 
It occurs to me that there has never been a quintessential futuristic gladiator book for kids. That is undoubtedly the roughest term you can give this book. Now I‚Äôm not a person who cries easily when she reads something, particularly something for kids. Yet as I was taking a train to Long Island I found myself tearing up over significant parts of this story. It‚Äôs good. And it‚Äôs so ridiculous that a work of science fiction like this could even be so good. You think of futuristic arena tales and your mind instantly sinks to the lowest common denominator. What Collins has done here is set up a series that will sink its teeth into readers. The future of this book will go one of two ways. Either it will remain an unappreciated cult classic for years to come or it will be fully appreciated right from the start and lauded. My money lies with the latter. A contender in its own right.

Ages 12 and up."

""He must have crawled away away from the others,"" Jon said. 

""Or been driven away,"" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.

""Boy,"" a voice called out to him. Jon turned. 

Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. ""Is that a wolf?""

""A direwolf,"" Jon said. ""His name is Ghost."" He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly forgotten. ""What are you doing up there? Why aren't you at the feast?""

""Too hot, too noisy, and I drunk too much wine,"" the dwarf told him. ""I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your wolf?""

Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly. ""Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?""

""Oh, bleed that,"" the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs,


And he does this: 




""One word,"" Tyrion said, ""and I will hit you again.""

""I'm going to tell Mother!"" Joffery exclaimed. 

Tyrion hit him again. Now both cheeks flamed


Oh if he only killed him off right then. And his mother for that matter but I digress.

Old Review

I love the book and the shows. I still have the other books to read. The only thing I don't like is the killing of the wolves and horses and the rapes, but we know those things are going to happen. 

And I will not like anyone again on the shows or in the books because every time I do they get killed! So, I'm just going to pretend I can't stand them all :) 

I love the book and the characters. I hope to see some good revenge in some of the other books and I hope some certain lady takes most all of them out. I'm not saying any names in case I jinx it :)"

1136,Patrick,The Alchemist,"Aug 26, 2008",2,"Timing is everything. If I'd read 'The Alchemist' four years ago, I'm sure I would have loved it. It deals in big, bold pronouncements of 'follow your dreams' et cetera et cetera, and it certainly makes you think about your own life and the pursuit of your own ""Personal Legend"" if you will. But maybe I'm older and more cynical now, or maybe it's not cynicism so much as just seeing a reality that isn't so mystical and black and white as Paulo Coelho's, but in any event, I just wasn't buying what 'The Alchemist' was selling.

It's a good, quick read, I'll give it that. I enjoyed myself, and I definitely thought a little bit about my own life in the process, which I appreciate from my literature. And while I was more or less with it for a while, I just couldn't stay on board with an ending that left me saying, ""that's it? Really?"" 
Be forewarned, there will be spoilers after this point
. The whole book Santiago is in pursuit of his ""Personal Legend"", which he is told is a great treasure found in the pyramids of Egypt. Along the way he befriends many people and makes a great sum of money, while also meeting a beautiful young woman who agrees to more or less be his life-partner, Romeo and Juliet-style (which is stupid in and of itself, but more on that later). It is at this point that he determines he has achieved a greater treasure than any he had ever dreamed of, and would go no further. Beautiful. Cue the music and themes of recognizing treasure in all its forms. Santiago has a wonderful, fulfilling life laid out before him, and would most likely die a happy man by the side of his lovely wife and adoring children, all while living comfortably as village counselor of a beautiful desert oasis. Sounds pretty nice, no?

Well, that's where the book lost it's footing. Santiago is urged, coerced even, into continuing to follow his ""Personal Legend"", leaving behind his ""love"" (who, it should be mentioned is a ""woman of the desert"" and so is completely fine being abandoned by her ""love"" and will simply wait and wait and wait for him, whether he ever returns or not) traversing the desert and (bizarrely) evading a hostile army along the way by turning himself into the wind (it makes about as much sense as it sounds). In the end though, Coelho reveals to us that Santiago does, indeed, reach his ""Personal Legend"" in a two and a half page epilogue, where it is shoddily revealed that Santiago's long-sought after treasure is...treasure. Literally. Buried treasure. A box in the sand filled with gold coins and diamonds and jewelry and crowns, and all the other cliche treasure images you can think up. What the hell?

So what message are we supposed to take from this book then? Money is the most important thing in the world? Women are objects meant to be seen and valued for their beauty, there to serve you and wait around forever while you go on wild goose chases across continents in search of money? 

Obviously I'm being facetious, and Coelho intended to say that one should follow their dreams no matter what, even if it transcends a nice, content life, so long as you are in pursuit of a life that would be even greater than you can ever imagine, sacrificing what is good now for what can be great later. But he did so in an extremely simplistic way, and the revelation of the Santiago's treasure being literally treasure was a major disappointment.

The thing was, despite his simplicity, the book had a nice message going for a while. If Fatima was Santiago's treasure, that I could have gotten behind, even if it shows a good deal of contempt for the role of women in relationships (beauty being the most important factor in deciding on a mate, as Santiago is struck by her beauty and immediately professes his love; Fatima more or less acquiesces immediately and pledges herself to Santiago no matter what, even if he must travel the desert forever in selfish pursuit of his own dreams, with no regard for her), because that is something intangible that is meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of financial standing. But then Coelho basically goes on to say that that is just a roadblock in the way of real achievement, and that one should selfishly pursue their own dreams with no regard for those closest to them.

How a book can go on and on talking about seeing the everyday symbols and omens in life and taking heed of them, presumably leaving metaphors for life all along the way, and then have what was presumably the biggest metaphor of them all, Santiago's treasure, turn out not to be a metaphor at all, but just money? To me, that summed up everything. I suppose Coelho realizes this, as he begins the book with a brief fable about Narcissus falling into the river because he loved staring at his reflection, and the river's disappointment in this, as the river loved gazing into Narcissus's eyes and seeing the reflection of itself. This is a horrible little story implying that everyone is obsessed only with themselves, a sad, empty little thought that Coelho spends 167 pages endorsing wholeheartedly, under the guise of following your dreams.

I understand that other people love this book and find it inspiring, and I think I would have felt the same way years ago, when I was just out of college and it appeared I had my whole life ahead of me and a lifetime to live it. I'm older now, and I've found someone who I consider to be a real treasure, and while I still have dreams, I'm not willing to sacrifice the happiness that this life brings me every day in a single-minded pursuit of something that I want for selfish reasons (fame, fortune, etc.). If I was Santiago, I would have never left Fatima in the first place if she truly made me happy, as Santiago claimed she did. Perhaps that makes me a coward in Coelho's eyes, not unlike the Crystal merchant from the story. But it'd also make me not the sad Englishman, whose single-minded pursuit of his ""personal legend"" had cost him all his money, friends, and family and left him alone in an oasis burning lead in a tent in the vain hopes it will turn to gold.

I guess what I'm trying to say in this long-winded review, is that this book is all about being selfish and doing what you think will make you happy, regardless of everything else. I can see why that appeals to people, especially those who want to show the doubters and find their own treasure beneath a sycamore tree, but it's sad, in a way. We live in a culture where everyone wants selfish things like fame or money or power, just to satisfy some gaping hole in their own souls, ignoring the real problems that lead to these compulsions in the first place. To me, this book feeds and even encourages that misplaced ideal, and that's a shame."

ROMEO: I‚Äôm Romeo, and I used to be emo and annoying but now I‚Äôm so totally in luuuuurve and it‚Äôs AWESOME. 

MERCUTIO: Okay, three things: One, there‚Äôs only room in this play for one awesome character and it‚Äôs me, bitch. Two, you‚Äôre still emo and annoying. Three, didn‚Äôt you say that exact same stuff yesterday about Rosaline?

ROMEO: Who?

*meanwhile, Juliet prances around her room and draws hearts on things and scribbles ‚ÄúMrs. Juliet Montague‚Äù in her diary over and over. Because she is THIRTEEN. How old is Romeo supposed to be? Let‚Äôs not talk about that, k?*

CAPULET: Good news, Juliet! I found you a husband!

PARIS: Hello, I‚Äôm a complete tool. 

JULIET: Daddy, I don‚Äôt want to marry that apparently decent and unflawed guy! I‚Äôm in love with Romeo Montague ‚Äì we met yesterday and it was HOT. 

CAPULET: I WILL BE DAMNED IF I SEE MY ONLY DAUGHTER MARRIED TO THE ONLY SON OF THE MAN WHO IS MY MORTAL ENEMY FOR REASONS TOO UNIMPORTANT TO SPECIFY IN THIS PLAY!

JULIET: *stamps foot, runs off to her room to watch High School Musical again and sulk*

TYBALT: Hey Romeo, your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!

MONTAGUE POSSE: Oh, snap.

MERCUTIO: YOU TAKE THAT BACK! 

TYBALT: MAKE ME! 

ROMEO: No! You can‚Äôt fight him, Mercutio because I already married his cousin! 

TYBALT: I KEEL YOU! 

*Romeo attempts to stop the fight and fails miserably*

MERCUTIO: FUCK YOU ALL! *dies*

ROMEO: Okay, forget what I said about not fighting. I KEEL YOU!

TYBALT: *dies*

PRINCE: I‚Äôve had enough of your shit, Emo McStabbypants. You‚Äôre banished. 

ROMEO: Waaaaaahhhhhh! I‚Äôm banished and Juliet is going to marry another guy and it‚Äôs not fair WHY DOES GOD HATE ME?

FRIAR LAURENCE: Jesus Christ, not this again. Okay, if you promise to grow a pair, I‚Äôll help you and your wife out. Here‚Äôs the plan: she takes a potion that‚Äôll make her go into a coma, and then she‚Äôll get put in the family tomb and then you‚Äôll sneak back into town, break into the tomb, wait until she wakes up, and then the two of you escape and live happily ever after! It‚Äôs perfect!

AUDIENCE: ‚Ä¶the hell?

*Shockingly, the plan fails. Romeo goes back to the tomb (pausing to kill Paris just for good measure), but he thinks Juliet‚Äôs dead and drinks poison and dies, and then like two seconds later she wakes up and sees that Romeo isn‚Äôt mostly dead like she was, he‚Äôs dead, so she stabs herself.*

MONTAGUE: Wow, we are awful parents. 

CAPULET: I have an idea ‚Äì let‚Äôs make solid gold statues of our dead children to commemorate their love and serve as a constant reminder of the fact that our only children killed themselves because we were such uncaring parents. 

*they actually do this.*

1144,Lisa of Troy,The Catcher in the Rye,"Nov 05, 2020",3,"It was one of the best books and one of the worst books that I have ever read. 
 
Here is the link to my more in-depth review:
https://youtu.be/8ZVbr7odygM

On the one hand, we have a character, Holden, who is not incredibly likeable. On the other hand, the book is really about some incredibly deep topics without being preachy at all. There is quite a bit of mild swearing so if that is something that you are sensitive about, this book is not for you. 

Often touted as a coming of age book, I beg to differ. This book is about loss and grief, struggling. Well worth the read at least once.

1145,karen,The Outsiders,"Sep 02, 2010",3,"the outsiders is a book about a group of youthful greasers living in oklahoma, and about their struggles to exist in a society that seems designed to dismiss them. 

oklahoma is also the name of a popular musical.

draw your own conclusions, or continue reading.

see, i don't know from oklahoma in the sixties. maybe that is a place where street toughs call their little brothers ""honey"" and ""baby"" and enjoy sunsets and stars and reading margaret mitchell aloud to one another and who recite robert frost in quiet moments. maybe they do gymnastics before what they call ""skin fighting"" with the local rival boys. maybe they cry and snuggle together in bed at night and hold each other through hard times.

not that there is anything wrong with that.

it just seems to be queer behavior for a gang of juvenile delinquents.

what?? no, i didn't mean queer like that. no, really, i just meant odd. but, now that you mention it. huh. yeah, it does seem a little queer. who knew that boys in leather could have a queer connotation?? 



and putting on tight t-shirts that show off every muscle before they go to meet the other boys? and making sure to fix their hair?? no, that's just what it says. in the book.

these are their modern-day equivalents

maybe this is just what happens when a teen girl writes this kind of material, tomboy or not. i had seen the movie before, so i knew it was about pretty boys fighting, but there is a lot more at work here, subtextually. i have also seen rumble fish, which is an awful movie based on another hinton book that is even more... musical, but is an excuse to look at this:



and how is tom waits in both movies?

but all of that is just me giggling.

what is more interesting, from a serious literary perspective is just an observation from reading this, the pigman, and revisiting the chocolate war and catcher in the rye for this portion of my young adult readers' advisory class which will meet this tuesday where we will discuss the ""classics"" of teen fiction. (and i know catcher wasn't specifically produced for a teen audience, but it is on the damn syllabus and if it makes you happier, i will call this ""the teen in literature"" instead) 

in the fifties and sixties, there was seemingly more free-floating apprehension and fear: the a-bomb, the draft, various factors contributed to this fear of an imminent death beyond anyone's control. all this anxiety and fear of the establishment created a more pronounced sense of ""us"" and ""them"" that i think i blabbed on a little in the pigman review, but children were just treated like smaller adults, really. and the literature reflects this. all of these books seem to emphasize a value placed on the preservation of childhood innocence - staying gold, protecting a younger sister from the taint of phoniness, encouraging kids to act like kids and roller skate through the house and disregard the parental restrictions in this one safe place... 

now, the boundaries are blurrier - girls are getting their periods at 8, and grown men in suits are playing video games on the subway. the distinctions are less clear. and a lot of teen fiction today is more escapist in nature, less didactic. teens don't need to be told to value their childhood anymore because, don't worry, it will never end. 

peter pan FTW!!

this all means nothing, except it is something i noticed. sorry for blabbing on...

come to my blog!"
1146,Beatriz,Memorias de una geisha,"Mar 18, 2020",5,"Creo que puedo contar con los dedos de las manos los libros que he cerrado con un suspiro de satisfacci√≥n, aquellos con un desenlace que roza lo perfecto y, por supuesto, Memorias de una geisha entra en este selecto grupo de mis lecturas.

Lo que entrega esta novela puedo dividirlo en dos aspectos. Por una parte, un acercamiento magn√≠fico a la cultura e historia del Jap√≥n de la pre y post Guerra a trav√©s de la sufrida vida de una geisha de Gion. El autor nos pasea con crudeza pero tambi√©n con una exquisita delicadeza narrativa por las casas de t√©, las casas de geishas y sus abusivos v√≠nculos econ√≥micos, la educaci√≥n de estas j√≥venes, la superstici√≥n que las envuelve y mucho, mucho m√°s. Me d√≠ cuenta que de este tema no sab√≠a casi nada y lo que sab√≠a... bueno, en su mayor√≠a eran percepciones err√≥neas. Me enter√© tambi√©n que en su momento este libro caus√≥ una fuerte pol√©mica, ya que algunas costumbres no se describ√≠an con la suficiente exactitud, pero al menos en mi caso, eso no le quita valor.

Por otra parte, tenemos la novela propiamente tal, con todos los conflictos que rodean la historia personal de Chiyo/Sayuri, desde sus inocentes 9 a√±os, hasta que logra la paz interior (no me atrevo de calificarlo de felicidad) que tanto necesitaba. Con unos personajes antagonistas tan bien dibujados que los llegas a odiar (Hatsumono, sin quien el libro se reducir√≠a pr√°cticamente a la mitad) y a amar (Nobu, quien me caus√≥ una profunda pena durante toda la lectura).

Una delicia de libro que recomiendo sobradamente.

When Alice had come within a few yards of it, she saw that the thing sitting on the wall had eyes and a nose and mouth and a large pile of golden hair; and when she had come very close, she saw clearly that it was TRUMPTY DUMPTY himself. ""It must be him because that‚Äôs what is written on his baseball cap,"" she said to herself. He was already speaking to her. 

‚ÄúThey said I wouldn‚Äôt build the wall and I built the wall. They were wrong because they weren‚Äôt right. Really really really great wall.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it is,‚Äù said Alice. ‚ÄúWhat is it for?‚Äù
‚ÄúBelieve me, this is the greatest wall there ever was,‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it is,‚Äù said Alice, ‚Äúbut please, what is it for?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe people, there were people, who said the wall would never be built, they were not smart people, as you see, the wall is right here, it is extremely extremely here, believe me.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, I do see that it is, but please,‚Äù said Alice, getting rather impatient, ‚Äúwhat is it for?‚Äù
‚ÄúThose people, there were so many many of them, they said the wall was never ever ever going to be built, that‚Äôs what they said, you can check that, it‚Äôs there in the record. They were really really not smart those people. Everyone here can see that this is a great great day. That is what people are telling me. ‚Äù
‚ÄúBut ‚Äì"" started Alice.
‚ÄúWe are making Wonderland great again. Really really great. Dozens, hundreds of people, have said that there would be no wall. No wall at all. They said it would never never never happen. You can‚Äôt find those people any more because they are on the other side of the wall. Oh yes, there is another side of the wall. Really really other side. Can you hear them?‚Äù
Trumpty put his hand to his ear, exaggeratedly listening. Alice listened hard too for a moment but could not hear a sound, except for Trumpty talking continually. She had by now given up trying to ask Trumpty Dumpty anything at all. It was as if he did not know what a conversation was.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be amazing, really amazing. You will see Wonderland great again. So great.‚Äù

Sorry about that..... I really just wanted to flag up that this Definitive 150th Anniversary edition by Martin Gardner is exquisite and replaces all previous editions. So if you have a birthday coming up, you could ask for this! And if you get it you'll have a smile that will take a really really great long time to fade away. Believe me."
1149,Meghhnaa  (On a Review-Writing Break!),Little Women,"Jul 29, 2022",5,"MY FOREVER DRUG ! 

I prefer sitting all snug and warm with my hot-coffee mug and reading through the adventures of the adorable March family.

March family is like a bower of evergreen prolific climbers (with a never give-up attitude), bearing four idiosyncratic perennial flowers (the March Sisters), each having a distinct fragrance of their own. 

Anyone can be easily beguiled by their charm, I am smitten ! (esp. Jo). Each has idiosyncratic talents and characteristics. Love for the family keeps them bonded.

One can find shelter in this bower anytime to relax and rejuvenate.

Unambiguously, it is saccharine, endearing, professing principles of Christianity, oozing out tons of gratefulness, solidarity, respect and above all heart-touching sisterhood (for someone like me without siblings, March sisters helped me to live this experience virtually!)

Whenever the 4 March Sisters - Jo, Beth, Amy, Meg called out their mother as ""Marmee"", I was engulfed with heart-wrenching emotions. Marmee afterall !

The girls aren't complaint boxes about any resistances in life but steer through all the predicaments with a cheerful disposition and childlike spirit.

The novel begins with the sisters sitting crestfallen, pondering about their circumstances, yet aiming to brighten up their Christmas. Planning to buy gifts for each other, which finally narrows down to buying for their Marmee, this novel is all about sharing and living lovingly.

Mr. Laurence, their neighbor invites the girls for the New Year's Party, where Jo ( my fav. character, afterall she is in love with books) meets Laurie (another fav of mine , high-spirited and mischievous in company of the March sisters) who ends up falling in love with one of the sisters (leaving it to the audience to discover). There is so much more to this novel, can't capture the superfluous information in a small review.

The sisters traverse through various adventures and vicissitudes of life with calmness and dignity. Best part of the plot is that none of the sisters is supercilious.

The novel ends on a happy note, where everyone is busy counting their blessings. 

Warning - This book is infused with a heavy dose of morality."
1150,Mario the lone bookwolf,Animal Farm,"Oct 26, 2022",4,"Communism, theocracy, fascism, capitalism, neocolonialism, neoliberalism, always the same piggy style 

Although it was mainly aimed at Russia and the Sowjet Union
Because they at least tried to establish a socialist communist workers' utopia just like China and other states in South East Asia and around the world. The fact that it always failed is something so multidimensional that it would blow the complexity of this review throughout the book cover. And I¬¥m not qualified too. So let¬¥s better say that each system has its flaws, and that coincidence, big history, and geopolitics influence the rise and fall of theism and totalitarianism.

All animals are the same but some are more equal
Especially apes love this idea to look at fur, gender, religion, political or economic ideology, skin color, tradition, clothes, etc. to find something that differentiates them from others as a legitimation and reason to exterminate them. Or at least first exclude, stigmatize, discriminate, enslave, and then commit genocides on them. Ironically some dictatorships like communism at least didn¬¥t try to kill all black, Jewish, Muslim, Catholic, etc. people, but just everyone who disobeyed, although I¬¥m not sure if this really is an advantage in contrast to fascism. Communism could simply kill so many more people in Russia, China, etc. because they had much more time to do so. So judging by the numbers, one could say

That the kill count counts 
But how should one know which numbers are correct, because often nobody counted or was killed for trying to do so
Colonialism under authoritarian dictatorships aka monarchy fused with theocracy torture terror killed an unknown number of people
Fascism killed at least something between 75 and 100 million people
Communism killed something between 125 and 250 million people
Capitalism, neoliberalism, and neocolonialism killed an unknown number of people in all exploited areas with billions of citizens by not helping them to develop and stabilize. And guess what, I would bet that each avoidable death within the last decades, now, and in the future could reach the levels above. Another Western derision after centuries of colonialism, now rebranded as neocolonialism under the neoliberal economic Nobel Price agenda. Nobody can say how many people are dying after unimaginable suffering each minute and, most disturbing, no media or politician cares or talks about it. It¬¥s just too taboo to touch this connection with a pitchfork because of the implications and because of manufacturing consent crushing everyone who dares to speak out.

Evil intelligence
No matter which farm animal, ape, or human tribe, the clever and ruthless sociopathic males will always try to dominate for more power, resources, sexy ape girls, and influence. All of human history could be seen as a permanent struggle with the megalomania of superpowers which have at least been somewhat tamed by democracy and capitalism. But even there are huge differences between the libertarian free US market and eco social Europe.

Orwell simply later modified the same concept for 1984 or, one could assume, wrote a prequel
1984 is the same with fascism and humans instead of pigs and communism and, of course, also the more famous one because it showed the direct consequences that are normal everyday life for many people around the world. 

No need to enter misantropic mode
There have been incredible improvements in the last 100 years and social evolution has become a peaceful revolution in many states, especially Scandinavia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_... , my all time favorite example of a perfect balance of state and economy, of eco social politics and a controlled market. On the other hand, there are of course also states backlashing and thereby failing in Africa, South America, South East Asia, and the Southern US, but with the never ending hope for enlightenment, education, and distributional justice one can imagine a brighter future for them.

1151,Madeline,The Fault in Our Stars,"Jan 18, 2012",5,"At age twenty-two, John Green worked as a student chaplain in a children's hospital. 

Let's take a moment and consider all the implications of that, and why he is making a colossal understatement when he described the experience as ""devastating."" That was about twelve years ago, and Green has said in interviews that because of this experience, he's spent twelve years trying to write a book about kids with cancer - not poster children of strength and courage and illness-granted wisdom, but real kids and their families and friends who have to cope with the fact that they will die young. 

All novels are personal, but Green's novels seem, to me, to be especially so. But this one is personal in a different way. With this novel, Green isn't trying to exorcize the memory of the girl who stomped on his heart in high school. This goes deeper than high school romance and Manic Pixie Dream Girl angst. This is about life, death, illness, love, heroism, and how a sixteen-year-old is supposed to deal with the fact that she will die and leave everyone she loves behind. Maybe it's just because I've been watching vlogbrothers videos for four years and feel like I'm actually acquainted with John Green, but this is the most deeply personal novel I've ever read. 

This is not, as Hazel Lancaster might say, a Cancer Book. None of the cancer patients in this story have a wisdom beyond their years, and they do not stoically accept the fact that they will die or fight heroically. Hazel Lancaster, a terminal sixteen-year-old who has to carry an oxygen tank everywhere because ""my lungs suck at being lungs"" is refreshingly real - not manic, not a pixie, not a dream girl. She reads Great Books and watches America's Next Top Model marathons. Augustus Waters, her amputee friend, wants desperately to leave a lasting impression on the world and philosophizes about heroism, and his favorite book is a novelization of a video game. (can I say how much I love that an author can establish a character's intelligence without telling us that they love reading Austen yes Stephenie Meyer I'm looking at you) Everything here is real, especially the diseases. There isn't any bullshit about dying gracefully here, because cancer is ugly and unpleasant, and Green makes you feel Hazel's lungs struggling to breathe and the pain, and see the vomit and urine. (Remember how in A Walk to Remember, Mandy Moore has been secretly dying of leukemia the whole time but looks great even on her deathbed? Nicholas Sparks can fuck right off for that insult to real cancer patients) Most importantly, Hazel and Augustus are not defined by their cancer. It consumes their lives, but it doesn't define them. On every page, it's clear: this is a story told by someone who hasn't known just one person with cancer, but has seen a multitude of children with terminal diseases, and has tried to find some way to comfort them and their families. 

It's for that reason that I don't feel like I can review this like a normal book. John Green didn't write this story for me, and so I don't feel like I have any place saying that it's amazing and beautiful and heartbreaking. And I certainly can't criticize any of its minor faults. All I can say, really, is that you have to read this for yourself, and go from there. 

...

Okay, you guys know me better than that. I have one big complaint, which I will describe here, and all I ask is that you remember that I still gave this five stars. 

Augustus Waters, in the first few chapters, comes off as a pretentious douche. When Hazel first meets him at a cancer support group, they're talking afterwards and Augustus takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. Hazel, who you'll recall is dying because her lungs cannot function, freaks out: ""...even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER."" Augustus explains that he doesn't smoke the cigarettes, he just puts them in his mouth (no, really) because ""They don't kill you unless you light them...And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: you put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing."" 

Augustus, I love you, but you're full of shit right there. Notice how he didn't address Hazel's perfectly valid point that, by buying cigarettes, Augustus is giving money to the people who cause cancer? Because here's the thing: you can say to a cigarette company, ""I'm buying your cigarettes as a metaphor, but I won't light them so I'm taking away their power"" and they'll stop listening at ""I'm buying your cigarettes"" because that's all they care about. And it's a shit metaphor in any case: you can walk around a mall with a shotgun and explain to people that because it's unloaded you've taken away its power, but you're still going to get arrested. 

So that was annoying, as was Augustus's general air of overly-charming pretentious skeeziness in the beginning. But I forgive him for it, because lest we forget, he is seventeen. If his character was twenty-two he'd be the most obnoxious jackass on the planet, but because he's just a kid, I was willing to forgive him. Still hate the cigarette thing, though."

1154,Lisa,The Alchemist,"Jun 25, 2014",1,"Homework for ""Introductory Course For Irony Disposal And Sarcasm Removal (ICFIDASR)"", lesson one, re-submission number 47.

I once read a book that inspired me to change my whole attitude towards reading. It was a medicine of universal, cosmic impact. Before, I had thought that books existed to enrich me, giving me knowledge, pleasure and understanding. 

After reading the introductory pages of this ""enchanting novel"" however, I learned that more wisdom can be gained from the companionship of sheep than from books, as stated by the wise young protagonist, a shepherd who uses books for a pillow and sheep for dialogue partners (it is a one-way road, with the sheep as teachers, for the sheep don't learn anything from him). In simple, unsophisticated prose, which seems to be carefully following the rubric of a Grade 6 descriptive writing assignment, I read:

""The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives, and didn't understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and - once in a while - their meat.""

Learning to take everything literally is part of my course, so I try not to see a metaphor in the fact that the boy learns more from sheep than from books. But I do have a question or two:

If the sheep are only his""friends"" as long as he brings them food, do they really count as friends? Are they not just following their needs?

Is it not quite self-evident that they have not read any books in their young lives - they are sheep after all, and won't read in their old age either, I assume?

Do they really ""generously offer their wool, their company, and -ONCE IN A WHILE - their meat? At least as far as the meat is concerned, I am sure they offer it once, and not again, and not by free choice, and generously?

As this book is to be taken seriously, I beg to accept my apology if my questions sound like sarcasm. That is not my intention. I am really just asking ""all universe to conspire to help me achieve my goal"" (another piece of wisdom the book offers) - of understanding how anyone can take this seriously! I just wonder how all universe deals with opposing wishes, which must occasionally occur, even in a small place like our earth. If I for example wish to have my neighbour's garden chair, and my neighbour wishes to keep it, who does ""all universe"" side with, and how does it conspire to help me get it, and at the same time to help my neighbour to keep it?

Things that happen once can never happen again, I also learn. Before I can even ask why, I get another piece of information: Things that happen twice will always happen again. How does that go together? If things have happened once (which is a prerequisite for happening twice in my world) they won't happen again?!? Whatever is meant, things can NEVER happen twice, that is sure. I can't travel to Italy twice. If I do it anyway (which is not possible) I will definitively do it again. That is nice!

When I do travel to Italy (once, or three times), my life and my path will always provide me with enough omens. That is interesting, and I do not know why I all of a sudden associate this with the sheepish followers in Life Of Brian, who found omens in sandals.

Call me literal-minded, but I do have some issues with the idea of omen provision. Can I order them online nowadays? What do they cost? 

To close my reflection on learning more from sheep than books, I have to say: In some cases, that is very true! What a bitter medicine!

As with all medicines, there are some side effects, and it is very important to read the warning before you take this drug:

Please do not read this book if you are in danger of thinking too rationally. 

When you read this Grade 6 essay, be careful to check if you show behaviours that you would define as out of character, as they might be symptoms of acute drivel reading allergy. 

Symptoms include: anger, frustration, ridicule, frowning, nausea, meaningless giggling, dreams about book burning, urge to throw the book in the bin or out the window. Symptoms may vary, but in all cases, it is recommended to suspend reading until the brain is reset in adequate sheep mode again. 

If symptoms do not diminish after enjoying a couple of good, real books, please see your librarian for memory removal surgery or therapy."
1155,Sofia,City of Bones ,"Sep 26, 2020",1,"First of all, who designed that cover? It's traumatizing.

Anyway, here I am (again), finally done with City of Bones. I DNFed it the first time because I was so done with Clary slapping everyone. But I'm back. 

I still hate it, thanks. 


Clary Fray is fifteen years old when she witnesses a murder at a nightclub. (Why would they let kids into a nightclub? Anyway.) The murderer is a boy with eyes ""the color of antifreeze."" His name is Jace Wayland. He's actually a Shadowhunter, or a demon-killer, and the kid he killed was a demon. She's understandably shocked, and is even more scared when she gets a call from her mother telling her to not come home. When she gets back to her apartment, her mother is gone. She's attacked by a demon, and it's revealed that she is, in fact, of Shadowhunter blood. 


I bet you can predict the rest of the plot. It's basically Harry Potter. (I guess there are spoilers in this next paragraph, but it's honestly so predictable that they're hardly spoilers at all.)

- Kid discovers they are special
- Kid's parents were also special
- The bad guy was supposed to be dead but he's actually not; wow, how original
- Special artifacts will stop him 
- ""mundanes"" = ""Muggles"" 


TMI actually stands for Too Many Infodumps, because every time Clary met someone knew, they dumped their whole backstory on her and gave us a mini history lesson of the Shadowhunters. There was literally an entire chapter towards the end that was just Luke's backstory. 


Clary has a friend named Simon who is absolutely insufferable. Everything he says is sarcastic. He can't take anything seriously. He ""loves"" Clary. (Come on. We all know the childhood best friends never win in a love triangle. Can we just cut this?) He's been ""in love"" with Clary for ""ten years."" (He was five ten years ago.) Why is he hanging out with the Shadowhunters anyway? He has no purpose. There's no point to him being there. His only job is to turn into a rat halfway through. We waste like five chapters trying to save him from being a rat. It was so boring and I didn't care at all.


""Ignore him,"" Clary said to Jace, and elbowed Simon in the side. ""He always says exactly what comes into his head. No filters.""



""Sarcasm is the last refuge of the imaginatively bankrupt,"" she told him.
 

These kids are fifteen and yet they're going to nightclubs and talking like they're twenty. All of the banter felt out of place. 


""'Here' as in your bedroom or 'here' as in the great spiritual question of our purpose here on this planet? If you're asking whether it's all just a cosmic coincidence or there's a greater meta-ethical purpose to life, well, that's a puzzler for the ages. I mean, simple ontological reductionism is clearly a fallacious argument, but-""


Jace is flexing.


Clary is equally annoying. She slaps everyone for no reason and it's supposed to make her ""strong."" (It actually just makes her a jerk.) She doesn't know she's beautiful (and that's what makes her beautiful). She is not like other girls.


Two teenage girls sitting on an orange bench seat were giggling together. The sort of girls Clary had never liked at St. Xavier's, sporting pink jelly mules and fake tans.



She'd never understood why some girls felt the need to smell like dessert.


She ugly-shames people, despite calling herself less than beautiful on many occasions. 


Clary wondered if there were any ugly vampires, or maybe any fat ones. Maybe they didn't make vampires out of ugly people. Or maybe ugly people didn't want to live forever.



Jace likes to call Clary ""little girl,"" despite the fact that they are basically the same age. Can we stop with the condescension? Also, he smells gross:


She was standing so close that she could smell the scent of him, sweat and soap and blood.


Get you a man who smells like sweat and blood all the time.

Jace is not like other guys:


""You may be the only guy my age I've ever met who knows what bergamot is, much less that it's in Earl Grey tea.""
""Yes, well,"" Jace said, with a supercilious look. ""I'm not like other guys.""


*intense coughing* 

Only Dorothea knows the truth about Jace's awful sense of humor.


""If you were half as funny as you thought you were, my boy, you'd be twice as funny as you are.""



And I can't tolerate characters who treat those without powers like they're lesser. Throughout the book, Jace ridiculed Simon and treated him like he was nothing. There's a saying that you should always judge a person by how they treat people in positions of less power, and Jace isn't looking too good. 


Jace leaned forward and banged his hand against the partition separating them from the cab driver. ""Turn left! Left! I said to take Broadway, you brain-dead moron!""


What a jerk. 


There were some racist incidences that struck me the wrong way, like when Jace met someone Mexican and kept calling him ""chico."" 


The writing was okay, but there was far too much description. If the unnecessary bits were cut out, the book would be half as long as it is now. 
And there are some... interesting analogies. Like the antifreeze, and like this:


...Jace reminded him, his voice soft as cat's fur.


Some of the description wasn't even good.


The apple tasted green and cool.


*shook* 

Also, there was a lot of all-caps screaming, which was extremely juvenile.


""NO POINT?"" Clary shouted, so loudly that Simon hid his head under her thumb. ""HOW CAN YOU SAY THERE'S NO POINT?""
 


The magic system was odd. There's this thing called a stele, which is used to draw runes that can heal a Shadowhunter. But it's literally just used whenever the Shadowhunters don't know what to do. There's no definite limit to what it can do. 


Besides, there were plot holes. Why did Valentine team with demons if the only reason he was evil in the first place is because he said Downworlders were too demonic to live?


The only good character was Jocelyn because of this: 


Jocelyn recognized reading as a sacred pastime and usually wouldn't interrupt Clary in the middle of a book, even to yell at her.


*applause*

Also, there were grammar and spelling mistakes and inconsistencies. Is Shadowhunter actually Shadow-hunter? Because there were different ways of spelling it and I'm confused. 

Oh and there was this quote, which made me laugh out loud. (For context, Simon just asked if Isabelle and Jace were dating.) 


""Ew, no. They're practically related. They wouldn't do that.""


If you know, you know.
*muffled wheezing*

Yes, I am giving this another try.
Why? 
Because I still haven't figured out who Magnus Bane is and I feel like he's someone I need to know.

First Read; DNF; 0.5 stars

There's a difference between good trash and bad trash. 

On one hand, we have the guilty pleasures, which I usually devour in less than a day. You all know the formula - evil guy trying to take over the world, sarcastic teenage girl who is prophesied to stop him, and a sappy love interest to tie it all off. Let's not forget about the comic relief. 

This is my excuse to rate some trash four stars and some trash one star. It's such a fine line and so easy to cross. I can read a formulaic novel and thoroughly enjoy it (because I'm no literary critic), and I can read a different derivative book and want to throw it in the trash where it belongs.

I think you can guess which category City of Bones falls into. 

This is the epitome of bad trash. We have Clary, the most annoying, rude, ungrateful girl in the history of annoying, rude, ungrateful girls. She snaps at everyone. She literally runs away to a poetry competition because her mother wants to take her on vacation. Either she has some problems or she's just a ReBeLlIoUs TeEnAgEr, because ALL of us can relate to THAT. 



And then we have Simon, who can only speak sarcastically. No, really. Nothing he says is serious. Everything is a complete joke, and it's not funny at all. 

And finally, there's Jace, who I want to throw in the trash along with this book. There is absolutely nothing special about him. He makes bad jokes. He's a ""Shadowhunter"" *cringes at the cheese* He fights dEmOnS. Yippee. At one point, Clary gets all overwhelmed with how SPESHUL Jace is because he knows what bergamot is. And then he says - I KID YOU NOT - ""I'm not like other guys."" HE SAID IT. HE ACTUALLY SAID IT.

Oh, wait! Let's not forget the plot! Which is so horrible I want to cry. 

Apparently, there's this Shadowhunter who betrayed his fellow demon-murderers and went to the Dark Side. Does that sound familiar to you? Oh, really! I totally didn't pick up on this book's resemblance to Star Wars! 

And his name is... drum roll please...

Valentine. 

If you're going to make a villain, give him a cool name! Now I can't picture him wearing anything but pink suspenders with hearts on them. Everyone's like ""oooo, Valentine is so scary -"" NO. HE IS NOT. He is a CUPID. 



We also have a mentor figure who is such a caricature that my brain is exploding trying to comprehend the cheese. I forgot his name. 

No, I won't be continuing the series. To everyone's complete and utter shock, I'm not too big on incest."
1156,carol.,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Apr 28, 2011",5,"Review of the audio, read by Stephen Fry:

Overall, Fry earns a solid 'B+' for his rendition of the classic Hitchhiker's Guide. Fry has the perfect 'narrator' voice, and I generally enjoyed most of his character voices. Ford Prefect often has a rakish tone, his reading of Arthur Dent is note-perfect clueless, and Zaphod Beeblebrox has a deliciously smarmy confidence. It was a bit of a revelation to find Marvin more amusing in audio than when I read the book, although I feel like Fry might have given him a tad too much despondent enthusiasm. His reading of the Vogon gibberish as the Babel fish was inserted and translated it into English had me laughing.

No, my biggest problem is that I think sometimes Fry got a little too involved in the story, and his character voices bled together. He'd suddenly remember who was speaking, and pull Zaphod out of dashing Ford territory and back into cocky confidence, but it was often enough and in dialogue enough that I definitely noticed as a trend, not an instance. 

Well, no matter; still utterly engaging. There was a distracting formatting issue where the pause between chapters must have been edited out between the end of the previous chapter, Fry reading the chapter heading (ex. ""Chapter Five"") and the continuation of the story, there was no pause at all.

Though Audible claims this is unabridged, I either spaced out a few moments (entirely possible) or it isn't, quite. I'll have to give it another listen-through as I'm driving. But I'm definitely enthusiastic about moving on to The Restaurant at the End of the Universe if Fry is reading."
1157,emma,Pride and Prejudice,"May 17, 2019",5,"I am so unqualified to write about this book.

I am physically unqualified, because I could write infinite words about how much I love this book, and I type in a weird way that makes my wrists hurt so infinity is simply not going to happen.

I am emotionally unqualified, because I lack emotional intelligence when it comes to my own feelings and the idea of trying to explain how I feel about this book is overwhelming.

I am spiritually unqualified, because of the aforementioned overwhelmed-ness.

I am also unqualified generally, in the grand scheme of things, because so many people have written so intelligently about the wonderfulness of this book and I have nothing better to add.

Just more rambling like this.

I read a lot of romance, and if you want to venture a theory as to why, I‚Äôd love to hear it. I very seldom like it, so maybe it‚Äôs a masochist tendency. Maybe I‚Äôm a glutton for the attention that writing negative reviews of popular books gives me. (Definitely not that one, since the few mean comments always outweigh the far more numerous nice ones in my stupid brain.) Whatever.

I read a lot of romance, but I almost never feel anything about it.

I LOVE this book. It gives me...uh‚Ä¶(everyone stop reading this to save me the embarrassment and allow me to preserve my rough and tumble reputation)...butterflies.

I know. I‚Äôm cringing forever. But it‚Äôs true. 

This is a lovely book. It‚Äôs beautifully written, it‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs filled with characters who feel full and real and different from one another (even though half of them have the same name), and it truly is the best love story ever told.

What more could you ask for?! Spoiled rotten, the lot of you.

Bottom line: A dream.

1158,Anne,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Mar 05, 2018",5,"Anybody else read it with this cover?



I did. 1986, I was in 6th grade, and it was assigned to us by our teacher. 
This book changed my world. Or at least, my reading world. 
Welcome to sci-fi, kid!
I have no idea how many times I've read this story, but as a child, I read it so much that this awesome cover eventually fell off. Just so many great memories of these characters make it is easily my favorite childhood novel.

After doing a re-read of it this year, I have to say it holds up pretty well for a book that was written in 1962. One of the things that help it age so decently is that L'Engle didn't have much in it that could age it. No brand names, no popular trends, no references to any politics of the day. The only stuff that really let you know you were reading a book written in the '60s was Calvin saying things like Golly! unironically or Charles Wallace being disrespectful by calling his father Pops.

It's a very simple story that I read in just under 2 hours, but I remember it being complex enough when I was younger. I think it hits all the right points for a kid who feels out of place and weird, and didn't we all feel out of place and weird at that age?
Yes. Yes, we did.

The only thing I was less excited about this time around were all the religious references, but the book is what it is, and you just kind of have to accept that God is a big theme in this and move on if you want to enjoy it. It's not too preachy, so there's that.

Will kids today like it? I'm trying to get mine to read it now, so ask me again in 6 months.

But I'd been putting off re-reading this thing for 20 plus years and was pleasantly surprised that it was still such a charming story.
Highly Recommended...for nostalgia."
1159,Tharindu Dissanayake,Gone With the Wind,"Aug 07, 2023",5,"Wait.. what? ‚ÄúThe End‚Äù? Just like that after a 1000+ pages with little closure on so many things? Whatever happened to the good old closure?

That was one of the most emotional endings I‚Äôve ever come across, bringing an end to what has been a phenomenal story in more ways that I can express.

But how to review it‚Ä¶ 
Of course, no better way than Scarlett‚Äôs signature move for everything:


‚ÄùI‚Äôll think of it all tomorrow. I can stand it then. After all, tomorrow is another day.‚Äù"

This is magical book, when I get into my hands for the first time, I was only eleven and for decades I kept on getting it into my hands, reread it several times and same words resonated different for me, awoke different feelings, made me look at the characters‚Äô flaws and differences at brand new perspective.
Even though I know the ending: I laughed, I cried, I sighed, I smiled, I jumped, I felt peaceful and at the end I LOVED IT TRULY, DEEPLY so MUCH! Christmas is coming. You think there won‚Äôt be Christmas without presents and I think there won‚Äôt be any meaningful celebration without doing my yearly reading of this book and reconnecting with Holly March Sisterhood.

1163,karen,Ender's Game ,"Oct 15, 2010",4,"ender's game is pretty awesome, when it's not being boring.

and of course it is just me - in class yesterday the parts i mentioned as being boring TO ME were other people's favorite parts. and this is all due to a design flaw in me: i am physically incapable of visualizing action sequences. in movies, they make it so easy. in books, i frequently have to reread scenes a few times before i can orient myself. throw in zero gravity and weapons that don't actually exist, and i am loster than lost.

but - the parts of this that are good (to me) were very very good. why have i never read this before?? because i thought it was a total little boy book - all outer space and video games. and it is. but it is also about the formative years of a military savant - pushed nearly beyond his endurance into this pit of loneliness and pure strategy and honed into a killing machine. usually i hate precocity, but this was just brilliant. i liked so many of the characters, i loved watching ender progress, i just loved every minute of it. and even the parts i couldn't wrap dumbhead around, they were still fast-paced, even though i couldn't understand ""wait, so who is hiding behind the star?? and who has been flashed? and what does that cord attach to??""

and of course, all that it has to say about the role of ethics on the military and about the suppression of the individual in these circumstances is gorgeous.

1164,Sofia,The Lightning Thief ,"May 01, 2020",5,"Chapter One: I Accidentally Vaporize the Person who Tried to Take this Book Away from Me

 Look, I didn't want to be obsessed. 
 If you're reading this because you think you're only going to read The Lightning Thief once, my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about binge-reading, and try to be a normal person.
 Being obsessed with this book is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed because you want to read it just one more time.
 If you're a normal kid, reading this book because you were forced to, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe you're immune to being obsessed. 
 But if you recognize yourself in these pages - if you feel something stirring inside - stop reading immediately. You might be becoming a member of the Percy Party. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before you read it again. And again. And again.
 Don't say I didn't warn you."
1165,Anne,Fahrenheit 451,"Jul 05, 2020",3,"Oh, come on! 
Who doesn't like to set shit on fire?!



But seriously. 
Don't burn books. <-- that's wasteful!



Or witches. <--that's murder
Or buildings. <--that's arson
Or blue jeans. <--that's...what? no. seriously. back when I was a teenager, I remember this wacky church youth group burning all their jeans because Jesus wanted the girls to wear dresses.

You can however burn calories.



Alight, as much as I love Richard Simmons, I'm veering away from the point.
There are some books that anyone who loves to read feels like they need to get around to. And Fahrenheit 451 is one of those bucket list books that I've been meaning to tick off for years now. 
 And now I'm done. Ta-da!
So what does that mean? Did this book change my life?! 
Short answer is no.
This is a really weird little story with an even weirder ending. <--not BAD, just weird.
Ok. Maybe it is a teensy bit bad in spots. But I think this has the same problem (for me) that most of these older dystopian novels have, in that it depicts humans as just absolutely stupid and prone to easily giving up real relationships. I think that's just dumb.
People crave people.
Now, I'm not saying that there aren't some people who get sucked into too much fake digital shit in whatever form it may take for them - porn, gaming, social media sites, and whatever else. 
BUT. There have always been folks that just retreat from the real world.
Think about those weird hermits who live in some creepy cabin in the woods because they just can't deal with life and think other humans aren't a necessity.



I'm not referring to introverts or folks who are shy, because even if it's hard for them to be in crowds or to act like a social butterfly, they usually have a small group of trusted loved ones.
Point is, this book made it seem as though once people stopped reading and (basically) started watching tv they just ignored everything and everyone.



That just doesn't track. 
And I say this as someone who absolutely loves books, but stories are stories.
Whether you hold a hardback, scroll through an ebook, love the visuals of comics, enjoy listening to audiobooks, or even (gasp!) watch a movie.

 

All of those? They're a medium that allows you to escape. 
Allows you to reach out and live another life, see things through someone else's eyes, and maybe expand your mind.
Don't be a snob. There's room for it all.
And when you actually take a look at how most people watch television shows or movies, we tend to do it in a social way. I watch certain things so that I can talk to my friends about it later, or I pop some popcorn and con one of my kids to sit on the couch with me and watch something stupid together. 

 

I'm not saying you'll be totally fine if you immerse yourself in some sort of virtual world and forget to bathe.
And I'm certainly not saying that we'll be ok if we start lighting books on fire.
What I am saying is that I thought a lot of this particular story was a product of the fears of the time.
TV will rot your brain!
And there may be the slight potential that you could be letting evil spirits into your home if you sit too close to it.



However, there are some things to take away from it that I think are important and potentially relevant still. 
Censorship of any kind, written or otherwise, is dangerous.



You may hate what someone says, you may hate what they stand for, you may think their ideas are vile, but it's so very important to remind yourself that if you try to squash their ability to express those ideas with speech, you're own right to express your ideology and opinions will be the next to go. You also may want to remember that just because you've stopped someone from saying something, doesn't mean they don't still think it. And that shit will fester like a boil.
It will eventually come to a head in a very ugly way because that's how human nature works and no amount of shushing and pretending will stop it. 
I would rather be awkwardly uncomfortable because someone I disagree with has a platform than watch the eruption that will happen when the entire world ignites from one side of an argument that was silenced for too long.
Dude, everyone knows that's when the machines will take over!



Ok, about that ending.
I felt the spirit of Fonzie beside them as Guy & that odd little group of hobos jumped that shark on those train tracks. Am I alone or did anyone else think that whole thing was mighty random?



You've got sleepers hidden all over who've memorized books? What? You've 'figured out' how to unlock the magic photographic memory gene?
Ok. Sure.
Why not?



I also felt like that the killer robot dog was kind of a waste of an incredible idea. It started off like it was going to be super scary and play a huge part in the story and then...yeah, a little bit at the end. But it was kind of anticlimactic. <--to me
I guess I just expected more?



At the end of the day, I'm really glad I finally got around to this. It's definitely required reading, but on the upside, it's pretty short.
AND it's not as depressing as 1984, so there's that.

 The Chronicles of Narnia  will forever have an especial place in my heart. Narnia is a magical place that feels me with warmth and dreams, hope and wishes. Just thinking about it brings a smile to my face.

  ""Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia.""   

I haven't read these books in many years and, in a way, it felt like rediscovering and meeting the world for the first time. It was like coming back home after a long while traveling, comforting and comfortable. But it also brought a new sight to my eyes respecting them.

I love how the story-telling employed by Lewis how it was very simple, yet you could always picture everything perfectly. Though sometimes it became a little too specific in areas that would have done well with just a quick mention. This I especially found in  Prince Caspian  and  The Voyage of the Dawn Treader  where descriptions could go on for forever. Still, most of the time, the narrative is engrossing and simple and fast.

Of course, we can't forget the beautiful characters! I love them so much, especially Edmund!!! I would get so excited whenever a mention of any of the Pevensies came out. I love them so much (except Susan) I can't even.

  ‚ÄúIt is very true,‚Äù said Edmund. ‚ÄúBut even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did.‚Äù  

What else can I say? Let me see... Oh, yeah! I can talk about my favorite book.

Surprisingly enough -at least for me- it turns out that that place is occupied by  The Horse and His Boy,  something I was NOT expecting at all. I think it has something to do with the fact that it fills, a little, that big, empty space where I wish there was a novel about the golden age of Narnia. 

Of course, that's just a part of it. The book really captured me in its own right and can safely say I love it. 

 The Horse and His Boy  is closely followed by  The Last Battle  and  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,  obviously.

  ""All get what they want; they do not always like it.""  

I may add that this collection also has a bit of extra information, right at the end, that added that perfect touch. And helped filled any voids or questions I had respecting the history, timeline, or creatures of Narnia. Really appreciated.

So a funny story with this one:

It appeared on my currently-reading shelf, though I was most certainly NOT reading it. Here is what happened.

My brother and I share the kindle account, which apparently is connected to my Goodreads account - who knew? - so when he opened it to check it out, it immediately updated. Ugh, so frustrating, especially since it's not the first time it happens.

I am planning to read it soon though!"
1167,"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies",The Hunger Games ,"Nov 23, 2015",5,"I was forced into watching Mockingjay: Part II this weekend. To clarify, I watched the second part of the last Hunger Games movie without having read any of the books, without having watched any of the movies.

Needless to say, I was confused as fuck.

So many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as I watched the movie. Why is Peeta so thin? Did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day? Is Katniss supposed to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment, or is that just Jennifer Lawrence? Woody Harrelson is in this movie? Hey, it's Margaery from Game of Thrones! Who's President Snow? What's a Mockingjay? Lesser Hemsworth is pretty hot.

Well, you get the point. I know how the book ended and I still have no idea who anyone is, and neither do I know their names, with the exception of Peeta, Gale, President Snow, that Coin woman, and Katniss. Of course, knowing how the book ended means I probably should read the first book, so here I am, the last person on earth to read The Hunger Games.

And it was good. It was really good. My sister was right (she usually is).

What else can I say that hasn't already been said? I loved it. The world building was interesting (although it helps that I've seen what it looks like on the big screen), and Katniss is awesome. One of the things my sister didn't like about the first movie is that the on-screen Katniss was different from her portrayal in the first book. I haven't watched that movie, but I kind of see how the screen portrayal of Katniss might have bothered her. Book-Katniss is strong, kick-ass without being a Mary Sue. She has a fierce love for her sister, and she is manipulative and cunning. She uses the prospect of romance to protect herself, she has no qualms about using people, and I love that about her.

Time to watch Movie #1!"

1169,Steven Medina,El principito,"Dec 08, 2020",1,"Uno de los peores libros que he le√≠do en mi vida, experiencia desastrosa.

Calificaci√≥n real: 0

El principito, al igual que otros libros de la misma tem√°tica que buscan ayudarnos a conectarnos con nuestro ni√±o interior, es una de esas obras que se recomiendan leer en nuestra infancia pero sobretodo en nuestra adultez. Cuando somos ni√±os no tenemos responsabilidades, jugamos todo el tiempo y nos la pasamos descubriendo el mundo que nos rodea ‚Äîo por lo menos si hemos tenido la fortuna de vivir una buena infancia‚Äî; pero, cuando nos convertimos en adultos y nos acostumbramos a ese tipo de vida, tarde que temprano llegar√° el momento en que nos sentiremos atrapados en la cotidianidad, estresados por los millones de problemas que se presentan diariamente, y angustiados por lo que puede deparar nuestro futuro. Y claro, si estamos en ese estado de lamentaci√≥n, libros como El principito ‚Äîal igual que los libros de autoayuda‚Äî aparecen como la cura milagrosa de nuestros problemas y de la infelicidad que sentimos d√≠a tras d√≠a. Y no es que eso sea negativo, al contrario, independientemente de si nos gusta, o no leer, los libros son nuestros amigos. Si uno de ellos te ayuda a sentir paz interior o felicidad significar√° que ese libro es apropiado para ti, sin importar su calidad. Personalmente, pienso que esa ha sido la raz√≥n para que El principito tuviera el √©xito y la popularidad de la que ha gozado a lo largo de los a√±os: La infelicidad de sus lectores. Sin embargo, si somos neutrales y calificamos este libro por su calidad y no por nuestra emotividad, entenderemos que verdaderamente El principito es un libro p√©simo en todo el sentido de la palabra. 

Mi experiencia con este libro comenz√≥ a los nueve a√±os cuando cursaba quinto de primaria. Era el mes de junio y como todo ni√±o ansiaba la llegada de las vacaciones de mitad de a√±o para no tener que madrugar por algunos d√≠as. Y s√≠, claro que llegaron las vacaciones, pero lo hicieron en compa√±√≠a de varios trabajos largos y tediosos que deb√≠a entregar una vez regresara a clases. Uno de esos trabajos constaba en leer El principito y realizar un resumen de cuatro p√°ginas en hojas tama√±o carta: Parec√≠a un trabajo f√°cil. No obstante, mi dolor de cabeza comenz√≥, cuando termin√© de leerlo y me percat√© de que no hab√≠a entendido absolutamente nada, a pesar de que era un buen estudiante y entend√≠a r√°pidamente cualquier tema. Me sent√≠ desesperado porque ya no dispon√≠a de tiempo de releerlo, pero, afortunadamente mis hermanos me vieron en apuros y me ayudaron a resolver mi problema... de hecho, ellos me hicieron la tarea. D√≠as despu√©s, recib√≠ una buena nota por ¬´mi¬ª trabajo pero internamente me sent√≠ mediocre por no ser capaz de hacer esa tarea. Pas√≥ el tiempo y olvid√© el tema, pero, en lo m√°s profundo de mi subconsciente sobrevivi√≥ el sentimiento de fracaso. Por ello, en el mes de diciembre cuando misteriosamente una polilla entr√≥ revoloteando en mi habitaci√≥n y se pos√≥ en el libro de El principito, sent√≠ que era tiempo de la revancha: Hab√≠a sido una se√±al del destino. Dicen que todo tiene su tiempo y este libro es la clara demostraci√≥n de esa afirmaci√≥n porque tuvieron que pasar dieciocho a√±os y una polilla para reencontrarme con uno de los karmas de mi infancia. M√°s sin embargo, lo que no esperaba era que en esta ocasi√≥n, otra experiencia negativa me estuviera esperando entre las p√°ginas de El principito. 
 
Empezando por el argumento, este libro nos cuenta la historia de un aviador quien afirma haber conocido al principito luego de sufrir un accidente a√©reo en el desierto del Sahara. All√≠, el principito le cuenta la historia de su viaje por muchos planetas, y luego cuando llega el momento dado, el principito regresa a su planeta de origen para cuidar a su mejor amiga que es una rosa... y esa es toda la historia, no hay m√°s. Los cuentos de fantas√≠a muchas veces son as√≠ como El principito: Sin l√≥gica, sin reglas y sin profundidad. No obstante, una de las caracter√≠sticas m√°s destacadas de ese tipo de libros es la magia que est√° oculta en sus palabras. Desafortunadamente, esa magia nunca la sent√≠ en este libro. Ahora, pensar√°n que ya me convert√≠ en adulto y que por ello no puedo entender el significado del libro, pero no, eso no es as√≠. Si no estuviera conectado con mi ni√±o interior no ser√≠a capaz de escribir ni un p√°rrafo al hacer rese√±as. Mi mente adulta est√° cargada de compromisos, apariencias, problemas, l√≥gica, razonamiento, etc., pero ese ni√±o interior es quien tiene la chispa de la creatividad, de la imaginaci√≥n, de relacionar dos temas sin sentido como por ejemplo una cuchara y el planeta j√∫piter. Es el alma que me da la energ√≠a y la curiosidad, y gracias a √©l me siento vivo. Por ello, ese peque√±o Jes√∫s Steven que llevo adentro, es el que me ha indicado que este libro no tiene magia por ninguna parte. Asimismo, es un texto que est√° atiborrado de di√°logos absurdos y de mensajes err√≥neamente expresados que buscan hacernos reflexionar forzosamente. La prosa tiene errores gramaticales, frases mal construidas y todo el libro est√° compuesto de un ca√≥tico desorden. S√© que hay millones de seguidores de esta obra y que para muchos este es su libro favorito, pero para m√≠, sinceramente, lo mejor que tiene esta obra son sus ilustraciones. Esto no es un libro, es un boceto. Estoy seguro que Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry fue mil veces mejor aviador que escritor.

Eso s√≠, aclaro que no estoy en contra de las historias donde un ni√±o aparece m√°gicamente para dar mensajes y ense√±anzas. No lo estoy, porque uno de mis libros favoritos tiene un 90% de similitud con El principito: Ese libro se llama Ami, el ni√±o de las estrellas. De hecho, conoc√≠ aquel libro primero que El principito, y aunque reconozco que es una copia del popular libro de Saint-Exup√©ry, siento que aquella obra de Enrique Barrios ofrece una mejor ense√±anza. Esa ense√±anza se llama amor. Lo que me parece injusto es que Ami, el ni√±o de las estrellas, sea criticado fuertemente por el intento del autor de influenciar a los ni√±os en la religi√≥n ‚Äîafirmaci√≥n que no comparto‚Äî, pero, de El principito no se menciona nada de ello. Si los libros de autoayuda, los textos religiosos y los libros con alg√∫n fin pol√≠tico son cuestionados por la manipulaci√≥n del autor, entonces El principito tambi√©n deber√≠a ser juzgado del mismo modo porque todo el texto est√° plagado de ese tipo de ideas. La domesticaci√≥n; su intento de hacer sentir mal a las personas que no les gusta este libro; la idolatr√≠a representada en la forma como el aviador ve√≠a al principito; el uso del fracaso como medio para identificarnos con el aviador; pero sobretodo, el desagrado u odio que sent√≠a Saint-Exup√©ry hacia la vida adulta, son solo peque√±as muestras de su intento por influenciar a los lectores para que no se adapten a una sociedad. A Saint-Exup√©ry no le interesaba que los lectores lucharan por sus sue√±os, su verdadera intenci√≥n es que las personas estuvieran en contra de la sociedad porque la odiaba, es muy notable. Este libro solo es un mensaje de odio disfrazado de inocencia, amor, amistad, ternura y belleza. Solo es un libro m√°s que busca alterar la forma como el lector piensa. ¬øPor qu√© tantos lo aclaman y no se dan cuenta de algo tan obvio? No lo entiendo. 

Tampoco sent√≠ simpat√≠a por los personajes. El principito solo me pareci√≥ un ni√±o ingenuo y pregunt√≥n que no entiende nada de la vida, pero que s√≠ se atreve a cuestionar y juzgar el comportamiento de los hombres, sin conocerlos. Esa situaci√≥n se asemejar√≠a por ejemplo, si viaj√°ramos a un pa√≠s con una cultura muy diferente a la nuestra, y al llegar empez√°ramos a juzgar y criticar a los habitantes del lugar por sus comportamientos, creencias y vestimenta: Ser√≠a il√≥gico juzgarlos. S√≠, podr√≠amos opinar, pero solo conociendo las razones que han llevado a esos seres a vivir la vida que poseen. El principito puede venir de Mercurio, de Plut√≥n o de la constelaci√≥n de Andr√≥meda, pero √©l, no es nadie para venir a criticar a seres que no conoce. Viv√≠a con una rosa y se hart√≥ de ella, no es una sorpresa que al llegar a otros mundos se comportara de la misma manera. Sin embargo, podr√≠a decirse que al fin y al cabo el principito es un ni√±o y que es normal su imprudencia y tendencia a equivocarse; pero, el que no tiene excusa es el aviador: √âl es el culpable de todo. El aviador encontr√≥ un ni√±o en un desierto y solo porque √©l ten√≠a imaginaci√≥n, result√≥ idolatr√°ndolo como un dios: Il√≥gico, completamente il√≥gico. Todo lo que dijo el principito al aviador le pareci√≥ espectacular, m√°gico y sabio; tanto as√≠, que para el aviador se convirti√≥ en una necesidad estar cerca de √©l. Yo, creer√≠a, que perderse en un desierto y estar en riesgo de muerte, puede alterar nuestra mente por lo que esa ser√≠a la explicaci√≥n al comportamiento inusual del aviador. Para m√≠, el aviador perdi√≥ la cordura. El principito solo era un ni√±o com√∫n y corriente, sin ninguna habilidad extraordinaria. Quiz√°s nunca existi√≥, quiz√°s solo fue producto de la imaginaci√≥n del aviador. Si eso fuera as√≠, eso lo explicar√≠a todo. 

Vi√©ndolo de este modo, y teorizando un poco, podr√≠a decirse que si se toma El principito como la historia de un demente, entonces este libro s√≠ ser√≠a una genialidad. La mala redacci√≥n, las frases sin sentido y la historia absurda, solo as√≠ tendr√≠an sentido. ¬øQu√© fue lo que realmente Saint-Exup√©ry escribi√≥? ¬øHemos estado malinterpretando todo este tiempo esta historia? Para averiguarlo tendr√≠amos que regresar en el tiempo y pregunt√°rselo en persona a Saint-Exup√©ry, no hay otra forma; por lo tanto, que cada quien crea lo que desee pensar porque no podemos resolver esas preguntas. Sin embargo, esta extra√±a posibilidad podr√≠a convertir este libro en una gran iron√≠a. ¬øPor qu√©? Porque durante varias generaciones este es uno de nuestros primeros libros de la infancia. ¬øHemos le√≠do un libro para ni√±os, o la oscura historia de un demente? No quiero persuadir a nadie con esta idea; de hecho, ni siquiera yo creo en ello, pero es una posibilidad que se me ocurri√≥ en el mism√≠simo instante en que escrib√≠ el p√°rrafo anterior y me pareci√≥ interesante compartirla con todos ustedes. 

En resumen, El principito es un libro que est√° orientado para las personas que no est√°n acostumbradas a leer, pero que buscan encontrar en un texto el camino que sienten que han perdido. Si ya se tiene experiencia leyendo, o no estamos desesperados por la infelicidad, es mejor no leer este libro. Puede ser un cl√°sico, pero personalmente siento que no deber√≠a serlo por la pobre calidad de la que est√° compuesto. Asimismo, si leyeron este libro hace mucho tiempo y tienen una imagen positiva del principito, puede que cuando lo relean cambie la perspectiva y sensaciones que tuvieron en su primera lectura; a menos, que este libro los haya ayudado en sus momentos dif√≠ciles. De ser as√≠, a pesar de releerlo mil veces, El principito siempre ser√° un gran amigo para ustedes. 

Ahora, bas√°ndome en mis dos lecturas y las experiencias desastrosas que he vivenciado, siento que no hay raz√≥n para volver a leer este libro nunca m√°s. Cuando reci√©n finalic√© mi segunda lectura, planeaba puntuarlo con dos estrellas, pero ahora que lo pienso eso no es justo. Hay libros que he calificado con esa puntuaci√≥n pero por lo menos tienen virtudes para destacar. No puedo puntuar con dos estrellas un libro donde lo m√°s destacado son sus ilustraciones: Ser√≠a un desatino hacerlo. Por lo tanto, mi calificaci√≥n es de 0 estrellas."

I have a confession to make. 

*
*

I have never read Harry Potter. 



Yes, yes, I know...this is akin to reader sacrilege.

But I just had no interest in these books when they came out. I was too busy reading about men in kilts fucking the milkmaid. 

Therefore, my only experience with ""Hermione"" is the SNL skit where Lindsey Lohan shows Harry and that other scarfed dude her ginormous tatas. 

  

Well, what with everyone going ape shit over the newest installment, I figure I should probably find out what all this Hogwart's business is about. 

And since my friend's 9 year old demanded that I read his copy, I now have the paperback in my possession. 

Hoping to get starting this week..."
1173,may ‚ûπ,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Jan 19, 2018",2,"I had a much longer review written for this book, but the comments were sadly annoying me. so I‚Äôll just make my opinions clear in two sentences, because these are really the only thoughts about the book that matter to me:

I was extremely bored by the majority of this novel and thus I did not enjoy it very much (and no, I will not reread it because I do not care). most importantly, though, I don‚Äôt believe a white savior narrative like this one is a story that should be so heavily defended by white people or pushed as an essential book in school curriculum today when there are better books about racism by people who have actually experienced it, and especially when this book cares more about the white characters than the Black ones!"
1174,Jesse (JesseTheReader),Nineteen Eighty-Four,"Dec 15, 2018",0,"This was an up and down kind of read for me. There were parts that I really enjoyed and parts that I found extremely difficult to maneuver through. I'm glad that I decided to pick it up and give it a go, because it's one that I've been curious about for a long time. I can definitely see why so many people love this book. It explores a lot of things that we see happening in the world today. I can't say I'm leaving it as a massive fan, but I'm sure it's one that I'll continue to think about."
1175,Joe Valdez,Of Mice and Men,"May 20, 2014",5,"What more can I possibly add to a discussion of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men without drawing a high school English teacher's salary? Considering I'm not drawing bored glances from teenagers, I doubt that a check from LAUSD will appear in my mailbox anytime soon. 

-- Published in 1937, this is the work that the Goodreads algorithms seem to have agreed is the author's most renowned. For Stephen King, it's The Shining, for Elmore Leonard it's Get Shorty and for John Steinbeck it's Of Mice and Men. 

-- This is a novella, approximate length 34,720 words. I read it in under forty-eight hours.

-- The story revolves around two ranch hands traveling the highways and ranches of California, looking out for each other and trying to build enough of a stake to put down on their own piece of land. 

Both were dressed in denim trousers and in denim coats with brass buttons. Both wore black, shapeless hats and both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders. The first man was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp, strong features. Every part of him was defined: small, strong hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose. Behind him walked his opposite, a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, with wide, sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws. His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung loosely.



-- George Milton is the small man, the thinker. Lennie Small is the child in a hulk's body. Walking ten miles to a barley ranch south of Soledad after a bus driver with a grudge drops them off on the highway far short of their destination, Lennie is fascinated by petting mice or rabbits or anything with a nice texture. Lennie has never laid a hand on George, enamored by the tales his traveling partner tells of the land they'll settle someday. When the men finally arrive for work, George does the talking.

""He ain't no cuckoo,"" said George. ""He's dumb as hell, but he ain't crazy. An' I ain't so bright neither, or I wouldn't be buckin' barley for my fifty and found. If I was bright, if I was even a little bit smart, I'd have my own little place, an' I'd be bringin' in my own crops, 'stead of doin' all the work and not getting what comes up outta the ground."" George fell silent. He wanted to talk. Slim neither encouraged nor discouraged him. He just sat back quiet and receptive.

-- One of the reasons John Steinbeck is my favorite author is that when he pens description, I don't want it to end, and when he switches to dialogue, I don't want his characters to stop talking either. Stephen King's dialogue can be tin, while Elmore Leonard's attentiveness when it comes to prose is short spanned to say the least, but Steinbeck's descriptions and dialogue achieve a purity that captivates me. It's like the difference between drinking water from a garden hose that's been drying in the sun with who knows what crawling inside it and one day, someone hands you a bottle of Perrier.

 

-- While most authors have been around people, with Steinbeck, I'm always left with the undeniable impression he watched and achieved a wisdom about people. Then he works that knowledge into his books and passes it along to the reader. I find myself able to relate to Steinbeck more than I can the majority of contemporary authors, who often seem to have never been around humans who dreamed, drank, lusted, got into fights or trouble with the law, fell out with family members or worried about where their next meal might come from.

Crooks said gently, ""Maybe you can see now. You got George. You know he's goin' to come back. S'pose you didn't have nobody. S'pose you couldn't go into the bunkhouse and play rummy 'cause you was black. How'd you like that? S'pose you had to sit out here an' read books. Sure you could play horseshoes till it got dark, but then you got to read books. Books ain't no good. A guy needs somebody--to be near him."" He whined, ""A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody. Don't make no difference who the guy is, long as he's with you. I tell ya,"" he cried, ""I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an' he gets sick.""

-- For those joining late, I'm no English teacher, but if I encountered someone who was adamant that they didn't read fiction (I'm thinking men here) and I wanted to try to get them to change their attitude, Of Mice and Men would be the novel I'd hand them. It's short, it's about men and work and figuring out a better future and loyalty and how things don't always work out the way you dream they will. Yet the writing takes me away to another place. I couldn't last a day bucking barley or bucking a sack of anything, but as Steinbeck knows well, we all yearn to be on the open road, traveling, camping out on a river and maybe eating beans just because we felt like it.

-- Lastly, Of Mice and Men has been adapted to film twice: a 1939 production starring Burgess Meredith as George and Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie and a 1992 film with Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie. Reading the novel, I heard Sinise's voice as George. As Lennie, I heard the Abominable Snowman from the 1949 Looney Toons short directed by Chuck Jones, The Abominable Snow Rabbit. References to Steinbeck's novel have been dropped by a ton of cartoon series, perhaps as much a tribute to Jones as to Steinbeck, but the homage that stands out for me are the characters of Pinky and the Brain on Animaniacs."
1176,Mark Lawrence,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Nov 06, 2010",5,"I read this story decades back with no special expectations. Like most books I read it just happened to be lying around the house. 

I read it, was hugely entertained, and went on to read three or four of the sequels.

I've heard since all manner of 'stuff' about the author but what's true and what isn't I don't know and I'm not here to critique the man behind the keyboard. All I can do is report on the contents of the book and those I can thoroughly recommend you check out.

The main character, Ender Wiggin, through whose eyes we see the story unfold, is a child genius. If you're one of those people who wants your protagonist to be an average member of society, typical of his/her age and gender... step away. Ender's story is told because he is very far from ordinary. 

OSC employs a bunch of fairly standard story-telling tricks. Our hero is underestimated at every turn, he exceeds expectations, we know he's got it in him and we're frustrated by the stoopid people who just won't see it. There's a bully/nemesis and nobody else but us sees just how nasty he is... However, OSC manages to bake an irresistible cake using those standard ingredients and once he starts sprinkling on originality as well, you've just got to eat it all.

This is sci-fi, not hard sci-fi, not soft sci-fi... let's say 'chewy'. It has a slightly old school EE Doc Smith feel to it, and you expect someone to pull out a monkey-wrench whenever the computer starts smoking, but none of that worried me. 

Given the date it was written there's some quite prescient stuff about the internet here, although shall we say ... optimistic ... about the ends to which it's put. Card foresaw rather more reasoned political/philosophical debate that swayed public opinion more effectively than rhetoric and demagoguery. And rather less hard core porn. 

Additionally the inclusion of female and Muslim characters whilst not front and centre was fairly progressive for 1985 (not ground breaking but certainly ahead of the curve).

This is actually a book with good messages (for the time) about equality, and one which poses interesting philosophical questions about what happens when races with orthogonal thought processes come into contact, and how far one can or should go in such situations.

There definitely is some characterisation going on. We're not talking Asimov's Foundation here where brilliant ideas invite you to forgive cardboard characters. The people here are decently drawn and Ender has his own angst (involving genius psychopathic siblings) that is quite engaging. However, it's the stuff that goes on that drives the story. The war games in preparation for battling the aliens, the unfortunately named 'Buggers'. These war games and Ender's brilliance in overcoming increasingly dire odds are a major theme and I loved them.

And then there's the twist. I'll say no more on that except that I was too engaged with the story to see it coming, and when it hit me ... well, I'd give the book 6* just for that moment. It doesn't work for everyone but it did for me!

EDIT: I have now seen the film - which I enjoyed. The film skips a lot that's important to the book, but I found it entertaining.

EDIT 2: Orson Scott Card reviewed *my* first trilogy. That's pretty damn cool!

1177,Overhaul,El juego de Ender ,"Dec 22, 2021",5,"‚ÄúS√≥lo el enemigo te ense√±a tus puntos d√©biles. S√≥lo el enemigo te ense√±a sus puntos fuertes. Y las √∫nicas reglas del juego son qu√© puedes hacerle y qu√© puedes impedir que √©l te haga.‚Äù


Este tiene que ser, sin duda, uno de los mejores libros de ciencia ficci√≥n escritos. El juego de Ender, es un libro que lees del tir√≥n, √°gil y muy bien escrito. Est√° ambientado en un escenario de ciencia ficci√≥n digamos algo sencillo, nada complejo. Una tierra del futuro amenazada por una especie alien√≠gena hostil con una tecnolog√≠a superior que parece decidida a destruir la raza humana. 


La historia se centra en un ni√±o, Ender, que es reclutado en un programa de entrenamiento militar que lo consume todo a la edad de nada menos que 6 a√±os. Este programa busca forjar una nueva, dura y muy superior generaci√≥n de comandantes militares a partir de estos ni√±os superdotados, y su √∫nico prop√≥sito es romperles a cualquier precio, con el prop√≥sito de descubrir a aquellos que no se puede romper.


Su protagonista, Ender Wiggin, tiene solo seis a√±os al comienzo de la novela y todav√≠a es un preadolescente cuando termina la historia. Los padres de Ender han recibido un permiso especial para tener un tercer hijo a pesar de las estrictas leyes de control de la poblaci√≥n en la sociedad en la que viven. Sus brillantes hermanos mayores, Peter y Valentine, tienen todo tipo de promesas, pero a√∫n no tienen lo que se necesita para ser considerados como el comandante que la Flota Internacional necesita tan desesperadamente.


La novela plantea una pregunta importante: ¬øQu√© se necesita para llevar con √©xito a los hombres/ni√±os a la batalla? La batalla se nos presenta en forma de invasiones alien√≠genas. Durante la √∫ltima invasi√≥n que tuvo lugar, la humanidad sobrevivi√≥ gracias a la brillantez de Mazer Rackham, el comandante de la Flota Internacional.


A√±os m√°s tarde, se teme una tercera invasi√≥n y el I.F. cree que Ender puede ser el comandante que necesitan. Esperan que pueda llevarlos a la victoria en caso de que los ""insectores"" vuelvan a invadir la Tierra.


‚ÄúPero como los adultos siempre dec√≠an lo mismo cuando algo iba a doler, pod√≠a considerar esa afirmaci√≥n como una predicci√≥n exacta del futuro. Algunas veces las mentiras eran m√°s de fiar que las verdades.‚Äù


Lo que sigue es una historia emocionalmente compleja y en ocasiones dolorosamente familiar de ni√±os que luchan por aceptar sus demonios internos. Ender, en particular, es el que m√°s destaca, una combinaci√≥n brutal de profunda empat√≠a por los dem√°s y un abrumador instinto de supervivencia que lo impulsa a ganar sin importar el costo. Es esta combinaci√≥n de dones que pueden convertirlo en el comandante que la flota necesita en su guerra contra los invasores alien√≠genas, pero solo si Ender puede encontrar una manera de comprender a su enemigo tan a fondo que ya no pueda verlos como, el otro bando, sino como un reflejo de s√≠ mismo.


La historia es vertiginosa, y el estilo de Card me gust√≥, un lenguaje sencillo y una descripci√≥n simplificada que sirve para llevar a todos los personajes al frente y al centro de la historia en todo momento. Card trata a sus muy j√≥venes protagonistas como personajes tridimensionales inteligentes y ya plenamente realizados que luchan con preguntas muy adultas.


La otra firma de Card es crear drama a trav√©s de varios dilemas √©ticos, esto tambi√©n es un elemento central de la historia, y hace un muy buen trabajo al desafiar al lector a encontrar algo parecido a un terreno moral elevado en cualquier lugar. Los conflictos entre personajes se vuelven a√∫n m√°s poderosos por la casi total falta de misterio, pues las motivaciones y la intenci√≥n se presentan con mucha claridad en la mayor√≠a de los casos, y es la capacidad del lector para empatizar con el punto de vista de todos lo que hace que la historia sea menos sobre ganar o perder y m√°s sobre vivir con las consecuencias de cualquier resultado.


‚ÄúLa humanidad no nos pide que seamos felices. S√≥lo nos pide ser brillantes en su nombre.‚Äù


Este libro me sorprendi√≥ y much√≠simo, lo admito es estimulante, emocionalmente muy complejo y √©ticamente desafiante. Es un examen poderoso del conflicto y la violencia, la necesidad militar, los roles familiares y las formas en que usamos la idea del ""otro"" para justificar todo tipo de salvajismo. Por cierto, la pel√≠cula vamos es que no le llega al libro ni usando microscopio. Este libro y mira que ya llevo unas cuantas joyas de la CF, cl√°sica, los mejores para m√≠. Este ocupa un lugar al lado de, Flores para Algernon.


El libro es mucho mejor que la pel√≠cula. S√© que probablemente hay√°is le√≠do esta frase y otras en muchas rese√±as. No puedo llegar a expresar completamente todo lo que ha sido la exquisita lectura de, El juego de Ender. Es que no puedo encontrar un solo defecto. Todo perfectamente escrito y construido. 


""S√≥lo hay una cosa que har√° que dejen de odiarte. Y esa cosa es ser tan bueno en todo lo que hagas que no puedan ignorarte.""


El desarrollo de los personajes en el libro es realmente asombroso. Realmente no se parece en nada a la forma en que la pel√≠cula present√≥ a los personajes. Todos se sent√≠an importantes y su transformaci√≥n tuvo un gran impacto para m√≠. Personajes como, Valentine y Peter estaban muy establecidos, y su viaje cuando eran ni√±os fue algo diferente, completamente interesante y divertido al mismo tiempo. La pel√≠cula creo que ni mostr√≥ que ambos se convirtieron en Dem√≥stenes y Locke. Esa parte de su historia realmente me asombr√≥. Este libro mostr√≥ que la edad no importa para marcar la diferencia. Se trata de ni√±os y ni√±as que muestran un enorme coraje y adem√°s absoluto conocimiento. No me agradaba nada Peter en el sentido moral, pero su violencia e intimidaci√≥n creo que llevaron al crecimiento positivo de Ender y Valentine. Y si afect√≥ a Ender de mala manera, pero si luego observamos el cambio general que emanaba Ender, es notable c√≥mo la violencia condujo al √©xito. Creo que el autor fue demasiado duro con sus personajes, demasiado duro pero es esto precisamente lo que m√°s destaca del libro y en el buen sentido. La trama es interesante y da varios giros, destacando sobretodo el final y el enorme desarrollo de los personajes, ah√≠ fueron incre√≠bles. Muy bien escrito y est√° todo pensado para impactar al lector. Es algo original para m√≠ al menos y asombroso.


""Podr√≠a matarte as√≠, susurr√≥ Peter. Solo presiona y presiona hasta que est√©s muerto""


Escuela de Batalla, donde los ni√±os brillantes son entrenados en estrategia y duras t√°cticas militares. Ender est√° aislado, es ridiculizado, intimidado y pr√°cticamente perseguido. Pero es decidido y muestra los medios para sobrevivir e incluso prosperar y evolucionar en esas dif√≠ciles circunstancias. Su asombrosa inteligencia, con la que el ni√±o aprende a ser un l√≠der y a actuar con la venganza de un soldado. Su juventud y peque√±a estatura no logran detenerlo, y Ender asciende r√°pidamente. Ender tiene solo 12 a√±os cuando comienza a comandar a sus compa√±eros soldados, gan√°ndose as√≠ su respeto y, en √∫ltima instancia, su miedo hacia √©l. Todo termina en sorpresas.


La pieza central de su educaci√≥n es un juego que simula una batalla. Ender es muy bueno en este juego, y esta es la raz√≥n principal por la que se convierte en el comandante m√°s joven de la historia. De todos modos, la vida de Ender en la escuela y los diversos juegos, pruebas y tribulaciones en las que sobresale ya no solo est√°n maravillosamente escritos sino que es una gozada ir leyendo todo lo que pasa, creando en el lector una necesidad de querer ver como evoluciona en concreto el personaje de Ender y como termina su dura preparaci√≥n. Es un libro impresionante, en todos los niveles. Impresionante e imprescindible.


‚ÄúLos seres humanos son libres, excepto cuando la humanidad los necesita. A lo mejor la humanidad te necesita. Para hacer algo. Creo que la humanidad me necesita a m√≠ para averiguar para qu√© sirves. Los dos podemos hacer cosas despreciables, Ender; pero si la humanidad sobrevive, habremos sido buenos instrumentos.‚Äù"

1180,Michael,The Book Thief,"Jun 10, 2008",1,"I am apparently one of the few people who just do not see what all of the hype is about on this one. I was really excited to read this after all of the glowing reviews it got, but I was left extremely disappointed. I found the writing stilted and stuttering (hard to stutter in writing, but this book pulls it off), overly sentimental, and heavy-handed on the symbolism.

I also found the author's approach to the story to be just plain gimmicky. The first and foremost gimmick (also see heavyy-handed symbolism) is that the story is narrated by Death. Now, this might work in some books, but not this one. The choice of narrator adds absolutely nothing to the story; it is only a distraction to the reader, and it also encouraged the author to add trite observations about Death's perspective (for example, he doesn't carry a scythe, but likes the human image) that add nothing to the story. If Death here had been given developed personality or a unique perspective, then maybe (and even then it's a stretch) the choice of narrator would have worked. As it is, the story is told almost entirely as though by an omniscient narrator (is Death omniscient?) and we get absolutely nothing from the choice of Death to fill the role. It's a gimmick, and it falls flat.

The other gimmick I found most distracting (these are not the only two, but they are the most egregious) is the repeated use of little newsflash-type, bold and centered notes that appear periodically through the story to highlight some stupid point and add (in the author's mind) dramatic effect. These newsflashes, as I think of them, were irritating and served only to break up the natural narrative flow without adding anything significant. This is another example of the author hitting the reader over the head with his points, rather than trusting his own writing to get the message across. This is another ill-conceived and heavy-handed gimmick intended to correct for a poor narrative.

I think it is telling that while this book gets listed as teen fiction, Zusak actually wrote it for adults. For some reason, it got identified as being for teens when it got marketed in the U.S. (it was written in Australia). It seems to me that the explanation for this change is that the novel feels like it was written by a very immature author, and so the prose does not attain the quality one should expect of adult fiction.

I think good Holocaust stories need to be told, but the Book Thief fails at that endeavor. The story is trite; the narrative is sentimental and uninspired. I recommend that you look elsewhere for something better. If you want something for younger readers, try Number the Stars, by Lois Lowry. If you're a bit older, also read Night by Elie Weisel or the Diary of Anne Frank. I might even add in Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, to counteract the heavy-handed book-burning theme of the Book Thief. There's plenty more out there that better deserve your time and attention than does this book."

The Perks of Being a Wallflower ~~ Stephen Chbosky




Passivity vs. Passion ‚Ä¶


Yes Charlie ~~ I know all too well what it‚Äôs like. 

Charlie is an outsider ~~ a typical wallflower. He gets bullied at school and prefers taking the forty minute walk home instead of the school bus. Written in the form of letters from Charlie to an anonymous recipient, it is a compelling read. Don't let its simplicity fool you, as this book has much depth. Readers learn that Charlie has many secrets that have been entrusted to him; one in particular has caused him to become a quiet person without a voice, letting people do what they want to him. (view spoiler)[He passively witnesses a rape, has a girlfriend he doesn't really like, aids his sister in getting an abortion, takes drugs and alcohol others give him, smokes, and even lets his grieving gay friend Patrick kiss him just to make Patrick feel better. (hide spoiler)] These things upset Charlie, but he internalizes them. Sam, the girl he desires from a distance, encourages Charlie to form his own opinions, speak his mind, and to show passion about his desires.


 
Charlie himself is a mystery. He has mental problems, gets angry, sees things and then passes out and cries. Right before he started high school his best friend shot himself, but there is also another, worse reason for his problems. At school Charlie meets Patrick and Sam, both of whom are outsiders too, just cooler ones. Patrick is gay and before his stepsister Sam introduced him to ""good"" music, he was a popular kid. They introduce Charlie to all kinds of new things. Parties, drugs, Rocky Horror, Billie Holliday and rock music become new parts of Charlie's life. For the first time in his life, Patrick knows what it really means to have good friends.

Charlie's immediate family is loving and supportive. Charlie's friend Patrick is gay and in a relationship that is accepted in their social circle. Homophobia is present, however--a boy is beaten by his father for being gay after he‚Äôs caught being intimate with Patrick, and Patrick is in turn beaten by his boyfriend and the football jocks at school.

Aren‚Äôt we all too familiar with the set-up where the loser turns out to be the really cool, popular guy? Well, all this is true too for 
The Perks of Being a Wallflower
 but just wait and you will find so much more. This book is going to catch and surprise you every time you turn a page.


In a series of letters written by Charlie and sent to an anonymous person we learn about his life, his new friends, his family and especially Charlie himself. He writes about school and his English teacher, Bill, who gives Charlie extra books to read. Charlie then writes essays about them. He would like to become a writer someday.

What makes this book so special and authentic is its reality. As an adult it takes you back to when you were a teenager, as a child it shows you what lies ahead and as a teenager it inspires you. And as we all know there is no other time when finding out who you are and where you belong to is more immediate than when you are a teenager."
1183,Lisa,Les Mis√©rables,"Jun 25, 2014",5,"What makes a favourite book?
 
In this case, I will have to say: one single character that broke my heart and shaped my idealism and stirred my anger: Gavroche Th√©nardier.

""Si l'on demandait √† la grande et √©norme ville : Qu'est-ce que c'est que cela ? elle r√©pondrait : C'est mon petit."" 
 
One of those street children that see and hear more during their childhood than most people ever experience, who carry pain and neglect with them on their daily adventures to survive in a hostile, careless environment, and still manage to find reasons to love and to live, he made me want to work with children when I was myself still only a teenager. I also wept with his sister √âponine, and with Cosette's mother Fantine, and I followed in Gavroche's tracks through the drama of Parisian 19th century history. His fight became my cause.



The main characters, Jean Valjean and his adoptive daughter Cosette, left me rather cold by contrast, as they seemed too perfectly good, too beautiful, too physically strong and mentally one-dimensional to be shaped from real life, and I am not sure Les Mis√©rables would have ranged among my most beloved books, had the novel been slimmed down to their specific plot. The story line of Javert, whose fanatic sense of justice reminds me of later Communist anti-human radicalism, was what made Jean Valjean interesting as a character, rather than his own personality. Would he be caught or not?

I will also have to confess that I would have loved to see the poor, abused √âponine find happiness with Marius, as I truly couldn't find anything exciting in the doll Cosette that Jean Valjean had raised. √âponine had the potential to become a bright young woman, had she not grown up with comically bad parents in severe poverty:

""On sentait bien qu‚Äôavec d‚Äôautres conditions d‚Äô√©ducation et de destin√©e, l‚Äôallure gaie et libre de cette jeune fille e√ªt pu √™tre quelque chose de doux et de charmant."" 

The neglected children of Paris - that is what Les Mis√©rables means to me. Ever since I first read the novel during my adolescence, it has accompanied me on my adventures. Gavroche comes to my mind whenever I read about neglected children in the big cities of the world, and now that my own children read the story, and play the soundtrack of the Musical on the piano and sing along with all the pathos they remember from seeing it performed at Broadway in New York, I feel the old shiver down my spine, and I know that one of the sources of my energy as a mother and teacher is to be found in the early feeling of indignation and tenderness towards a child that deserved a better life than he got. He deserved a future. I still believe in that simple idealist dream: each child deserves a future.

""Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again!
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!"""
1184,veronica,The Princess Bride,"Jun 16, 2008",2,"** spoiler alert **
           I know there are people who LOOOOOOOVE the film, ""The Princess Bride."" While I thoroughly enjoy the movie, I think I may only LOOVE it. I mean, Inigo Montoya is FABULOUS and I really really dug Westley, and the pwiest was vewwy vewwy funny!!!! So, when someone was kind enough to lend me the book, I had relatively high expectations. Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't disappointed in The Princess Bride, but I just wasn't thrilled or moved to laugh till I cry (which the movie sometimes can).

First of all, let's get all English-major on this, and talk about the meta-layered frame narratives going on in this novel. Holy cow! First of all, keep in mind that the book's title is The Princess Bride, S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure. Basically, what Goldman does is this -- he tells his readers that the book they are holding in their hand (his book) is actually the abridgment of the original PB written by this invented author, Morgenstern. As a child, says Goldman (within the novel, not in the introduction or anything), his father read PB to him aloud, and the boy fell in love with the book. When, as a father himself, he attempted to pass on this beloved childhood novel to his very fat and very spoiled son, he is shocked to find out that the boy can't get into the book -- because it is too long and too boring! It turns out that Goldman's father, when reading to the boy, had skipped hundreds of pages of political and historical satire! So, when Goldman's own son attempted to read the book, he found it overly dry and long. This leads Goldman to undertake the task of abridging PB and basically re-publish the book as his father had read it to him -- just the adventure plot and the romance.

While bearing this in mind, you must remember that Goldman is making all of this up. There is no Morgenstern, no original PB. The project in itself is quite interesting and it had me excited at reading a book that really messed with the reader's perception of narrator, of what's real and what isn't. Goldman often includes long parenthesis in which he bitches about his frigid wife or his snotty son, or over some of the stunted romantic liaisons that he failed at. All in all, I must say, that the actual narrator of PB comes off as an ego maniacal and pathetic loser who happens to have been the screenwriter for some awesome movies (think ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""Misery."" (One interesting aside is the confrontation between Goldman and Stephen King over supposedly abridging the sequel to PB, called Buttercup's Baby, a conversation in which they discuss Kathy Bates' performance in ""Misery."")

Once you get over the self-loathing and self-loving that the narrator is indulging in while writing this book, you get to the actual storyline. Westley hearts Buttercup, but she is to be married to Prince Humperdink. Meanwhile, Inigo Montoya searches for his father's six-fingered murderer, Fezzik plods along like a dumb giant, and about 300 pages into the novel, these 2 team up with Westley in an attempt to steal Buttercup away from Humperdink.

The good news is that some of the movie's best scenes are taken verbatim from the book. Inigo Montoya is as fabulous here as he is in the movie. Actually, even more so, because you get a pretty in depth history of his childhood, his training, his thought process. He is by far the most interesting character in the novel.

The scene with Miracle Max is also as rewarding as it is in the movie, and the funniest scene in the book is the marriage (mawwiage) scene.

Still, a couple interesting scenes do not a great novel make, and for once, I may have found a book that I enjoyed less than its film adaptation! Ring the bells and sound the alarms!!

Ah, and I see God is agreeing with me! I have just looked out of our great scenic window, and the most BEAUTIFUL rainbow has just appeared.

To wrap up, I must say that I was left a bit deflated by The Princess Bride. It has a little zing, a little sappy romance, and a little adventure, but overall, I think I approached it about 15 years too late. Had I read it when I was 10, I'm sure it would still to this day be one of my favorites.

P.S. Take one ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" Repeat until it becomes unnerving. Result -- the best scene in the novel and the film, by a landslide. Oh, Inigo. I love you. And in this book, only you. I should pull a Goldman and abridge The Princess Bride and leave in only Inigo's part, and add on to his story line. Food for thought!"
1185,Brigid ‚ú©,The Outsiders,"Feb 13, 2008",5,"I LOVE this book. I don't know why I find it so good. The whole thing just seems so real. It's really exciting, and the characters are all really believable. I like how the story was written by a young author who really knew what she was writing about--she based it partly on the experiences of her friends. It's like people say--""Write what you know."" And S.E. Hinton did just that, and did an excellent job. The book does have some corny parts, and is one of very few books that actually made me cry. But it's really fantastic, and I think everyone in the whole world should read it! (But don't watch the movie. It's awful.)"
1186,jessica,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Nov 27, 2018",5,"‚Äòbehind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic.‚Äô


and boy, this story was an exquisite tragedy. wilde admits that the books which the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. and this is one of the most immoral books i have ever read.

this is a story about the loss of innocence, of revelling in sin and debauchery, and everything in between. but its also an examination of the human soul, its struggle with vanity, and a life lived without any sort of accountability. and whilst dorian realised that physical beauty is finite, the beauty of this story is not. 

the complex characters, multifaceted plot, relevant messages, and elegant writing are what make this a powerful and timeless masterpiece. 

so i will take an immoral story over a moral one any day. because its the exquisite tragedies that prompt the best introspection and show us the most accurate picture of ourselves.

1188,Mario the lone bookwolf,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Mar 07, 2018",5,"A timeless genre picture of a strong woman making the best out of terrible circumstances. 

Not just the personal story of the main protagonist is very well written, it¬¥s how Japans¬¥culture and history are shown in a new perspective one wouldn¬¥t have ever thought of because of the stigmas and prejudices the same men haunting the poor women are imposing on them with their conservative, misogynic policy.

The Asian way
Sexist male dominance manifested in many different forms and how the Japanese culture arranged prostitution has hardly ever been described in such memorable words, metaphors, and pictures. The strange thing is that all that glitter and glamour around it, letting it seem cultivated and less primitive, creates the disturbing impression that it¬¥s not as bad as it is, something so cognitive biasy that it¬¥s hard to stomach, understand, and put in context to the cultural impact, especially when comparing the very different approaches towards it around the world. 
 
Prostituion by region
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostit...
As so often, the Scandinavians set the best, new policies
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostit...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostit...
, with ‚ÄûNeo-abolitionism - illegal to buy sex and for 3rd party involvement, legal to sell sex‚Äú (that¬¥s once a word with Neo that is not evil)
thereby making it illegal for the clients to buy sex and not criminalize the prostitutes. That¬¥s an important approach away from victim blaming and slut shaming, the punishment of the female victims, and offender protection that is law in many other bigoted, conservative, sexist states, towards a more enlightened society. Critics like to claim that this would increase sexual violence and rape, but maybe just every sexual offender should be facing life imprisonment without any chance of probation, maybe including permanent chemical castration so that he can¬¥t all the time happily masturbate to his snuff rape fantasies in his cell.
 
Traditions and culture of exploitation
According to the stereotypical calm, silent, mindful, and introverted Asian mentality, even the sex business is full of ceremonies, traditions, and elements that couldn¬¥t have developed in other cultures with less focus on elegance and aesthetics. Of course, it¬¥s still sick and disgusting, but at least it goes with the option for women to reach a certain status and adds art, culture, and class to the perverted mix.
 
Talent and obsession
It¬¥s one of the greatest fiction without fantasy novels I¬¥ve read, one of the rare cases when talent meets the lifelong interest of an author in a topic or culture and is distilled to something so amazing that it isn¬¥t exaggerated to say that there might hardly be ever a similar novel written that has the same intensity in dealing with this theme. 
 
Sociocultural impact of prostitution
What¬¥s more bigoted, letting it all seem shiny, noble, and cultivated, hiding it or making it illegal or the open, direct, strangely still somewhat illegal, Western way? There is so much behind this, parts of it already mentioned in ‚ÄûProstitution by region‚Äú, and it would take far too long to mention all the complexity, and especially misogyny, behind it. And who is causing and promoting it for millennia, and I don¬¥t mean the male sex drive alone, but to what institutions, that make sex and love punished, abolished, or dominated by crazy, stupid rules full of sexism, hate, and misogyny, its degeneracy has mutated. The faithful creating hell on Earth for multi k years since the neolithic, first agricultural revolution to install bloody dictatorships, what a slogan. 
 
Drugs
I don¬¥t know if there are hidden implications and innuendos about Western trade traditions, especially how to get bestselling products into the Chinese market,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_W...
I don¬¥t get, but it seems quite probable that there is something deep lurking in the big history meta background. However, even without that, and me overanalyzing and seeing things that aren¬¥t there as if high as heck, it¬¥s always a great trope to get someone insane in the membrane to get the plot started, show ones¬¥ brain on whatever, and how people slowly fall to pieces.
 
Subjective insecurity
This is absolutely not my genre, so my impression and subjective review might be more than incompetent regarding established rating standards, but I definitively like this different, character focused style of storytelling that teaches much about foreign cultures. Hopefully, the writer did his research and it¬¥s accurate, because some reviewers seem to be critical regarding this fact. But, as said, I am an absolute amateur in reading protagonist¬¥ focused stuff and just loved the show.

For all the book's faults (in particular a draggy middle), I haven't read a book yet with such chemistry between the two main characters. Add to that Niffenegger's beautiful use of language and dry sense of humor and this is a book I keep going back to.

I read this again a couple of weeks ago and because I'm going to start reviewing more books (even though I'm not very good at it) I wanted to review this particular book more than any other book. 
Twilight, I love you. I love the series. And the films. Enough said. 
I don't know if it's because of the story or what, but this whole series will forever have a place in my heart, it's just one of those series you have to read.
I could watch the films over and over again, even in the same day.
A gripping story line with a love triangle between two completely different beings.
Some days I wish I was Bella, because then I'd change who she bloody chooses!
Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, oh how I adore you...
Bella can keep Edward for all I care, I want the wolf. xD
It's weird because when I used to talk to people about Twilight, I always used to ask people what team they were, and the majority of the people said Edward!

1191,Robert,The Da Vinci Code ,"Feb 22, 2008",5,"For the most part, it seems that people either passionately love this book or they passionately hate it. I happen to be one of the former. For my part, I don't see the book so much as an indictment of the Catholic Church in particular but of religious extremism and religion interfering in political process in general. The unwarranted political control granted to extreme religious organizations like the CBN is an issue that we will be forced to address one way or the other. To my eye, our political process has been poisoned by it and the danger of theocracy is quite real. Furthermore, Brown's indictment of the Church for removing or suppressing feminine divinity figures is justified and needs a much closer look. Women do not have enough of a role in religion, religious practice, heroic myths, and creation myths, nor are they portrayed as divinity figures enough. In short, our religious systems and institutions lack balance and have a bias to suppress issues, stories, and roles that empower women to live as equals to men. Finally, Brown wrote his story simplistically, in my view, to spread his tale to as broad an audience as possible. Though it is not as pristine a narrative as, say, Umberto Eco, the message it conveys is one that needs to be heard. More obscure books on the matter are not as accessible as Da Vinci Code and if someone were to write an accessible book of genius on this subject, I would give him/her all due praise. In the meantime, Dan Brown is telling a story that needs to be told. It is one that has been kept quiet and in the dark for far too long."
1192,Lisa of Troy,Fahrenheit 451,"Dec 01, 2022",5,"‚ÄúDo you notice how people hurt each other nowadays?‚Äù
-	Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451

Who is one of my favorite authors? Neil Gaiman. 

When I opened Fahrenheit 451, who should write the introduction but none other than Neil Gaiman. So how can I not like this book?

Just to give some historical context, Fahrenheit 451 is a fantasy book written in 1953. This was before cell phones, color television, and of course the internet. The story is premised on what if firemen started fires instead of putting them out. What if firemen burned books?

Fahrenheit 451 is about censorship, but it is much more than that. Bradbury was writing about the future which is now our present. It is almost eerie to see how closely he predicted the future. The book even mentions 2022! 

There are also a lot of great quotes in Fahrenheit 451, and this book is especially chilling in the modern era of book banning.

What a fun weird little story!"
1194,Cindy,City of Bones ,"Feb 11, 2021",3,"I was surprisingly into this book when I first started! The world-building is super creative and fun, and I can see why so many people love the series. I really like the concept of all these supernatural creatures coexisting in the same world as us, and that there is a class of people who have to keep them in order. I came in with super low expectations because a lot of people said the writing is terrible, but honestly, I found Cassandra Clare's writing to be better than some of the current YA fantasy books I've read. There are some cheesy dated lines, sure, but it's still solid - she takes time to describe in detail the settings and the world around them, and you can tell she has a lot of love for the characters. Unfortunately, the second half of the book put me in a huge reading slump where I stopped caring about the story, especially with the cartoonish villain as the crux of all their conflict.. I think what didn‚Äôt help was how expositional the writing became - Clare falls into the pit of info dumping a lot of the background stories to the point where it feels like you‚Äôre reading a Wikipedia summary. I also wasn‚Äôt a fan of how certain relationships turned out with the compulsory girl/girl hate, the friend zone mentality and trying to make another character jealous, and obviously, the plot twist at the end about certain characters was unnecessary."
1195,Shovelmonkey1,Little Women,"May 05, 2011",1,"To me this book is just a big neon highlighted literary exclamation mark defining how incredibly different I am from my mother. She loves this book. Really, really loves it....a lot. She always used to tell me how great she thought it was although, as a kid I somehow avoided reading it; mainly because at this point I was too busy dangling from a climbing frame by my ankles or stealing scrap wood from building sites in order to make dens and tree houses.

As it is prominently placed on the 1001 books list I thought, ""What the hell I'll give it a go"". Man oh man what an epic snooze fest. Less than twenty pages in I could feel my mind slowly shutting down. Was it through boredom? Or was I entering a diabetic coma because of the saccharine overload created by the sickly sweet world of Margaret, Jo, Beth and Amy? Anyway to avoid succumbing to said coma I threw the book as far away from me as I could and then chucked a blanket over it to ensure that I wouldn't be effected by the mind numbing dullness being exuded from between the covers. 

I know that I risk howls of outrage at this lambasting of a much loved classic but this ticked no boxes for me. I am clearly dead inside."

The Written Review

""Though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's heart and--it would not do."" 

""It would do,"" I affirmed with some disdain, ""perfectly well.
Oh Jane, you wondrously bold and beautiful gal. 

After she was orphaned, Jane Eyre was sent to live with her maternal uncle and his wife (Mrs. Reed). When her uncle dies, he forces his wife to swear to love, nurture and care for Jane as if she was their own child. 

Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Reed is not pleased in the least with this arrangement and does the absolute bare minimum towards Jane. She spoils her three biological children but sees Jane as a wicked, conniving and devilish child (despite ample evidence against). 
 I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child‚Äîthough equally dependent and friendless‚ÄîMrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling
 Jane is sent off to boarding school where life is harsher than before (threadbare clothes, small rations) but she prefers it for she has finally found what she's been missing.
There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
 At the end of her time there, she sets off to be a governess. She takes a job for a Mr. Rochester and tutors his young ward, Adel. 

Only, when she arrives at the house, she starts to notice certain things. The servants know something is up and won't tell her. Mr. Rochester is hiding a huge mystery and despite the danger, and the difference in social standing, Jane Eyre is falling ever faster in love.

An absolutely stunning book. 

This is my third time through, and each time I am blown away by Jane's strength of character. With every twist life hurled at her, Jane merely straightened her shoulders, adjusted her pack and trudged on. 

Each time I read this novel, I notice something different. This time, it was how much Charlotte Bronte slipped her own beliefs into the novel:
Precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings...It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
It made for a truly eye-opening reread

Read by Nadia May. I may be the only one with this - but whenever I read a really old novel, I find it much easier to listen to (opposed to reading a copy). I spend less time puzzling out the language and unfamiliar terms and more time enjoying the story. I highly recommend listening to this book if you've tried reading it and just couldn't get into it.

1198,Shannon,Anne of Green Gables ,"Feb 17, 2009",5,"I don't often give books five stars and as I neared the end of this book, I gave some thought to how many stars this book deserved. I've read the Anne of Green Gables series once before - over twenty years ago. In spite of the amount of time that has elapsed, I clearly recall reading the last book in the series very slowly and thinking to myself, ""I will be so sad to not be able to read about Anne anymore."" When I picked up this book a few days ago to re-read it, I found within a few chapters that it was like seeing an old friend. Anne was even more delightful than I recalled, since I now have daughters who share her ""scope for imagination,"" her penchant for large words and her zest for life. Reading about Anne's appreciation for life's loveliness made me appreciate my daughters and long to live more in-the-moment myself. So, I decided that a book that feels like an old friend after twenty years deserves five stars.

Anne Shirley must be one of the most delightful characters ever written, largely because she is far from perfect. She makes mistakes, as we all do, but her mistakes are much funnier than my own feel and she makes me see the value in learning from each of them, laughing at them and moving on. Like my middle daughter, there is no lukewarm with Anne. I love that she approaches life enthusiastically, despite have spent a decade belonging to no one.

I also like that Anne talks straightforwardly about wanting, seeking and building friendships. Even now, I am hesitant, awkward and scattershot at building relationships. I may meet someone who seems a kindred spirit, but lack the time or, let's be honest, sheer boldness to approach them and seek to build a friendship. We see Anne seek and build relationships not only upon her arrival in Avonlea, but during her time at Queens.

One reasons I re-read this book was because two friends recommended it for it's fluency in writing dialogue. Unlike Little Women, which I attempted to read for the writing, this book did not disappoint. The dialogue sounds exactly like each character would sound and it flows smoothly from narration to dialogue and back. In fact, I'm baffled that Little Women routinely makes top 100 lists while Anne of Green Gables is nowhere to be found on the lists of must-read classics. Unlike the Little Women characters who are archetypes rather than three dimensional characters, Anne is a bold a female character who refuses to be categorized. That's exactly why I love her and love this book."

1200,Sean Barrs,Fahrenheit 451,"Apr 25, 2015",5,"‚ÄúThere must be something in books, something we can‚Äôt imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don‚Äôt stay for nothing.‚Äù


The burning of books is such an effective tool for controlling the population, so the message of Ray Bradbury‚Äôs Fahrenheit 451 is scarily real. If society‚Äôs wisdom could be taken away, then so could their freedom. If knowledge was burnt, then the people would be left in a complete state of utter innocent ignorance. There would be no room for free thought, that way they could be told anything about history and themselves. If all books were burnt, then they are just sheep to be led into a future dictated by the government. To make it worse the men who do it enjoy it. 

Books have become illegal; thus, owning them is a form of disobedience against the state and a violation of the law. The books are burnt by a special group of firefighters, yes firefighters, which hunt readers mercilessly. When they find them, they burn their beloved collection and leave them to die. One woman burns with her books by her own choosing rather than submit to ignorance. The firefighters don‚Äôt know exactly why they do it, they rarely question it, they just do it unflinchingly because that is what they are told to do. And they cannot understand why somebody would fight to the death to defend the written word. 

Guy Montag is one such firefighter. He lives a mundane life with an equally mundane partner. He‚Äôs miserable. He carries out the book burnings, like the others, without a second thought until one day an innocent young girl changes his life forever. She is his next-door neighbour and she is a closet book reader; she asks him a series of questions that makes him realise how stupid and worthless his existence is. He takes solace in a collection of books he has stolen whilst on the job, a symbol that he and the world could one day be free. The knowledge he gains changes his perception of the world forever. 

Books have fallen out of favour as other mediums have taken priority over them. People have become hostile to books because they feel inferior when faced with an educated reader; thus, if they are removed forever everyone will be the same and minorities will be removed. Individuality would die. Consequently, when Guy begins reading, he does not know what to do anymore; he has been conditioned to act in a certain way, and when liberty presents itself, he is reluctant and confused by his new knowledge. He is a reluctant hero but a hero, nonetheless. He has stolen one of the last surviving copies of the Bible but doesn‚Äôt know what it is. However, a professor of the bygone age does and what comes after is one of the most powerful and symbolic endings I‚Äôve ever read in science-fiction. 

This really is required reading for anyone who is serious about science fiction and dystopian fiction because it really is one of the best in both genres.

1202,Lisa of Troy,The Book Thief,"Apr 08, 2022",3,"Interesting Premise but Uneven Pacing

There are tons of books about World War II, and I had high hopes for this book as it was a fictional account, not bound to a concrete set of facts. The Book Thief has a narrator who is Death, and it follows the story of a young German girl named Liesel Meminger.

The plot was a great concept, but the book didn‚Äôt live up to its potential. The book was unique in that I hadn‚Äôt previously read a book about World War II from the perspective of a German citizen. Many characters in the book were children, and it was gut wrenching to experience their innocence evaporate. 

However, the book had two serious flaws. One, it was really far too long. If I was editing this book, I would take out all of the instances of fistfights. They didn‚Äôt really move the plot along, and this book was nearly 14 hours long, more than 500 pages. The first 25% and last 25% were riveting, but the middle part kept me nodding off. As for the second flaw, the foreshadowing was far too strong. Now, I do enjoy the occasional well-timed hint or whisper. In this instance, it seemed like constant reminders (both whispers and shouts).

1203,Blaine,The Princess Bride,"May 07, 2020",5,"I smiled at him. How could he not like it? Passion. Duels. Miracles. Giants. True love.I am assuming you have seen this movie. If you somehow haven‚Äôt yet, stop reading this review right now, go watch the movie (I‚Äôll lend you my copy) and then come back. Seriously. I‚Äôll wait.

The list of books that are not as good as the movie is really short. I can think of eleven (I keep a running list on my profile page).  A Clockwork Orange,  The Devil Wears Prada and  The Perks of Being a Wallflower are flawed books that were turned into good movies.  Searching for Bobby Fischer,  Starship Troopers, Jaws, and  The Hunt for Red October are solid books that were turned into great movies. And four‚Äî The Martian,  The Godfather,  The Silence of the Lambs, and this book, The Princess Bride‚Äîare great books that were turned into all-time masterpiece-level movies.

Mr. Goldman wrote the screenplay as well as the novel. In the movie, he used the framing device of the grandfather reading the story to his sick grandson. For a fairy tale, I think it‚Äôs better than the device in the book, which is more meta. William Goldman is a character in the novel, at first explaining how it came to be that he had published a ‚Äúgood parts‚Äù abridgment of the (completely fictitious) Florinese classic book by S. Morgenstern. He then appears in fourth-wall-breaking notes that pop up throughout the remainder of the book, making comments and explaining sections that he had edited out.

But the core of the novel The Princess Bride‚Äîthe fairy tale‚Äîis almost exactly as it is in the movie, and it‚Äôs wonderful. Westley and Buttercup. Fezzik, Inigo, and Vezzini. Humperdinck and Count Rugen. ‚ÄúAs you wish.‚Äù ‚ÄúInconceivable.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not left-handed.‚Äù ‚ÄúHello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.‚Äù William Goldman was a brilliant writer. He wrote a great, inventive, sarcastic fairy tale novel. He then took the ‚Äúgood parts‚Äù of the novel and wrote a absolutely classic movie. A must-read."

Charlotte, a spider

I always get in the mood for this book when county fair season rolls around. Ah, the midway with it's dizzying rides and scary carny folk. The agriculture buildings featuring prize-winning giant produce and lovingly crafted quilts. And the yummy scents of frying dough competing with the much earthier smells emanating from the livestock tents.

It smelled of hay and it smelled of manure. It smelled of the perspiration of tired horses and the wonderful sweet breath of patient cows. It often had a sort of peaceful smell - as though nothing bad could ever happen again in the world.

 I always pay a visit to the cows, sheep and pigs temporarily housed there, and try not to think about how many of them are doomed, already auctioned off to local restaurants. With that sad fact in mind, is it any wonder how this fanciful tale can grip the imagination and tug at the heart . . . the story of Zuckerman's Famous Pig - Wilbur, the Pig Who Lived!

The book begins with our hero narrowly avoiding the ax, saved from death by a young girl who promises to raise him. He grows and thrives under her care, but soon he's sentenced to a lonely life in a pen at her uncle's farm. But fret not, for he soon meets Charlotte, a large grey spider with an impeccable vocabulary.
 
It is truly the beginning of a beautiful and unforgettable friendship. 

I know this is a childhood favorite for many readers, but I was introduced to these characters not through the book, but by the 1973 animated film.



Because of this, I will always associate Paul Lynde's memorably snarky voice with Templeton the rat.


""What's in it for meeee?""

I should be ashamed to admit that I didn't read the book until 2011, but I'm not. I think I appreciated it more fully as an aging adult than I would have as a kid. Having lost some friends and both parents, I know how fleeting life can be and how important it is to grab onto every last experience and memory. How strange that it is the wisdom of a spider that reminds us of what matters most in our lives.

No pig ever had truer friends, and he realized that friendship is one of the most satisfying things in the world.

Adding to the joy of the book are the sweet illustrations by Garth Williams.





So thank you, Mr. White, for your most marvelous book. I can think of no other author who could make an arachnophobe like me shed tears over the death of a spider."
1205,Sean Barrs,Brave New World,"Oct 02, 2018",5,"‚ÄúBut I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.‚Äù 



These are words uttered in the face of tyranny and complete oppression, though they are very rare words to be spoken or even thought of in this world because every human passion and sense of creativity is repressed and eradicated through a long and complex process of conditioning.

And that‚Äôs what makes this novel so powerful; it‚Äôs not unbelievable. Like Orwell‚Äôs 1984 and Atwood‚Äôs The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale,  there‚Äôs just enough truth within Brave New World for it to be real. It‚Äôs a cruel mirroring of our own existence, should we follow a certain path too strongly. And that's the wonder of speculative fiction, though unlike the other two books, there‚Äôs no violence involved in Huxley‚Äôs world. It‚Äôs just as controlling and scary, but it‚Äôs done in a more indirect way. 

Sex is on tap, everybody should be happy.

People don‚Äôt go missing in the night nor are they stoned to death by a group of their peers, but they have just as little freedom (even if they don‚Äôt realise it.) In this dystopia they are trained from birth to think and feel in a certain way, and, for whatever reason, should they ever deviate from their ordained path, they are fed drugs that induce happiness and serenity; thus, the populace is kept within their desired space, and persist with the tasks they were born to do. Very few of them even consider that this is wrong; this is all they have known. And to make things even more maniacally clever, all physical and sexual needs are fulfilled completely as everybody belongs to everybody else in every sense with the ultimate goal of people never developing desire. All desire should be fulfilled, nobody wants for anything else. 

People are machines and houses are factories. They are mass produced and designed to be one thing and one thing only. All values are inverted. The idea of showing any emotion is horrific and repulsive. Love is unknown and alien. Death is associated with sweetness and relief. Children are fed candy when they are thought about death, so they associate the two together, so when as adults they see death they think of treats rather than the loss of someone they have known and worked beside for years. 

In Brave New World people are husks, empty and detached, without ever realising it.


-John, the savage, as he enters the new world

I can only admire and praise Huxley‚Äôs genius through the writing. Like all effective dystopian societies, reading and information plays an exceedingly important role. As with Ray Bradbury'sFahrenheit 451, all books have been destroyed and made inaccessible. John, one of the few characters who was born away from the new world, stumbles across a volume of Shakespeare and it changes his life. He can only think and feel in Shakespearean language and begins to view the world through a semi-romantic lens and only finds depravity when he walks into the new world. 

It‚Äôs everything he hates. He has been termed the savage, though he knows and understands the real meaning of the term even if those who call him such do not. Naturally, he becomes depressed and isolated in this new space, a space that he cannot be a part of or accepted in (not that he would want to be.) And I found him by far the most interesting and compelling character within the story because he is the only one to really look beyond the boundaries of his own experience and to find it wanting. 

So this is a terribly important novel and I can‚Äôt believe I have only just read it. If you haven‚Äôt read it already, you know what you have to do. This isn‚Äôt something to be missed. It‚Äôs a novel that made me think and imagine in a way a book hasn‚Äôt done in quite some time.

I always have second thoughts about ultra popular YA novels ( I haven‚Äôt forgotten my worst experience with Fault in our stars. Yes, I‚Äôm one of the haters of the book and double haters of the movie!)

So as a precaution I preferred to watch its movie when it was released a few years ago( safe choice and I didn‚Äôt need to worry about the adaptation part because the author was also screenwriter and director of the movie!) And yes, the author has one of the most brilliant minds to choose the best ensemble cast ( Logan-Emma and Ezra were magnificent! ) And watching vampire Paul Rudd( the man never ages) as literature teacher Mr. Anderson tripled my enjoyment. 

Now I decided to read the book but of course this will be a little limited experience for me because when I start my reading I always visualize my own cast decisions and match with the characters but the author already gave me the best acting list thanks to his outstanding movie. 

This is kind of you hate it deeply or you love it wholeheartedly novel. 

Firstly you have to be open minded about the term of being wallflower. It is not easy to keep your head above the water and not to be drawn when you decide to swim at high school ocean. 

Being wallflower could be a decision: if you are already introvert and suffered from a tragic past, the best way to survive against the sharks is being unnoticeable, ghost, shadow! So it‚Äôs easy to connect with Charlie and respect his decision, being witnessed his remarkable change when he is befriended by Sam and Patrick. 

It‚Äôs a heart wrenching but also realistic story about friendship, mental health, abuse, self discovery, standing for yourself and your loved ones. 

Not a five star read for me but it‚Äôs still meaningful, thought provoking, heartfelt story that I mostly enjoyed."

THE END"
1210,[ J o ],Memoirs of a Geisha,"Jun 20, 2016",1,"Read as part of The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.

There's nothing positive about this book, so let's just go straight in to why it was so bad.

The narrative was unbelievable. And I don't mean ""OMGA DID YOU SEE THAT?"" kind of unbelievable, I mean it was so unconvincing it was dire. At not point did it feel like a woman, a Geisha, a girl, a human being was telling me a story. It felt so flat and boring and my gosh, she was tedious. She had the emotional range of an egg.

The world description was non-existent. The beginning, when we are in the Japanese countryside, was the only part that was descriptive: we had a lovely house and lovely scenery, and then we moved to Tokyo and all of a sudden it's just grey and stone, and that's it. And oddly empty of people. No atmosphere, no city scenery; it was vague at best. It could have still been happening in the fish factory.

There also needs to be an amendment to the Bechdel Test. 3.1: Two women have a conversation about something that isn't just bitching about other women.

And, whilst I don't agree that ""culture"" automatically means you forgive something, and I realise it was a different time and a different place, but I don't want to read about creepy old men who creep about pubic hair growing on twelve year olds' vaginas. I just don't.

And I know this is the most unhinged and incoherent review ever, but I also didn't find myself learning anything particular about Geisha. In fact, I'd agree with most other reviewers and say it was far too Westernised and almost Romanticised.

Fun Fact Amendment: All Geisha were originally men. Think about that.

1211,Kemper,Of Mice and Men,"Sep 22, 2007",5,"I needed a quick read because I stupidly forgot that the library would be closed yesterday for Veteran's Day. I'd exhausted my current supply, and I needed a short term fix to hold me until I could get some new product today. So I grabbed Of Mice and Men off the bookshelf last night.

And I'm glad I did because I'd somehow remembered that this was a depressing book. How wrong I was! Oh, sure there were some tense moments like when you think Lennie will accidently hurt Curley's wife in the barn. What a relief when George and Candy come in at the last minute and stop anything bad from happening! And isn't it nice that the scare changes both Curley and his wife so that they have a much better marriage and new appreciation for each other.

Plus, it leads to the great moment when Curley is so grateful that he fronts George, Lennie and Candy the money to finally buy the ranch of their dreams. Oh, and that last scene with George and Candy on the porch of their new home while Lennie tends the rabbits brought a tear to my eye.

What's that you say? I got the ending wrong? No, I'm quite certain this is what happened. No! Be quiet! I can't hear you! LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA"

Instead, I will simply say that I loved this book. I loved its characters. I loved its plot. And I loved the eloquent way in which Harper Lee wrote it. It made me laugh and it made me cry. Her words are real and her story is truth.

This book is one of the wisest, most finely crafted, pieces of prose fiction I have ever read.

1213,Orsodimondo,Dracula,"Mar 22, 2023",4,"NOSFERATU


‚ÄùNosferatu‚Äù di Murnau non √® stato il primo adattamento, ma √® stato il primo a lasciare un segno indelebile. Capolavoro del muto e dell‚Äôespressionismo tedesco. Murnau dovette modificare il titolo, i nomi dei personaggi (il Conte Dracula diventa il Conte Orlok, interpretato da Max Schreck) e i luoghi (da Londra a Wisborg) per problemi legati ai diritti legali dell'opera. Il regista fu comunque denunciato dagli eredi di Stoker; perse la causa per violazione del diritto d'autore e venne condannato a distruggere tutte le copie della pellicola. Tuttavia una copia ""clandestina"" fu salvata dallo stesso Murnau, e il film √® potuto sopravvivere e arrivare ai giorni nostri. La Prana-Film G.m.b.H., casa di produzione del film, fu costretta a dichiarare bancarotta in seguito alla causa con gli eredi di Stoker, in quanto fu obbligata a pagare il contenzioso sui diritti d'autore. Si √® ipotizzato poi che dietro lo pseudonimo di Max Schreck (""massimo orrore"" in tedesco) si celasse lo stesso Murnau, pesantemente truccato per interpretare il personaggio.

Uno dei romanzi gotici per eccellenza pubblicato (1897) quando il genere aveva gi√† dato il meglio di s√©, almeno in termini di quantit√†.

Lettura tardiva questa mia. Anche se ho avuto la lunga netta sensazione che si trattasse di rilettura: il riconoscimento, la sensazione ‚Äúio da qui sono gi√† passato‚Äù, mi ha accompagnato dalla prima all‚Äôultima delle quasi cinquecento pagine.
Ma forse s‚Äô√® trattato di immagini dedotte dai tanti film visti, chiss√†.


Splendido anche il remake di Werner Herzog del 1979. Indimenticabile Kinski ma ancora di pi√π Isabelle Adjani. Werner Herzog appare nella scena dello sdoganamento delle bare di Nosferatu: √® sua la mano del doganiere che ispeziona la terra nelle bare infestate dai topi. Secondo quanto dichiarato dallo stesso Herzog nel commento al film, contenuto nel DVD, nessun altro della troupe aveva il coraggio di toccare i topi.

Il vampiro viene da lontano. E visto che √® pressoch√© immortale, va lontano: sull‚Äôargomento consiglio fortemente lo studio di Tommaso Braccini, ricco documentato divertente e appassionante, che dimostra come prima del 1897, nascita di Dracula, i vampiri, prima ancora che pericolosi, fossero mostruosi, schifosi, perfino puzzolenti (fiato incluso), figure relegate al folklore popolare. 
Con Dracula ‚Äì e mai nome fu pi√π azzeccato e pi√π memorabile ‚Äì nasce il vampiro bel tenebroso, raffinato e aristocratico. Nasce l‚Äôevidente collegamento erotico tra vampiro che morde e succhia e bella fanciulla dalla carne tenera e la pelle immacolata: il vampiro entra solo se invitato, varca la soglia solo se desiderato. √à la preda, prima ancora del predatore, a reclamare il piacere della caccia, non viceversa.


Bela Lugosi √® Dracula nell‚Äôomonimo film del 1931 diretto da Tod Browning, forse l‚Äôadattamento pi√π celebre. Da critici e appassionati di cinema, l'interpretazione di Bela Lugosi del personaggio √® considerata quella l'interpretazione ""definitiva"" di Dracula. A causa della sua magnetica performance, Dracula divenne il ruolo caratteristico di Bela Lugosi, e rese il ""suo"" Dracula un'icona culturale, e l'attore stesso una leggenda del ciclo horror della Universal Pictures. Tuttavia, il ruolo di Dracula si sarebbe rivelato per Lugosi sia una benedizione sia una maledizione: nonostante il suo trascorso di interprete teatrale di successo in vari ruoli, dal momento che Lugosi indoss√≤ il mantello del vampiro, nonostante i suoi tentativi contrari, rimase per sempre ""imprigionato"" nel ruolo del conte Dracula. Lugosi venne sepolto, con indosso il mantello di Dracula, all'Holy Cross Cemetery di Culver City, in California. Contrariamente a quanto comunemente si crede, l'attore non lasci√≤ mai alcuna disposizione per essere sepolto con il mantello; il figlio Bela G. Lugosi ha confermato in numerose occasioni che lui e sua madre, Lillian, presero la decisione poich√© ritenevano che questa sarebbe stata la volont√† del defunto.

Dracula √® apparso quando il cinema muoveva i primi passi. E si √® subito dimostrato fonte preziosa per lo schermo: gi√† all‚Äôepoca del muto, indimenticabile e insuperabile il Nosferatu di Murnau.
L‚Äôerotismo del vampiro √® evidente nell‚Äôesilarante film di Polansky Dance of the Vampires, probabilmente pi√π noto come The Fearless Vampire Killers, da noi diventato Per favore non mordermi sul collo (1967), dove, un anno prima d‚Äôessere ammazzata, Sharon Tate dispiegava tutto il suo fascino femminile. E dove il vampiro, nella sua incarnazione pi√π giovane, assumeva anche erotismo omosessuale.
Il collegamento √® diventato ancora pi√π palese nella trasposizione cinematografica di Francis Ford Coppola, dove Dracula/Gary Oldman diventa oscuro oggetto di desiderio, somministratore di piacere prima ancora che immortalit√†.


Altri celebri vampiri dello schermo: Tom Cruise e Brad Pitt in ‚ÄúIntervista col vampiro‚Äù di Neil Jordan (1994) tratto da un romanzo di Anne Rice.

Le tre donne avevano tutte denti bianchissimi, che splendevano come perle nel contrasto con il rosso rubino delle loro labbra voluttuose. C‚Äôera qualcosa in esse che mi metteva a disagio, qualcosa che era molto attraente e contemporaneamente terribilmente spaventoso. In cuor mio provavo un peccaminoso e bruciante desiderio che esse mi baciassero con quelle labbra rosse
Ma si sa che le rosse labbra voluttuose che incastonano denti bianchissimi sono pi√π interessate al collo che alle labbra. Il collo √® la fonte del piacere che cercano.


Altri celebri vampiri dello schermo: il mio amatissimo Bill Nighy nella saga cinematografica ‚ÄúUnderworld‚Äù.

Poi, certo, il vampiro √® la parte nascosta di ciascuno di noi, il nostro Mr Hyde: per quale altro motivo lo specchio non riflette la presenza del vampiro se non perch√© il vampiro √® dentro di noi, non fuori?
Poi, ancora, il conte Dracula viene dalla Transilvania, il confine tra l‚Äôest e l‚Äôovest europeo. Ma, forzando la mano, anche la porta verso l‚ÄôOriente tout court. E quindi la tenacia e persistenza con la quale Dracula vuole acquartierarsi a Londra testimonia quanto l‚ÄôOriente abbia voglia di invadere l‚ÄôOccidente, bene o male, allora come oggi, ritenuto culla della vera civilt√† (a fine Ottocento il Regno Unito era alla sua massima espansione, controllava quasi un quarto del globo).


Altri celebri vampiri dello schermo: Robert Pattinson √® il vampiro nella saga cinematografica ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù adattata dalla serie di romanzi di Stephanie Meyer.

Attraverso il diario di viaggio di Jonathan, il carteggio Mina-Lucy, lettere varie, diari, articoli di giornale (di lunghezza improbabile a meno che il quotidiano fosse a tema unico), promemoria, referti medici, telegrammi, registrazioni fonografiche, appunti stenografici, giornali di bordo (cio√® di navigazione, scritti alquanto improbabilmente da persona in procinto di essere uccisa): cambiano i narratori, il testimone non viene mai passato a Dracula, ma la storia raccontata √® proprio la sua.


Altri celebri vampiri dello schermo: Wesley Snipes nella saga ‚ÄúBlade‚Äù tratta dalla serie di fumetti Marvel. Blade √® mezzo vampiro, figlio di vampiro e di un‚Äôumana: in casa Bonelli lo chiamerebbero Dampyr, il miglior cacciatore di vampiri, il peggior nemico dei vampiri.

Sono numerosi i passaggi che trovo indimenticabili: Dracula che scivola lungo i muri esterni del castello come una veloce ‚Äúlumaca‚Äù; la nave che entra nel porto (di Whitby) governata dal capitano morto che si √® legato al timone (quasi novello cristo); Lucy, la prima vittima descritta, √® donna, bianca, giovane, e affetta da sonnambulismo, anche lei come il vampiro di notte si trasforma; la lunga lenta trasformazione da umana a vampira, non-morta; l‚Äôincontro tra la coppia sposata innamoratissima, lei ormai vampiro; come si elimina un vampiro (paletto piantato nel cuore, classico ‚Äì con sorpresa, anche testa tagliata e bocca riempita d‚Äôaglio)‚Ä¶


Gary Oldman √® il Dracula di Coppola qui nella versione ag√©e.

Tra gli aspetti, invece, che ho trovato funzionare meno metterei un‚Äôeccessiva lunghezza non indispensabile; una tendenza alla ripetizione o ad allungare i tempi; l‚Äôeccessiva enfasi specie se il racconto procede per diario o carteggio. 
Ma su tutti, l‚Äôassurdo modo di parlare inglese del professor Van Helsing che affatica la lettura e rimane alquanto incomprensibile, sia perch√© l‚Äôuomo √® dotto e con grande scibile, sia perch√© notoriamente gli olandesi parlano l‚Äôinglese magari con accento, ma senza errori. Ho pensato molto e spesso a Truman Capote nei panni di Lionel Twain in Murder By Death ‚Äì Invito a cena con delitto che corregge Peter Sellers nei panni del detective cinese Wang ricordandogli l‚Äôuso degli articoli e delle preposizioni articolate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znS3g...
Tutta la ‚Äúquestione olandese‚Äù lascia perplesso: sia l‚Äôaspetto linguistico che quello geografico (il prof viaggia tra Amsterdam e Londra o altri luoghi inglesi andata e ritorno in 24 ore, alquanto improbabile ‚Äì come incomprensibile rimangono i motivi che lo spingono a cos√¨ frequenti ritorni a casa).


Ma se Gary Dracula Oldman beve sangue fresco appare cos√¨ bel tenebroso. Nonostante Francis Ford abbia intitolato il suo film Dracula‚Äôs Bram Stoker, si prende molte libert√† rispetto al romanzo: non per niente, sostanzialmente il film di Coppola √® una sontuosa magnifica storia d‚Äôamore che attraversa oceani di tempo.

Come posso ‚Äì come potrebbe chiunque ‚Äì descrivere quella strana scena, la sua solennit√†, la sua tetraggine, la sua tristezza, il suo orrore e, insieme a tutto questo, la sua dolcezza?


Ma se lo attaccano e lo fanno arrabbiare il bel tenebroso diventa cos√¨.


Si √® cimentato anche Andy Warhol, anche se il titolo originale non √® ‚ÄúAndy Warhol‚Äôs Dracula‚Äù, ma ‚ÄúBlood for Dracula‚Äù, e la regia affidata al fido Paul Morrissey, e in scena c‚Äô√® il fido Joe Dallesandro. La storia √® ambientata in Italia, compare anche Vittorio De Sica, e la distribuzione italiana partor√¨ il geniale titolo di ‚ÄúDracula cerc√≤ sangue di vergine‚Ä¶ e mor√¨ di sete!!!‚Äù."

1215,Dan Schwent,Brave New World,"Dec 20, 2016",4,"In a dystopian society of genetically engineered consumers pacified by drugs and conditioning, Bernard Marx cannot seem to fit in. When he visits a Savage reservation, his eyes are opened and he brings one of the savages back to England with him...

As I continue my bleak science fiction parade toward the new year, I wonder why I've never read Brave New World before.

In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley takes on consumerism, the media, genetic engineering, recreational drugs, religion, herd mentality, individualism, and lots of other socially relevant topics, weaving them into a science fiction setting that our world resembles more every day.

The setting and society are the stars of the show in Brave New World. The people live in a caste system based on genetics, conditioned from birth and pacified by drugs, living to consume goods and take soma to forget their troubles. Free love is encouraged but free thinking is not. Bernard Max can't seem to get with the program and winds up nearly causing a revolution.

The characters are pretty secondary to the setting but it wasn't hard to feel sorry for Bernard, the square peg in a world of round holes. Even when he gets a measure of fame, he still can't manage to shake the feeling that something's wrong. John the Savage provides a nice contrast, an outsider looking in on a world everyone else sees as normal but he sees as hellish.

Huxley may not have thought so at the time but he may have been a futurist. Our culture seems to be moving in the direction of Brave New World all the time. The rampant consumerism, lowest common denominator entertainment, and herd mentality all seem a little too familiar. Is the internet our soma? Things to ponder...

There are some classics that are as hard to read as an insurance policy written in Klingon and then there are ones like this. Brave New World is very readable and not at all dense. The ideas are very easy to absorb, especially in this day and age. In these uncertain times, Brave New World is as timely as ever. Four and a half stars."

Rating: ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ¬æ

I feel like I'm going to get attacked for only rating a Harry Potter book 3.75 stars but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably my LEAST favorite of the series thus far. It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix.

On top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either.

Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned.

As for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more.

Overall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books."
1218,Shayantani,Of Mice and Men,"Jun 24, 2011",5,"‚ÄúTrouble with mice is you always kill 'em. ‚Äù

1219,Federico DN,Fahrenheit 451,"Jun 29, 2019",3,"A book, a flamethrower, and a very troubled mind.  

In a dystopian future, firemen don't put out fires... they start it. Books, and freethinkers, are burned with a flamethrower without a seconds thought. Guy Montag, one of these incendiary firemen, after a series of events starts awakening from his long and blind indoctrination. To his horror, he finds an identity and a mind of his own. But in a completely monitored and subjugated society, thinking can cost your life. One single mistake and Guy may find himself on the other side of the flamethrower...

A very short novel, with a lot of feel of Orwell's 1984. A novel that emphasizes the value of written legacy, books, and free will. An interesting read, with lots of moments and quotations to remember, but somewhat far from the dazzling 1984 experience.

What I couldn't grasp was Bradbury's confusing way to describe things, not because of the vocabulary, but because of the phrasing. Several of them seemed incomprehensible, or incoherent. Maybe I just got one of those weird faulty electronic copies. Or maybe this was just a book that I may have been able to enjoy much more reading it in spanish. Maybe. Might try Martian Chronicles someday, in spanish. 

**** Both movies fell kinda flat. Interesting, but not really enjoyable, and specially not 2018.
1966 - Definitely the most faithful to the book. Some important changes to the original plot, but welcomed ones. Unremarkable acting, at best. Decent effects, considering. Not necessarily a good film, but it does have some redeeming qualities.
2018 - It would be generous if said it has any redeeming qualities. Terribly unfaithful to the book. Besides the names, setting and *some* basic plot, everything else was changed. And not in a good way. Really nice effects though.

 Un libro, un lanzallamas, y una mente muy perturbada.  

En un futuro dist√≥pico, los bomberos no apagan incendios... sino que los inician. Los libros, y los librepensadores, son quemados con lanzallamas sin mediar palabra. Guy Montag, uno de estos bomberos incendiarios, tras una serie de eventos empieza a despertar de su largo y ciego adoctrinamiento. Para su horror, encuentra una identidad y pensamiento propio. Pero en una sociedad completamente vigilada y subyugada, pensar puede costar la vida. Un simple error y Guy podr√≠a encontrarse del otro lado del lanzallamas...

Una novela muy corta, con mucho feel de 1984 de Orwell. Una novela que resalta el valor de los libros, el legado de la palabra, y del pensamiento libre. Una lectura interesante, con varias citas y momentos para el recuerdo, pero algo lejos de la genial experiencia que fue leer 1984.

Lo que no pude digerir es la forma enrevesada que tiene Bradbury para describir las cosas. Reiteradas frases me resultaron incoherentes o irrelevantes. Tal vez me top√© con una de esas raras malas copias digitales. O quiz√°s √©ste sea uno de esos libros que tal vez hubiera podido disfrutar mucho m√°s ley√©ndolo en espa√±ol. Tal vez. Intentar√© con Cr√≥nicas Marcianas alg√∫n d√≠a, en espa√±ol. 

**** Ambas peliculas me cayeron sosas. Interesantes, pero no muy disfrutables, especialmente no 2018.
1966 - Definitivamente la m√°s fiel al libro. Algunos cambios importantes a la trama original, pero bien recibidos. Actuaci√≥n regular, como mucho. Efectos decentes, considerando. No necesariamente una buena pel√≠cula, pero tiene algunas buenas cualidades.
2018 - Ser√≠a generoso decir que tiene alguna buena cualidad. Terriblemente infiel al esp√≠ritu del libro. Aparte de los nombres, contexto y *algo* de la trama original, todo fue cambiado. Y no de una buena manera. Muy buenos efectos, eso s√≠.

1220,Steven  Godin,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Apr 20, 2018",4,"Many years ago I was told this is one of those books you have to read before you die. I didn't get far on that occasion, but returned recently with steely determination to have a second bite at the cherry (or should that be banana), to see if it really lives up to all the hype. Well, I certainly don't think I would take this as one of my few novels after being dumped on a desert island, nor would I have a special place on my bookshelf, and take it out every now and then to scrape moss from the cover and shoo away any unwanted lizards from within the pages, but yes, I am glad to have read it.

My fifth Marquez book had what I would come to expect in terms of magical realism, but through all the death, violence, and weird happenings, I found many of the characters still attached to real life situations, dealing with love, loss and war that had real consequences. I also found it darker in places than what I expected, but then again, what did I expect?. This is Marquez after all, and he sprung many a surprise on me. Mostly all good.

The names though, Ggggrrrrr!!!!! where was my copy of the family tree?, I bloody well could have done with one. Took much wrangling with the old grey matter to figure out just who is who's son/daughter etc...but just about got there. The narrative is a magician's trick in which memory and prophecy, illusion and reality are mixed and often made to look the same. How does one describe the techniques and themes of the book without making it sound absurdly complicated, labored and almost impossible to read. Though concocted of quirks, ancient mysteries, family secrets and peculiar contradictions, it makes sense that it doesn't always make sense but that's what gives the pleasure in dozens of little and immediate ways. The book is a prognostic history, not of governments or of formal institutions of the sort which keeps public records, but of a people who, like the earliest descendants of mankind are best understood in terms of their relationship to a single family. In a sense, Jos√© and Ursula are the only two characters in the story, and all their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are variations on their strengths and weaknesses. Jos√©, forever fascinated by the unknown, takes up project after project, invention after invention, in order among other things, to make gold, discover the ocean and photograph God. He eventually goes mad, smashes things, refuses to speak except in Latin and is tied to a giant chestnut tree in the middle of the family garden. A mixture of obsessive idealism and durable practicality informs the lives of the Buend√≠a descendants. The males, all named Arcadio or Aureliano, go off to sea, lead revolutions, follow gypsies, fall disastrously in love with their sisters and aunts (except one who develops a passion for a 12-year-old-girl) but most of them add to the family's stature and wealth and all contribute generously to its number. The women are not overshadowed by the men, one feature I found most welcome, and the bizarre events including eating dirt through depression, burning hands in the wake of suicide, and sending an innocent beauty to heaven with the family sheets left for never a dull moment. 

M√°rquez creates a continuum, a web of connections and relationships. However bizarre or grotesque some particulars may be, the larger effect is one of great gusto and good humor and, even more, of sanity and compassion. The author seems to be letting his people half-dream and half-remember their own story and what is best, he is wise enough not to offer excuses for the way they do it. No excuse is really necessary. For Macondo is no never-never land. Its inhabitants do suffer, grow old and die, but in their own way. It is a South American Genesis, an earthy piece of enchantment and so much more. It might have been just another phase in the incestuous life of Macondo, like the 32 revolutions or the insomnia plague, but enchantment and solitude cannot survive the gringos any more than they can avoid the 20th century. 

The novel is packed full of political commentary on real-life events and there are several reminders of the tangible material world, we can say that the misogyny and violence don‚Äôt matter because none of it is real? depends how you interpret M√°rquez, the one thing I found to be the novels strongest assets were that he offers plenty of reflections on loneliness and the passing of time, the caustic commentary on the evils of war, and a warm appreciation for familial bonds. Through all the magical and strange tidings Garc√≠a M√°rquez has urgent things to say, about the world, about us.

It didn't all work for me structurally, and I still prefer the shorter writings of 'Innocent Erendira and Other Stories' as my favourite M√°rquez to date, but it's easy to see why for so many this remains such a cherished novel throughout the world."
1221,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Apr 02, 2020",5,Your quest for one of the best books ever published will end here. The story of the Buendia family is narrated in one of the best ways we have ever seen by M√°rquez. The magical realism in it is simply spectacular and is the best I have seen in any book.
1222,Henry Avila,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass,"Feb 11, 2018",4,"Dreams , figments of the wondrous mind, what things can it create...A little girl named Alice, 7 with her big sister a few years older, sitting on the banks of the gentle river Thames, on a calm , warm sunny day, in 1862 how delightful , still she is bored watching her sibling read a book, not paying any attention to her, with no pictures, imagine that... getting sleepy...Out of nowhere a nervous White Rabbit dashes by Alice, no big deal even though it has clothes on, not thinking it peculiar when the animal speaks, looking at a watch, and declares he will be late to an important party. Intrigued the child follows the rapid rabbit down a large hole, a long tunnel , soon finding a precipice, then falling and falling, the never ending drop continues as the frightened girl starts to believe, maybe, quite possible , arrive finally on the other side of the world, welcome Australia.

If you are a type of person who relishes the road less traveled, this will be up your alley. A classic children's fable that will always be a favorite, having sold more than 100 million copies, and adults can be entrapped also, and benefit by the amusing satire of their foibles, which everyone has.That is being human ..."

1224,,,,,
1225,Matt,The Help,"Jul 03, 2017",5,"Kathryn Stockett has created this wonderful story that depicts life in America‚Äôs South during the early 1960s. A mix of humour and social justice, the reader is faced with a powerful piece on which to ponder while remaining highly entertained. In Jackson, Mississippi, the years leading up to the Civil Rights Movement presented a time where colour was a strong dividing line between classes. Black women spent much of their time serving as hired help and raising young white children, while their mommas were playing ‚ÄòSociety Lady‚Äô as best they could. Eugenia ‚ÄúSkeeter‚Äù Phelan may have been part of the clique, born with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she held herself on the periphery, at times looking in. Skeeter was unwed and with few prospects, though her time away at college left her ready to tackle the workforce until an eligible man swept her off her feet. Skeeter returned to Jackson, only to find her family‚Äôs help left under mysterious circumstances and no one was willing to discuss it. Skeeter sought a job as a writer, prepared to begin at the bottom rung, but not giving up on sleuthing around to determine what might have been going on in Jackson. Skeeter scored a job writing an informative column in the local newspaper, giving cleaning tips to housewives in need of a little guidance. Who better to offer these tips that the hired help of Jackson?! Skeeter fostered a slow friendship with one, while building up a trust, and has an idea for a book that could offer a unique perspective in Mississippi‚Äôs divided society. Skeeter sought to write a tell-all from the perspective of the hired help, in hopes of shining a light on the ongoing domestic slavery taking place within a ‚Äòfreed‚Äô America. With secret meetings taking place after working hours and Skeeter typing away, a mental shift took place and the idea of class became taboo, at least to some. Full of confessions and struggles in Mississippi society, Skeeter‚Äôs book may just tear the fabric of what has been a clearly demarcated community since after the Civil War. However, sometimes a book has unforeseen consequences, turning the tables on everyone and forcing tough decisions to be made. Stockett pulls no punches in the presentation, fanning the flames of racial and class divisions, as she depicts a way of thinking that was not only accepted, but completely sanctioned. A must-read for anyone ready to face some of the treatment undertaken in the name of ‚Äòsocietal norms‚Äô, Stockett tells it like it was‚Ä¶ and perhaps even still is!

Race relations in the United States has long been an issue written about, both in literature and pieces of non-fiction. How a country as prosperous as America could still sanction the mistreatment of a large portion of its citizens a century after fighting a war on the issue remains completely baffling. While Stockett focusses her attention on Mississippi, the conscious reader will understand that this sort of treatment was far from isolated to the state. One might venture to say that racism continued on a worldwide scale, creating a stir, while many played the role of ostriches and denied anything was going on. The characters within the book presented a wonderful mix of society dames and household help, each with their own issues that were extremely important. The characters bring stereotypes to life in an effort to fuel a raging fire while offering dichotomous perspectives. The interactions between the various characters worked perfectly, depicting each group as isolated and yet fully integrated. The household help bring the struggle of the double work day (triple, at times) while the society dames grasp to keep Mississippi from turning too quickly towards integration and equality, which they feel will be the end of all normalcy. Using various narrative perspectives, the characters become multi-dimensional. Additionally, peppering the dialogue with colloquial phraseology pulls the story to a new level of reality, one that is lost in strict textbook presentation. Stockett pushes the narrative into those uncomfortable places the reader hopes to keep locked in the pages of history, pushing the story to the forefront and requiring a synthesising of ideas and emotions. This discomfort is the only way the reader will see where things were, likely in a hope not to repeat some of history‚Äôs worst moments in America‚Äôs development. However, even fifty years after the book‚Äôs setting, there remains a pall of colour and class division promulgating on city streets. While racism is not as sanctioned in as many laws, it remains a strong odour and one that cannot simply be washed away by speaking a few words. This book, as entertaining as it is in sections, is far from fictional in its depiction of the world. The sooner the reader comes to see that, the faster change can occur. All lives matter, if we put in the effort and have the presence of mind to listen rather than rule from our own ivory towers.

Kudos, Madam Stockett for this wonderful piece. I am happy to have completed a buddy read on this subject and return to read what was a wonderful cinematic presentation.

1226,She-who-must-not-be-named,The Book Thief,"Apr 27, 2020",4,"Solid plot? Check
Strong emotions? Check.
Resolute characters? Check.
Compelling narration? Double check. 

The writing engrossed me. The concept of death narrating the story was eloquently put forward. Often, when you have very high expectations from a book, you may end up getting disappointed. But this book proved to be quite the opposite and I loved it immensely.

The story follows a nine-year-old girl called Liesel Meminger who along with her brother Werner, given up by her mother, is taken to a small town called Molching to live with Hans and Rosa Hubermann prior to the events of World War II. During the journey, Werner dies due to mysterious reasons, possibly poverty and poor health and Liesel sets off to bury him. That is when she steals her first book, even though she does not know how to read and it's only the first of what is going to be a series of thefts. She gets accustomed to her foster parents' house despite having nightmares about her dead brother, and eventually learns to read. Her obsession with books intensifies as war closes in and air raids begin- depriving her of people she's grown to love profoundly.

The book exemplifies the power of words, how they can be beautiful yet exceedingly soul shattering. Liesel is illiterate when she was first taken in, but as she continues to explore the world of reading, she begins to comprehend the impact Hitler's propaganda has and how he is the reason behind her parents' death.

   ""I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.""  
 
She realises how manipulative words can be and tries to right them by writing for commiseration.

Overall, The Book Thief is a poignant and a heart rending tale and it's a surprise I'm still lucid. I rate this book five stars ‚ú®"
1227,Stacy,The Fault in Our Stars,"May 08, 2012",1,"I had never read a John Green novel prior to reading this one. I wanted very much to like it and felt certain after reading some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here that it would be an awesome and heartbreaking experience. I was ready and excited. I guess I could sum the experience up best by stating that it is unlikely I will read another book by this author, and if I do it will be sometime in the future when I forget how utterly disappointing I found this book to be.¬†

I had a lot of problems with this book. Overall, it felt very insincere and I was constantly distracted by how obviously everything was written with the goal of tugging on the reader's heart strings, rather than just letting things happen that were beautiful in spite of being sad. It felt like Mr. Green was screaming at me from the page 'ARE YOU SAD YET? YOU'RE SAD RIGHT? THIS IS SAD. YOU SHOULD FEEL ALL THE THINGS AND CRY ABOUT IT. I'M A GOOD WRITER. I WRITE FEELINGS. ARE YOU CRYING YET?' For a story about Human Beings, it doesn't feel very human at all. Instead everything feels very unnatural and self-conscious in the worst way.

The biggest and most impossible thing for me to get around was I simply didn't believe the character of Augustus or his relationship with main character Hazel. As these concepts ¬†are basically what the entire story hinges upon, I didn't believe in or care about anything else that happened either. Augustus came off completely pretentious and obnoxious, particularly in the way he insisted on speaking in a Diablo Cody nerd hipster sort of dialect that no one would ever use in the real world. (Some commenters here have said it's the way Mr. Green himself talks which, a.) way to be self-congratulatory, and b.) how does he not get punched in the face, like, ALL THE TIME?) His entire character felt contrived and I never once felt a connection with him. Too often it seemed like he was walking around like I AM SO CLEVER LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME, constantly putting on a show so that nothing from him felt genuine or real. His whole fascination with ultimately meaningless metaphors felt condescending, like Mr. Green constantly squealing HEY GUYS, SEE WHAT I DID THERE? TAKE A SECOND, WRITE IT DOWN IF YOU NEED TO. YEAH, I'M DEEP. Augustus' one fault was sickness, but it was nothing that he could control. And that's just so... boring.

But it wasn't just Augustus. The character of Hazel was somewhat likable, (despite Mr. Green's insistance on making her 'sound like a teenager' by formating every other statement she makes like it's a question? and tacking distracting 'or whatever's onto the end of random bits of dialogue BECAUSE THIS IS HOW TEENAGERS TALK RIGHT? I CAN TALK LIKE A TEENAGER, SEE? BECAUSE THEY SAY 'WHATEVER'. I'M A GOOD WRITER. ARE YOU FEELING THINGS YET?) but her relationship with Augustus felt completely and totally forced. There was never any real reason for them to fall in love with one another, and that is crossing dangerously close into Twilight territory. He was so convienient, so effortless for Hazel. I had to wonder, was it him or was it because he was there and ready and willing? It all fell flat and left so many places to take the stories and facets of their characters completely unexplored. Any opportunities to delve into hard questions and real answers were left untaken and exchanged for large passages (mainly in the **SPOLIER ALERT**: Amsterdam trip scenes) that had very little purpose outside of screaming LOOK AT THIS HANDSOME CHARMING BOY ISN'T HE SWEET LADIES? HE WILL PULL YOUR CHAIR OUT FOR YOU AND HE TALKS LIKE I DO. IT'S CHARMING, RIGHT? YOU ARE FEELING CHARMED. I'M A GOOD WRITER.¬†

Ultimately, it felt completely fake. I couldn't get lost in it, always fully aware of the fact that I was reading fiction and how irritating EVERYTHING about it was. I finished it, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars, but it was a true task. Truthfully, it pissed me off. I would have loved to love this book as much as everyone else and have a new favorite to hold dear to my heart. Now I'm just confused. Was my copy broken?"
1228,Melanie,Wuthering Heights,"Feb 03, 2019",2,"‚ÄúPeople feel with their hearts, Ellen, and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him.‚Äù


Okay, I know that Wuthering Heights is so many people‚Äôs favorite book of all-time, and so many people‚Äôs least favorite book of all-time, so I went into this not really knowing what to expect. I will be honest, I didn‚Äôt really love it, but I was for sure not expecting the wild ride that this story took me on. I just truly found all of the characters (Except for Ellen/Nelly) to be so damn insufferable. 

But this is a story set in 1801, about a man named Mr. Lockwood, staying the night at Wuthering Heights. He meets a man named Heathcliff, who seems absolutely miserable, and he meets a housekeeper named Ellen Dean who will eventually help us figure out why Heathcliff is so miserable. Oh, and when Lockwood goes to sleep that night, he is awoken by a ghost! He then tells Ellen this, and she promptly throws us back into a flashback, where she becomes the new narrator, and we get to see what went down at Wuthering Heights many years ago. 

Wuthering Heights, at its black heart, is a story all about abuse, and cycles of abuse, and how abuse can impact so many hearts and so many generations repeatedly. Abuse and cruelty truly breed violence, and Heathcliff and everyone he has been forced to interact with just showcase that theme over and over. Heathcliff was orphaned and taken in, but everyone reminds him that he constantly is an outsider. But this story focuses on him and the three young people he grew up alongside of, and they are all shitty in their own ways. 

‚ûΩ Heathcliff is shitty because he only cares for Catherine. 
‚ûΩ Isabelle is shitty because she only cares about Heathcliff. 
‚ûΩ Edgar is shitty because he doesn‚Äôt care about his sister. 
‚ûΩ Catherine is shitty because she only cares about herself. 



‚ÄúWhatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.‚Äù


And friends, it is a truly wild ride seeing these characters interact with one another. And we eventually get to see their children who (you guessed it) are shitty, too! Again, cycles of abandonment and abuse is truly heartbreaking in every aspect. 

I don‚Äôt want to say too much more without spoiling, because I really do think the twists are pretty decent in this and figuring out more about the ghost was a big highlight for me. Also, the atmosphere was phenomenal, and the Yorkshire moors truly set a beautiful stage for this dark tale. And I feel like this is a little bit of an unpopular opinion; but I actually really liked Emily‚Äôs prose, too. 

I do want to say that upon finishing this story, I immediately started to look up things about the entire Bront√´ family, and my heart just broke. The things that those sister, and their entire family, had to go through. I know 2019 is kind of a dumpster fire, but I am so thankful that I wasn‚Äôt born in the 1800s, good Lord. Also, reading about how closely tuberculosis impacted this story and Emily‚Äôs life truly fucked me up, especially because I‚Äôm close to Emily‚Äôs age when she died. Seriously, I have so much love and respect in my heart for these three sisters, originally writing their dark tales under male pseudonyms, who will now never be forgotten. 

Overall, even though I didn‚Äôt love this story, this book was enjoyable enough to read. But you‚Äôre never going to find me romanticism anything that Heathcliff did. But I truly couldn‚Äôt wait to find out what happened next to all these insufferable characters. And I still firmly believe that Ellen/Nelly deserves the entire world. Also, I had the biggest giggle while reading about someone throwing hot applesauce at someone else, because like, just imagine that.

1229,Lisa,The Secret Garden,"Jun 25, 2014",5,"‚ÄúTwo worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own way - or always to have it.‚Äù 

As a child, I read this book at least four or five times, along with Frances Hodgson Burnett's other childhood stories about Sarah Crewe (Little Princess) and Cedric (Lord Fauntleroy). They represented a rite of passage for me as a person and as a reader. There is magic involved in coming-of-age stories where children strive to find the kind of life they are meant to live, against all odds, and I felt deeply satisfied each time I closed one of those books, knowing that the protagonists had (once again) made it through various challenges to live a better, more natural and fulfilled life.

So far, so good. 

Some childhood classics are better left alone later, signifying a certain phase that can only be ""demystified"" by rereading, leading to bitter disappointment and loss of the initial enchantment. I hadn't touched The Secret Garden for decades, as I feared the slightly exaggerated, dramatised plot might put me off, and destroy the magic of my memory. 

But then I happened to discuss a phenomenon among students in a wealthy, over-privileged area. Many children and teenagers appear phlegmatic, angry, frustrated, lacking initiative to learn and develop, and they demand unreasonable attention without showing any willingness to commit to tasks themselves. We could not make sense of it, seeing that these students had ""everything they needed, and more"", and met with no restrictions or boundaries from their parents. Shouldn't they be happy? But they aren't. They are among the most neurotic, anxious children I have ever met.

That's when The Secret Garden came to my mind again, - an early case study of childhood neglect in wealthy environments, in which children's physical and material needs are met, but their psychological development is completely left untouched. In The Secret Garden, it is the poor, but well-raised and deeply loved local boy who shows the spoiled, unhappy upper class children how to take on a responsible role for their life, and how to make active and positive decisions rather than throwing fits to let others step in and take over.

Children need boundaries, and nurturing, and meaningful connections to their surroundings. If they are treated with fear and submission, they will turn into tyrants to see how far they can go before they receive some kind of direct attention, negative or positive. If they are handled with too much severity, they will duck and hide, and develop chameleon-like survival strategies. To create a happy, mature, and responsible human being, a balance between rights and duties must be struck, with limits the child knows it cannot overstep without facing consequences, and with areas of creative experimentation, where future freedom of choice can be safely practised.

Just like a flower in a garden, a child needs both space, time and air, and a lot of nurturing, to blossom. I am grateful for the connection I found between my childhood reading pleasure and the everyday worries I face in my profession. A smile, a word of encouragement, a nudge in the right direction, all the small signs that show students that their teachers believe in their power to achieve great things - that's the magic of everyday life. And giving in to their tantrums is not helping those sensitive plants grow. It is stifling their development. 

When they claim they are too ""tired"" or ""bored"" to read The Secret Garden, and prefer to watch a movie version (if at all), they are in more dire need of overcoming the obstacle of long-term under-stimulation than the protagonists of the story itself. They need to be trained to love reading just like the two unhappy children in the mansion needed to be trained to show interest and care for the garden. 

Responsibility and care are acquired skills!"
1230,Joel,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Oct 21, 2009",4,"Lots of people have already read this book, and it's pretty much universally acclaimed, so it probably doesn't really need another review. So I just want to point out one thing that bothered me both times I read it (with a decade at least in-between at that):

Isn't it weird how much time the kids in this book spend naked? The entire time Ender is at Battle School, Card constantly tells us how everyone is always sleeping naked, or walking around the barracks naked or jogging naked. And one of the major fight sequences happens in the shower, and Ender's opponent strips down beforehand so they can both be naked. And did I mention that the genders are mixed (if mostly male) and the oldest character in the book is 12?

I don't know, maybe it's just me. It's not like I'm offended, it's just odd and a little distracting. Don't kids have shame in the future?

This review brought to you by the word ""naked.""

Oh and I also meant to put in something about how this book predicted so much of the way politics and the internet would evolve and intertwine, and the emergence of blogging as a platform where any one person can rise to international attention through a democratized communications forum.

1233,She-who-must-not-be-named,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Dec 07, 2019",4,""" One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,
Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls."" 


There are very few books that make me feel a tempest of emotions: make me happy and proud at one moment and break my heart in the next; make me chuckle at a few scenes and leave me in tears later, make me love a few characters and hate the others- and this is one such book.

The novel focuses on the life of two Afghan women-Mariam and Laila who come from different walks of life. 
Laila enjoys her school life, and is absorbed by the thoughts of her crush Tariq. She's beautiful, confident, smart, strong and playful.
 Mariam, on the the other hand is the illegitimate daughter of a businessman  Jalil . She faces a lot of social problems and rejection but she is headstrong and the real  hero  of the story.  
About Jalil well, I had a lot of mixed opinions: marrying Mariam off to Rasheed made me feel disgusted, but the (view spoiler)[ emotional letter he wrote at the last  (hide spoiler)] took me by surprise.

The characters in the book struggle for their survival in a harsh and obstinate society: They are wounded due to wars, relationships get tough and abusive, their property is destroyed; despite all this, they stick together, which is something I admired. But the  best  part about this book is the way Mariam and Laila show relentless pursuit and resilience and face all obstacles, especially considering how women are treated in their place- it filled me with pride and I was in love with their headstrongness. 

I was hooked, right from the first chapter. This book was pretty much like a rollercoaster- I felt a surge of emotions- anger, remorse and joy coursing through my veins with every passing chapter and I kept turning the pages to know more and before I had an inkling about it, I was done. The story was enticing, the narration was flawless, each chapter had a twist so intriguing I was compelled to read it multiple times.

My heart beat fast reading about he struggles faced my Mariam and Laila and the ending just got so heartbreaking I was almost in tears. I have humongous respect for Khaled Hosseini and I'm looking forward to reading more of his books."
1234,Sean Barrs,The Great Gatsby,"May 03, 2018",3,"This is a good book, though it is so ridiculously overrated. 

There are so many great books out there that will never get the attention they deserve. They will be forgotten and their wisdom heard by only a select few who are willing to go looking for it. So it annoys me when books like this are acclaimed by critics and readers alike as the best pieces of fiction in existence (when they are not.) There‚Äôs so much more out there!

Anyway, rant over. The thing I like most about The Great Gatsby is the language, the subtlety‚Äôs and the suggestions, the things that are not directly said but are said nevertheless. It‚Äôs a true feat of writing and at times it reminded me of a stage piece. The dialogue does not give the answers, but it is the character‚Äôs actions and movements (so fantastically narrated) that give the game away: it reveals their internal worlds. 

As such this is a book that can easily be skimmed over. The plot is basic and relatively unengaging and consequently I think an inattentive reader has a lot to miss here. It‚Äôs all about illusions and false appearances just like real life. The way people perceive us is not how we truly are and sometimes individuals actively work towards creating a desired appearance for the outside world. It‚Äôs easily done with enough time, effort and money. What Gatsby creates for the outside is a dream, an ideal life that looks perfect.

However, scratch the surface and it is so very, very, clear that not everything is perfect. His supposed ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù is hollow and dictated by the whims of society. It is fickle, egotistical and driven by status and all the silly little symbols that go with it. His success is what society demands success to be; thus, he positions himself into a place where he can chase his true dream. In doing so Gatsby shows us that not everything is as simple as it appears, and that society driven by such monetary values is a dangerous thing because everybody is so detached from what really matters in life. (The object of his affections, for example.) 

I enjoyed The Great Gatsby though I certainly did not love it. Its popularity baffles me to a degree, I can think of books from the same era that deserve far more attention. Still, I enjoyed reading it and I‚Äôm glad I finally did so.

1235,Anne,Romeo and Juliet,"Nov 15, 2008",4,"THIS! 
This is what happens when you jump into a rebound relationship with both feet.
So, when the story opens, Romeo is desperately in love with Rosaline. But since she won't give up the booty has sworn to remain chaste, he's all depressed and heartbroken. 
Annoying emo style.

 

His friends, tired of his constant whining, give him a Beyonc√© mixtape. 
He takes her words to heart, and her lyrics begin to mend his broken soul. 



His boys drag his sad ass to a party, and across a crowded room, Romeo spies his next victim...er, his really-really for real this time True Love.



Meet 13 year old Juliet. 
Who is 13.



And how old is Romeo? Well, he's old enough to kill Juliet's cousin in a sword fight, so...yeah. Probably not 13. 
But since he's such a punk little pussy - what with the whining, sobbing, and spouting off crap poetry - I'm going to assume he's not much older than she is and say 15 or 16. 
If I'm wrong, don't correct me. It'll help me sleep tonight.

 

Tragically, Juliet is a Hatfield, and Romeo is a McCoy. Their families have been feuding over a McCoy pig that was killed during a Hatfield moonshine run decades ago. Totally true. I swear.
Needless to say, tensions are still running high. 
So. Shhhhh. They gotta keep their love on the down low.
And it is love, dammit! I mean, they've stared at each other a whole bunch, and had like two conversations. 



This time around, Romeo isn't going to make the same mistake as before, and let the new girl of his dreams slip through his fingers...
Fuck, yeah! Time to get married!
Because marriage will solve all your problems. No, really.
Pinkie promise!



And we all know what happened next, right?!



Well...Ish.
You know, I can't help but wonder what that first encounter would've been like if they'd met when they were older?

Romeo: Hey baby, Heaven must be missing an angel. Mind if I crawl up to your balcony tonight?



Juliet: The fuck?! 



*taser crackles...Romeo screams*

Anyhoo, this isn't a romance, it's a cautionary tale. 
And a pretty funny one at that! I originally gave it 3 stars, but I had to bump it up for making me giggle so much. Between Romeo & Juliet both crying, moping, and twirling around like tweenage girls and the rest of the cast flailing around to accommodate these idiots, this was waaaaaay better than I remembered it.



I listened to this on Playaway, so I got to have the audio version with a full cast of characters, sound effects, and music. Loved it! Totally recommend going this way if you're planning on trying out Shakespeare."
1236,Werner,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Sep 16, 2017",5,"Back in the early 70s, I encountered this wonderful series through the first of the books to be written, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. (Below, I quote most of my review of that book, insofar as it applies to the whole series). I subsequently discovered the whole series, and in the 90s read it to my wife, who loved it as much as I do. We didn't read it in this omnibus edition, but as individual books; and for a long time, I intended to eventually review each book separately. But since the series has so much commonality, I decided that reviewing it as a single entity is more practical.

Note: This omnibus volume lists the seven books of the series in their internal chronological order, starting with The Magician's Nephew, which describes Aslan's creation of Narnia; and this is the order in which Lewis himself recommended that they be read. Barb and I, however, read and experienced the series in the order in which the books were written. Lewis fans debate which order is preferable, and I can see both sides of that. Usually, my preference is to read a series in internal chronological order. But the way that we read this one probably provides for more of a feeling of resonance in the later ones, as certain things that were mysterious before fall into place later.

Most people know that C. S. Lewis was an effective Christian nonfiction apologist, using the tools of reason and logic to build the philosophical case for Christian faith. But he ultimately became convinced that an even more effective apologetic is available through the ""truth of art,"" the instinctive and emotional appeal that stories exert -- especially the kinds of stories that draw on the deep, mythical archetypes of fantasy to illuminate the real universe. The Chronicles of Narnia, his classic fantasy series, was the fruit of that discovery, set in Narnia, a magical land whose world lies in another universe, in which magic works and time moves differently than it does here, and in which Christ is incarnate as the great talking lion Aslan. The first book of the series presents one of the most powerful symbolic literary presentations of the Christian gospel ever written. Although the intended audience, in Lewis' mind, was children (and his various direct addresses to the readers as author presuppose this), there is nothing invidiously ""juvenile"" about the quality of the writing; it can be enthusiastically appreciated by anyone who loves tales of imagination and adventure, fantasy and wonder; and the truths here, like those in Jesus' parables, are simple enough to speak to children but profound enough to challenge adults.

The Christian message is an essential part of all of the books in the Narnia series. We all react to fiction based partly on how we feel about the message(s) it conveys, and that's appropriate. So readers whose view of Christianity, or of religion in general, is highly negative could hardly be expected to give the Narnia series unqualified praise. (The converse applies, of course, to books like the His Dark Materials series by Philip Pullman, who avowedly seeks to be the ""anti-Lewis;"" it isn't surprising that his work is less appreciated by readers who hold a very negative view of militant atheism.) That's a subjective assessment, and fair enough as such. Some other criticisms of Lewis' series, though, are intended to be more objective, and can be debated objectively. (This discussion might contain some ""spoilers."")

One reviewer states that the series ""has no real conflicts"" because Aslan can exercise miraculous power to resolve them. But if this is so, then the theistic view of real life is that it has no real conflicts either, since God has miraculous power to resolve them. But no theists that I'm aware of view real life in that way, least of all Lewis, as his other writings indicate (and insights from all of his writings are valuable in interpreting the Narnia books, since his thought was highly unified). As his writings on miracles make clear, he believed that God can intervene in the natural order miraculously --but doesn't do so very often, because intervening on a wholesale basis would negate the predictability of natural law (and leave us unable to recognize a miracle when one did happen!) And, very importantly, God doesn't make people's choices for them; they exercise free will, which requires that their choices have meaningful consequences --good or bad. So in Narnia, as in the real world, Aslan doesn't intervene very often; and most readers observe quite a bit of conflict. Bad things happen, and they aren't always deserved; evil isn't automatically and instantly punished; and good characters suffer and inevitably die, some well before their time. And characters experience a good deal of conflict in struggling to decide on the right course of action --or on whether or not to do what they think is right, when all the rewards would appear to gained by doing wrong. In one of the books, Eustace is indeed changed back from dragon to boy --but only after he learns a lesson about the value of human friendship; and that doesn't come easily to him. And in the first book, yes, Aslan will be resurrected after giving his life for Edmund --but his death is still an awful experience that he undergoes for someone whose welfare, viewed from a coldly objective standpoint, is nothing to him; most of us wouldn't undergo it, even with the guarantee of resurrection.

Like most non-vegetarians, Lewis views eating of meat as appropriate when the meat is that of a non- rational, nonthinking creature; eating a being who can speak is cannibalism, no matter what that being looks like. Whether or not one regards that as a significant distinction, or how significant it's seen as being, is a matter of opinion; but it is a genuine distinction between humans and, for instance, cattle.

Probably the most significant criticism here is the accusation of ethnocentrism and racism in the portrayal of the Calormen. Calormen are darker in color than Narnians; their culture differs from the Narnian one; and their government is a despotic empire that would like to add Narnia to its domains. (Neither Narnian nor Calormen culture are identical with any culture in our world, though like all fantasy writers Lewis uses this world's cultures as a grab-bag from which he can pull various features. Calormen is mostly desert, but its polity is much more Turkish than ""Arab-like,"" and the idolatrous cult of Tash doesn't resemble Islam.) Some readers assume that any mention of dark skin means that the people so depicted have to be racially inferior; that race and culture are the same thing, with the former dictating the features of the latter, and that the character of a government mirrors the character of a people; and that if Narnia and Calormen's governments tend to be hostile and suspicious toward each other, that must mean that everything Narnian is good and everything Calormen is evil. But there are good reasons to think that Lewis didn't share these assumptions, nor want to convey them.

Two of the most sympathetic and positively treated characters in the series are the Calormenes Aravis and Emeth. Aravis is a strong, gutsy and capable heroine; she winds up marrying Prince Cor, and their son grows up to be Archenland's greatest king. And Emeth (whose name, not coincidentally, is the word for ""truth"" in Hebrew) is readily welcomed by Aslan into heaven, having amply demonstrated his moral worth. This certainly suggests that Lewis judges, and wants his readers to judge, Calormenes ""not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."" It's also instructive that a character in That Hideous Strength, Lord Feverstone, advocates ""liquidation of the backward races"" --but he's a spokesman for the anything-but-nice N.I.C.E., whose social program represents everything Lewis detested.

In the latter novel, closer to the end, Lewis lays out a theory of human cultures in which all of them, at their best and truest, are unique and distinct embodiments of moral and social truth, making a kind of truly multicultural mosaic in which the differences are respected and appreciated. This idea is reflected in The Last Battle, where Aslan's true country is made up of the Platonic ideal of every created country --including Calormen, where Lucy sees the towers of the true Tashbaan. So Calormen's cultural differences from Narnia can be viewed in this light --there is no reason to think Lewis' view of ""shoes turned up at the toe, scimitars, suffixed phrases of praise, 'son-of' lineage declarations"" was ""unfavorable."" The latter are found in the Bible (a book Lewis certainly viewed favorably!), and some of his writings suggest that he rather liked stately formal courtesy in social interactions. He contrasts the Calormen oral story-telling tradition favorably with English teaching practices; and if Calormen culture is called ""cruel"" in one place (which, Lewis would say, is a deformation caused by sin), it's also called ""wise."" Finally, King Miraz and his gang --who are all white-- aren't viewed as any more benevolent than the Calormen Tisroc and his toadies; the actions of both are due, not to race and nationality, but to the common experience of human fallenness.

This is far and away one of my favorite fantasy series. I'd highly recommend it for any readers who appreciate imaginative literature, and I believe most would find it both intensely entertaining and thought-provoking."

1238,karen,A Game of Thrones ,"Jul 29, 2011",5,"yup.
nerds, now i am among you.

this is going to be a review where i just prattle on and on about meee meee meee, because let's face it - there are a million reviews of this puppy out there so i don't have to worry about doing a disservice to the book. you'll either read the book or you won't. but you should: it's got direwolves.

i wasn't going to read this. after years of watching hordes of desperate sad-eyed nerds coming up to me, asking ""any news on the george r.r. martin release??"" (like the bn computer knows more, somehow, than the internet. it doesn't) and i would have to tell them (not without some schadenfreude-glee) ""nope - it has just been moved back another year!!"" it gave me a solid sense of ""there but for the grace..."" like when you see a very young junkie and you congratulate yourself for dodging that particular bullet.

despite what i kept hearing about how awesome the books were, i just filed it away in the mental RA folder of ""stuff nerds like"" and figured one day i would read them, you know - for research, but not before they were all out - i wasn't going to get sucked into the trap of so many before me - the waiting game of disappointment and having to reread the older books again and again to keep track of who was even alive at this point. ""when you play the game of thrones, you play to become frustrated and impatient.""

i have seen it a hundred times.

so when the teevee show came out and people were drooling over how good it was, i paid them no mind. i pushed it two feet past the ""someday"" pile in my brain. because i am not one of those people who watch a movie before reading the book, am i??

but connor wore me down. he really wanted me to see it and he wanted to talk to me about it and his bearded little face was all lit from within with enthusiasm and i just couldn't say no to him.

so i did it. i watched the teeveee. on demand - several episodes in a row, pissed off if i started to get too sleepy to make it through another episode.

so so good.

so now, i had to read it, right? i owe it to the gods of fine literature and all.

so i did, and god this book is fun.

i am glad they changed a few things for the filmed version - i'm not sure i would have been too comfortable watching a thirteen-year-old actress play daenerys. 

in the same line of thought - natalie - i know you have not watched the show yet, but your crush on jon snow?? perfectly understandable to someone watching the show - he has that dark brooding thing i can see a girl going for, but if you have only read the books?? girl, your crush is on a fourteen-year-old boy. i have notified the authorities, you perv.

in the end, i am glad i watched the show first, if only so that i know how to pronounce the characters' names. oh, you crazy high fantasy novels and your names...

alfonso won't read this series because of the incest and because they never tell you where the soldiers pooped. i am not kidding. several people complain that the seasonal imbalance complicates the growing cycle and where is all their food coming from. this point i can understand - fantasy novels are supposed to care about developing a fully-realized world and all, and that is kind of a major detail, but it doesn't bother me at all. i am no connoisseur of fantasy- i am a dilettante at best. so i don't care where people are getting their food - i don't care if the social hierarchy is a realistic one, given the particulars of this realm, i certainly don't care where the soldiers are pooping. nor do i care in any novel where and when the characters poop. i just like this book's quiet intrigues and betrayals. the diplomacy, the lack of hesitation when it is time for a character to be killed off. i love how there aren't any ""good guys"" or ""bad guys,"" only ""effective"" and ""ineffective"" characters. every one of them does at least one thing that'll make a reader go, ""oh, bad move."" so he dropped a few details when it comes to agriculture - he spent all his energies into creating characters that i love reading about.there are facets to this thing - sides of the argument rarely seen in a straight-ahead rollicking plot-driven novel. 

and i'm not really sure where the misogyny accusations come from. is it because women can't really ascend to power except through marriage?? because i don't think that was invented for this book - i am pretty sure that has happened, historically, in other places. and if it's the looting and raping, well - that happens in war, too. wait, is it sansa?? yeah, she's kind of a wash. but the girl wants what the girl wants. she's at least more complicated than bella, right? there are plenty of good characters here that aren't weak or power-mad, or just regular-mad... okay - there are a couple. but sheeeeit - all the characters here are pretty bad, on the moral spectrum, right? littlefinger is my very favorite, but i wouldn't want to know him in my real life. i appreciate his devotion, though.

so i am super excited about clash of kings, both the book i will read and the show i will watch. swords and boobies and direwolves. i don't even know how i am going to make it until then.

oh, because i was talking about boobies and HBO just there, connor was telling me this story about louis ck, and i loved it, and i found this quote. it is relevant!! hbo is nudity-crazy!! but he took care of their lust for flesh:

HBO was asking us why there was no nudity on the show, and what they really meant was, Why wasn‚Äôt Pamela Adlon, who played my wife, nude? When I hired Pam, I didn‚Äôt tell her she was going to be doing anything like that. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be that kind of show. So I said, ‚ÄúYou know what, I‚Äôll do it.‚Äù And I did that episode, and they were like, ‚ÄúO.K., we have plenty of nudity, thank you.‚Äù

hbo, thwarted!

This story is timeless.

Simply beautiful."
1241,Fabian,Gone with the Wind,"Jul 01, 2011",5,"I‚Äôve said it some time ago: GWTW the novel is like watching the ten hour director‚Äôs cut of GWTW the movie! Hell yeah! All the memorable scenes are there, & the spotlit romance is considerably widened in scope, as is the sturdy social studies lesson on the almighty American Civil War. I mean, everyone has the basic idea correct: the South took a tremendous thrashing. But having the loser‚Äôs POV take the forefront, even to the extent of exalting the KKK-- this, more than Scarlett O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs infamous bitchiness but overall fierceness as the antihero of this fantastic tale-- is what I fell in love with. The stars all aligned and for the first time in a long time the general reading audience had it correct. GWTW is a remarkable, unique reading experience.

A reader simply isn‚Äôt one unless he or she has faced a behemoth like this one. This, ""The Odyssey,"" ""The 1001 Arabian Nights,"" ""Don Quixote,"" ""Lord of the Rings""... are all Musts. All epic & so awesome, THE primordial blockbusters of their time. You have enough time to live with the book, to form a relationship with it, to think about your future together... (It becomes an integral part of yourself‚Ä¶) 

Now, what do we get on this journey that is sadly missing in its technicolored, titanic doppelganger? The atrocities shown here of the war are not apt for a rated G film. 

The following questions are thoroughly answered... (mild SPOILER ALERT!) In what way did Gerald O'Hara gain ownership of Tara? What invisible connection exists between women and horses? How did the siege of Atlanta take place? Why Atlanta? What is Southern hospitality, really? (Priceless is the mentioning of several ostentatious Atlanta parties with only the Yankee army 22 miles away‚Ä¶! Priceless is the POV of the woman that stayed behind while all men are off to war‚Ä¶! Priceless the interconnections between folks [of course the world population was nil back then!]) And, How has the idea of masculinity changed from the 19th century? What is true sisterhood? What's Post-traumatic stress syndrome?

The townships are fully described. GWTW has many protagonists, as they all add authenticity to the incredibly narrative. If there ever existed a valentine for a city in the elusive form of an epic historical romance, then it is this, for Atlanta! There are additional love stories which parallel Rhett‚Äôs and Scarlett‚Äôs & several romantic dates between the central lovers. Everyone, it seems, has fallen in love, which adds the hues of Romanticism to the epic Southern Myth. Too, there is sympathy for the devil, scorn for the overly dandified Yankees (They desecrated graves! Raped, and pillaged!), amazement at the aftereffects of the Civil War, including Reconstruction (which takes up many more pages than the war itself!). 

Missing from the silver screen? The characters of Wade and Ella, Scarlett‚Äôs first- and second-borns. They do nothing but highlight the main character‚Äôs flaws and selfishness. Frank Kennedy, also known as Mr. Scarlett O‚ÄôHara, the Second. And Will Benteen, the overseer at Tara would be one too many males within Scarlett‚Äôs (Vivien Leigh‚Äôs) periphery on film. Also: Scarlett almost getting attacked and raped; GWTW‚Äôs racy social commentary, all of the men partaking in early KKK activities. I will admit, GWTW is gee-wow! oh-so feminist... but also downright racist!

Scarlett‚Äôs consciousness evolves. She turns from spoiled brat teen to fiery, materialistic bitch!! In her brain is the constant battle to get Ashley Wilkes, to get Tara. It is only here that I perceive similarities to ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù: yearnings & adolescent ambivalence. These things, it seems, never change. Also, that Gotterdammerung, or, the dusk of the gods, the end of civilization, is apt to occur in our times, and soon: this is a prophecy waiting to be fulfilled‚Ä¶! 
 
The British have ‚ÄúWuthering Heights,‚Äù ‚ÄúPride and Prejudice; We got ‚ÄúGone With the Wind‚Äù, an epic so incredible, so full of wuthering heights and perplexing downfalls, so jam packed with southern pride and arrogance, of prejudice and passion, that it is simply sad that its sole detriment is (not its length, nor its melodrama, but) its racist edge. GWTW is the s**t in many respects, but it is the dialogue between the star-crossed lovers (positively Wilde in its cleverness, in its tongue-in-cheekness) which elevates it to a plane higher than its sturdy, more lauded colleagues. Unlike that once-glorious South in the war, with ‚ÄúGone With the Wind‚Äù you, the reader, will not lose...!"

1243,Maegen,The Help,"Aug 07, 2010",1,"While it was a well-written effort, I didn't find it as breathtaking as the rest of the world. It more or less rubbed me the wrong way. It reads like the musings of a white woman attempting to have an uncomfortable conversation, without really wanting to be uncomfortable. It's incredibly hard to write with integrity about race and be completely honest and vulnerable. The author failed to make me believe she was doing anything beyond a show & tell. And if her intent isn't anything greater, then it makes this book all the more pandering to the white imagination of what it must have been like to be ""the help"" during that era. It's passive self-reflection at best and utterly useless.

The national fascination with this book makes me sick. It makes me think of my grandmother who was ""the help"" to many white families for well over 50 years. Her stories aren't too different from those told in this book, but they are hers to tell. If she were alive today, I don't believe she would praise Stockett's book. In fact, I think she we would be horrified at the thought that her years of hard work (in some cases, for some very horrible people) would be reduced to some wannabe feel good story of the past."

1245,Cara,City of Bones ,"Jun 30, 2009",4,"Wow. I was reading some reviews on this and people either hate or love it. I am not ashamed to say I belong to the latter. Lots of opinions means there is lots of things to say...

Ok so I was practically splitting my head open thinking of what exactly I wanted to say about this book. In the end I just decided to go with what comes to mind. So here it goes...

Clare does a superb job of drawing you in. Maybe the plot isn't completely unique but the world she created is. I kept telling myself this is sooooooooooo interesting. The whole shadowhunter thing oozes with coolness. I mean half angel, half kick butt people! It doesn't get much cooler than that. The story is full of action and yes sometimes there are things added for dramatic effect, but isn't that the point? If you were looking for something more slow paced read The Mill on the Floss (personally I'd rather pull more hair then read this but moving on...)I'm a sucker for action sequences so this totally delivered on that front. The author's take on werewolves was original, and I gotta say they give the vampires a run for their money. I actually guessed most of the twists but that's some of the fun. Finding the hints and feeling the satisfaction of saying YES! Score for me I got it right! Let's do a little victory dance. (Insert some break dancing moves I personally cannot do here) I think some people didn't get that guessing the twists is all part of the experience.

Some people claimed all of this to be fluff but I don't agree. Just look at Jace. The whole feeling about belonging has depth to it. Now for why I knocked off a star even though I REALLY didn't want to. I thought Clary would be more shocked about finding out her history. You'd think with how much her mother pounded in to her that there was not such thing as magic she would resist the whole idea more. Also I think the author tried to introduce too many fantasy creatures at once. Like the scene at Magnus Bane house was overdone for my taste. We could have done without so many new faces. Those are just little irks though, my main one was Valentine. I know this is going to sound outrageous but Valentine wasn't bad enough for me. I shouldn't feel this way looking at his track record he is evil. The thing is I wasn't scared of him. A good villain has got to be scary plain and simple. I'm hoping to see more evilness in him in the next book.

Well I think I've said enough. I'm so glad I'm reading this series after all the books are out. I totally expect to be blown away by the next installment:)

1246,Lu√≠s,Crime e Castigo,"Jun 24, 2020",5,"How do we criticize such a monument? I dared not attack this prominent author for a long time, and then Santa Claus forced my hand; no regrets, on the contrary! Indeed, not only is the reading not tricky, but what depth?
Through the story of Raskolnikov, the narrator proposes to confront us with the moral contradictions that sometimes agitate us. For example, is murder still a crime? If we consider the victim's acts, can we assume that, in any case, she deserves life? And is it, not the fact of Great Men to take this decision for the common good? Here is the dilemma decided (with an axe) by Raskolnikoff, who wants to be an extraordinary destiny, and nothing seems to change his mind. However, his actions do not stop haunting him, and he might see a message from his subconscious. Since then, nothing can make him happy. He has lost his life by taking that of someone else. This fact raises the question of the rights that one can or not grant to oneself despite the law and morality (such as taking justice into oneself, for example) and, more generally, can be a death sentence.
Finally, the narrator offers us love, as a way of redemption. After all, the discovery of true love may restore the Humanity that his reason and actions had made him lose. It is a jewel of psychological, philosophical, and literary finesse and openness to introspection. To read and reread!"

 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland aka Alice in Wonderland 

How did Caroll get his ideas?
Many questions arose both around Carroll¬¥s alleged drug consumption and the mental state of the author and besides himself, nobody will ever know. But it has been used to argue for pro drug consumption by hippies, for damnation by all of their political and ideological opponents, and as part of 

The myth of how authors find inspiration
The idea of how the mental state of a writer, or artist in general, influences her/his works is even more fascinating, because the line between sane imagination and creativity and madness or getting lost in a world one created her/himself is thin. Just genetic luck or pure coincidence may make the difference between a world-building, ingenious, and very successful author superstar and severe, lifelong mental illness. Being in the zone and flow state of positive creative overkill or of uncontrollable mindfucks one really isn¬¥t into. Mental strength and self-discipline, to let the demons work for one instead of killing them, or a small pharmacological help may make the difference between world fame and mental asylum and completely blocking or losing the controllable and not harmful symptoms might destroy the ability to make such works, take away the needed basis of dreams, hallucinations, and loss of reality necessary to create unique works. A manifestation of how precious and fragile those human egos, fictional surrogates of what the brain wants, are.

One of the first comedic fantasy works with depth
At a time when there was close to no fantasy literature available, Carroll wrote a precursor of today's bizarro fiction/fantasy/ crossover/horror/comedic whatever genre, focussing on the hero¬¥s journey of one main plot with the strangeness and surreality of the other characters and environment as main driving engines.

 Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There 

Don¬¥t look behind the mirrors

Maybe a bit too strange
Because of the violence and weirdness, I wouldn¬¥t consider it as a clean, normal read for all ages anymore, but closer to the elder kid section. A true classic, having a lasting impact on pop culture and many other works and tinkering with the ideas of reality, consciousness, the layers of dimensions that might lie beyond the known three, and the realm of interpretations, connotations, and innuendos. 

More in it than in stereotypical standard classics
Because it is highly subjective, it is very difficult to draw the line between witty, hidden criticism and satire and simple plot devices with coincidental benefits, and just the author knows what the true intention was. But just that so many, big, clever, whatsoever generations of adults and parents are thinking about and puzzling around what hidden meanings might be behind that lovely story with beheadings, bipolar, schizophrenic, and generally prone to mental illness side characters, highly developed nanotech that let¬¥s one grow and shrink and stuff, differentiates it from other classics.

The extra easter goodie for the adult readers
One of the rare examples where timeless, all-devouring questions have been compressed and distilled to an allegedly benign, nice, little tale for the kiddies, but the deeper the interested adult digs, the further she/he explores the Matrix-style abyssal depths of the hidden human thoughts, fears, and imaginations, the bigger the WTF factor becomes.

Inspiration unknown
I don¬¥t know where Carroll took his ideas from and what inspired him to invent this tale, as for instance other pioneers of fantasy tended to use, steal, and adapt old mythology, but much of the content is just so bizarre that it can¬¥t be compared with the typical standards of the innocent (except the violence, opportunism, sexism, racism, extremism, and many other evil isms) old tales.

1248,Emily May,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Aug 29, 2012",4,"It was a warm, sunny day in Montenegro and I was about to set out on a boat trip. I felt certain that a combination of sightseeing and the people I was with would keep me from having much time to read, but I packed a book anyway just in case there was time for a chapter or two in between stops. 

A Thousand Splendid Suns happened to be that book. And at the end of the day, when I staggered off that boat, blinking at my sudden exposure to reality, it wasn't because I'd been mesmerised by the stunning architecture and history lessons, no, it was because Hosseini stomped all over my heart. I'm not even sure how I found enough hours in the day to take a boat trip around Montenegro and read this entire novel, but somehow I finished this in the few hours I had... simply because I had to.

My initial reaction was a furious, teary promise to myself that I would have to give this book five stars - I think it's impossible for the mind to win a battle with the heart in that level of heat, especially when you're used to English weather. But afterwards, I managed to reclaim some of my sense and sanity, which is when I finally began to acknowledge this book's limitations. 

For one thing, I think it's extremely generous to place this book in the ""literary fiction"" category. I am certainly no book snob (give me a delicious page-turner over some pretentious waffle any day) but I find myself comparing A Thousand Splendid Suns to another book about a country and culture I was only vaguely familiar with - The Poisonwood Bible - a book which I also read on my trip. The latter is a far more complex, ambitious work that brings something which, to me, felt entirely fresh and original. Hosseini's story, on the other hand, is not groundbreaking and I recognise many of the scenes and characters from other books.

What it is, however, is incredibly emotional, sad, uplifting, infuriating and memorable. It's lessons on the history of Afghanistan and the rise of the Taliban might be basic but they are nothing if not compelling. I came away feeling like I learned something. What I did learn was truly horrifying, it painted details into the very vague images I already had in my mind that I had gotten from various British newspapers. But I also really liked the affection for his birth country that shines through Hosseini's story; his faith in the ultimate goodness of these people who witnessed society and order crumbling around them.

The ultimate tragedy of this story, for me, is how everything could have been very different for Mariam and Laila if people had just acted a little faster, stopped worrying about their pride a little earlier, and trusted a little more. I really liked the range of emotions both women experienced and they way the author showed this. I know some readers thought it was wrong for Mariam to be jealous of Laila at first, but I actually really liked the complexity. Rasheed may be a bastard but he was the only thing in the world that she had at that point, and on some level it made sense to me that she would want to claim him for herself.

While I believe Mariam and Laila experienced complex emotions and were well-developed, Rasheed did not get the same treatment - a fact which I'm torn about. On the one hand, I think Rasheed would have been a better character if he'd been developed beyond him being the most villainous villain in all villaindom. On the other hand, I think Rasheed's evil personality offers an important distinction between him and Jalil (and the other men), one which is needed in a book that looks at the cruelties women suffer at the hands of men. 

The difference between Rasheed and Jalil is important. The latter is a man who acts badly because his behaviour is shaped by the society he lives in. Rasheed, on the other hand, is a mean and violent brute who completely abuses the power handed to him as a man in this society. These differences between Rasheed, Jalil and the other men (Tariq, Laila's dad, etc.) show there is not one type of man in this society, that wife-beating is not simply a part of the culture, that even in a patriarchal society you can choose what type of man you want to be.

I admit this is far from a perfect book, but it is a good book. It's a book that seems to swallow you whole but spit you back out in pieces. And, just to mention, I keep intending to read The Kite Runner again because I think studying it at school ruined it for me, but so far, I much prefer A Thousand Splendid Suns."

           Warning: Spoilery review. Short version: Hurry up and read this. 


Holy crap. Someone should have warned me about reading this book at work. I have been sitting here bawling my eyes out, tears streaming madly down my cheeks, flooding my eyes until the words swim into fields of glistening black lines. This book is so beautiful and anguishing to read I can't even be objective about it, because it was one of those stories that just burrowed a lot closer to home than you could ever feel comfortable with. Really, though, even objectively I have little to offer in the way of criticism. What was probably a nightmare of a book to write was woven together seamlessly, so beautifully constructed it seems more like a living, organic thing than an idea born inside someone's head. 

I liked the foreshadowing, I liked the intricacy, I liked that we never really know what Alba chooses in the future, whether she embraces the time travel or tries to stop it. I loved the poignant pain that begins to trickle across the pages as the pieces begin falling into place. I am curious to see how Clare and Alba's relationship developed once Henry was gone, but I was happy it was not in the story. That there are plenty of things for my imagination to fill in makes me happy. I also really liked the approach the author took to the paradox of time travel. It seemed the most plausible, unarguable position I've ever heard (and I have taken a class on it), though I have not allowed myself to think about it too hard as I have no wish, at least within the context of this book, to unravel how much sense it makes. 

What really hit me in the gut (seriously, I did not even cry this hard when I read ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" for the first time, and I got red-faced, puffy-eyed and ugly over that one), was the horrible feeling that I could see myself as Clare and know exactly how she felt about Henry, and could fill the unwritten pages of her future with grief that I would know and understand. I cannot imagine losing my husband. I cannot imagine ever having to face a day knowing that he was not there, and never would be again. No matter how much I would want to think that for his sake I would be strong, go on, live out my life with joy and accomplishment as he would have wanted, the truth is I would probably wind up just like Henry's father, a wasted, squandered creature who does not know how to exist alone without the sound of his laughter, the warmth of his arms around my body, the feel of his head resting against my chest, the drowsy murmur of ""I love you"" against my ear as we drift off to sleep, the domestic intimacy and companionship that accompanies the hiss of bacon frying in the skillet as he and I stand side by side fixing breakfast on Sunday mornings. I do not know who I would be without those things, but I would be someone unrecognizable from who I am now. 

This book is also listed on IMDB, which really excites me, as I think it could be a beautiful movie. Everything it needs to be good is right here in the book, and because of the manner of Henry's death, it even lacks the melodramatic twist that most dramas rely on, such as a car accident, an act of God, or something else outside of the character's control. No, there is culpability here, and that is an incredibly powerful thing. While it was not the purpose of this book to examine how Claire dealt with her father and brother after Henry's death, or how they dealt with themselves, it would have been so interesting to see. There's too much to like about this book, and something so real and raw and powerful about the sadness and grief it portrays. Incredible."

i want a mr. darcy, but this world is full with wickhams and collins, ugh."
1251,Bill Kerwin,1984,"May 28, 2007",5,"This book is far from perfect. Its characters lack depth, its rhetoric is sometimes didactic, its plot (well, half of it anyway) was lifted from Zumyatin‚Äôs We, and the lengthy Goldstein treatise shoved into the middle is a flaw which alters the structure of the novel like a scar disfigures a face.

But in the long run, all that does not matter, because George Orwell got it right.

Orwell, a socialist who fought against Franco, watched appalled as the great Soviet experiment was reduced to a totalitarian state, a repressive force equal in evil to Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. He came to realize that ideology in an authoritarian state is nothing but a distraction, a shiny thing made for the public to stare at. He came to realize that the point of control was more control, the point of torture was more torture, that the point of all their ""alternative facts"" was to fashion a world where people would no longer possess even a word for truth.

If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face ‚Äî forever. 

Orwell‚Äôs vision of the world is grim; too grim, some would argue, for it may deprive the faint-hearted among us of hope. But Orwell never wanted to take away hope. No, he wished to shock our hearts into resistance by showing us the authoritarian nightmare achieved: a monument of stasis, a tribute to surveillance and control.

Here, in the USA, in 2017, our would-be totalitarians are a long way from stasis. Right now they‚Äôre stirring up chaos and confusion, spreading lies and then denying they spread them, hoping to gaslight us into a muddle of helplessness and inactivity. They are trying to destroy a vigorous democracy, and they know it will take much chaos and confusion to bring that democracy down. They hate us most when we march together, when we occupy senate offices and jam the congressional switchboard, when we congregate in pubs and coffee houses and share our outrage and fear, for they know that freedom thrives on solidarity and resistance, and that solidarity and resistance engender love and hope. They much prefer it when we brood in solitude, despairing and alone.

Which reminds me...one of the things we should never do is brood about the enemy‚Äôs ideology (Is Steve Bannon a Fascist? A Nazi? A Stalinist?), for while we try to discern his ‚Äúideological goals,‚Äù the enemy is busy pulling on his boots, and his boots are made with hobnails, with heel irons, and equipped with toecaps of steel.

Finally, it does not matter who heads up the authoritarian state: a bully boy like Mussolini, a strutting coprophiliac like Hitler, a Napoleonic pig like Stalin, or a brainless dancing bear like Trump. Whatever the current incarnation of ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù may be, the goal is always the same:
A nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting - three hundred million people all with the same face."

Say what you will about the author, he wrote a fantastically empathetic book that works on so many damn levels. And this time, my daughter and I both bawled our eyes out together.

I'm so glad I can introduce her to a true love of SF. :)



Original review:

So nice to read it again. I suppose I can point to this book as being one of the very first to open my eyes to just how much can be accomplished in SF.

I mean, sure, I first read Chriton's Sphere right after King's Tommyknockers so I was feeling the love already, but Ender's Game set a new standard in readability, emotional impact, and sheer cussed F***ed-up-ness.

Since then, I've read over twenty novels that shared echoes of this novel. And yet, I keep coming back to this and its companion, Speaker for the Dead, glorying in the wonder of all these little pieces coming together in plots both interesting, tragic, and wonderful.

This is one of those rare cases where popularity is not unfounded. A great tale meets great acclaim. 

I can rank this up near Dune as one of my most beloved novels of all time. No question about it.

Do I pity Ender? Hell, yes. But more than that: 

I admire him."
1253,emma,Dracula,"Feb 20, 2017",4,"Another case of me starting a review with no idea how to rate it. This book was‚Ä¶a ride.

I think my professor put it best when he said, ‚ÄúDracula is either really good or really sh*tty.‚Äù Okay, yes, I‚Äôm paraphrasing, but only a little.

https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...

This book is quite a feat, either way. You can read essentially ANY THEME into this novel: good and evil, race, religion, gender, science, wealth, power, abstinence, war, colonization. More, probably, but it‚Äôs a Monday and I had four hours straight of math tonight and I‚Äôm sleeeeepy. Anyway, that all sounds peachy keen, right? Emma, I imagine you saying, what do you mean it could be shitty? Look at all those themes! It‚Äôs the great Irish novel, maybe! I know, imaginary reader. I hear ya. But there are things about this book that are even weirder than that quasi-sex scene. (The joke is that you can‚Äôt tell which one. There are a million symbolic moments of characters gettin‚Äô it on. Truly wild.)

BUT OKAY. It‚Äôs not just that there are a bajillion themes. Because that would be cool. No, it‚Äôs that you can make an argument for either side of every theme. Sexist or feminist; condemning religion or supporting it; racist or accepting; et cetera et cetera. The book is also straight up teeming with stuff like repetition that can either be thematically significant or just a bad job. (Can you imagine being the editor of this book? ‚ÄúUh, Bram?‚Ä¶Hey buddy. So, you use essentially the same passage describing Dracula‚Äôs powers three times in one chapter, so ‚Äì I was, you know, wondering ‚Äì are you a genius or a total dumbass?‚Äù If I achieve my dream of being an editor/publisher I‚Äôm only editing YA. Too scary.)

The upside of all this was that this book was such a blast to discuss in class. (A substantial f*cking improvement from slogging through boring old Huck Finn everyday for two weeks.) We would spend like an hour on a page, trying to discern sexism from feminism and desperately seeking homosexual overtones. (OH BOY DID WE FIND THEM, AND OH BOY DID WE LOVE DOING IT.) Anyway. In-depth textual analysis is like, my favorite thing.

This shindig was intermittently a blast (ohmygod! Vampires were fun even in 1897!) and soooo boring (ohmygod. What is up with plotlines from 1897). Still, I gotta give mad props to this book, because I read it EXCLUSIVELY by forcing myself through it in 110-page chunks in one work-study shift‚Ä¶and I still enjoyed it most of the time. That never happens! Sure as shit didn‚Äôt happen with Huck Finn.

The characters really sucked, but that happens a lot with classics. Weird that a handful of these endured, though. I won‚Äôt miss them even if I end up missing reading this. (It‚Äôs been a big part of my life for a while! Okay, like a couple weeks, but that‚Äôs a long time for me.)

But I do think this book is sexist, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs close to perfect, and there are creepy issues with consent and metaphoric sexual assault and gender roles, and I wanted to write a paper on this book being an allegory of the battle between science and religion (religion won, guys!) but was FORCED to write on gender, the most clich√©d topic of them all. Still, though, this book impressed me. (To clarify I wasn‚Äôt excited that religion won. I‚Äôm excited that said conclusion fit with my hypothetical essay.)

Bottom line: I think I liked this? I definitely recommend it. It‚Äôs cool to see what started (not actually but don‚Äôt @ me) all our cultural whatnot with vampires. (Still not that into them though. I say while technically currently reading some dumb book about them.)"

1255,Matthew,Anne of Green Gables ,"Jan 26, 2018",4,"This story is cute, touching, heart-warming, tear-jerking. In other words, a classic!

The target audience is definitely not me. I would say it would be perfect for a teenage girl living in Canada in the early 1900s. That makes sense, because that is exactly what Anne is! However, the point of this obvious detail is that sometimes it is fun to read a classic and try to put your mind in the mindset of who it was written for at the time. A couple of the storylines seemed silly or to not make sense, but if I stopped and changed my mindset, it would click.

A bit of a history lesson combined with a well written story. If you haven't read this before, give it a shot and maybe you will find your inner early 1900s Canadian teenager!"
1256,Jeffrey Keeten,Jane Eyre,"Jun 17, 2017",5,"‚Äú‚ÄòJane, be still; don't struggle so like a wild, frantic bird, that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.‚Äô
 
‚ÄòI am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you.‚Äô‚Äù
 
I am glad that in 1847 Charlotte Bronte made the decision to publish her novel under a male pseudonym. Currer Bell had a much better chance of being published than Charlotte Bronte and, with reviewers and readers assuming that she was in fact a male writer, allowed the novel a chance to be weighed properly without prejudice. Jane Eyre became a bestseller. The question is, of course, would the novel have been so successful or even published at all if CHARLOTTE BRONTE had been emblazoned on the cover? I like to think that some editor would have realized the bloody brilliance of the story and would have published it anyway, even if they didn‚Äôt spend any money on promoting it. Would readers have bought it? Hopefully, word would have trickled out about how compelling the plot was, and people would have overcome their natural prejudice for reading a novel by a woman. 
 
So isn‚Äôt it fun that Charlotte tricked everyone, including her own father? She did not confess her efforts to him until she had become successful. Even writing these words, I have a smile on my face thinking of this successful bamboozlement of publishers, editors, and readers. 
 
The story, of course, is larger than the book. Most people with any kind of inquisitive nature have been exposed to the bare bones of this novel without ever reading the book. Maybe they watched a movie based on the book, or maybe they have heard it referenced. Once read, it is impossible for people not to use aspects of this novel as common reference points for other readers. 
 
Take Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester himself, the master of Thornfield Hall. He is a brooding, complicated, dark, and intelligent creature. He is a force of nature who conforms the world around him with every stride he takes or every word that drops from his lips. He is the embodiment of the Lord Byron character. It doesn‚Äôt matter that he is not handsome. He is powerful. Women swoon in his presence and, after a carefully administered smelling salt, might start calculating what he is worth a year. 
 
Rochester is completely taken by Jane Eyre, practically from the moment they meet. The drama of their meeting is one of those great cinematic scenes in the history of literature. Bronte incorporates many scenes into the novel that are, frankly, gifts to future movie renditions. Rochester has never met anyone quite like her. He is not alone. Everyone who comes into contact with Jane Eyre knows they have met a unique person. She is a kind and pleasant person, but she will not brook any discriminations against her character. 
 
Mrs. Reed (her aunt), Mr. Brocklehurst (director of Lowood School attended by Jane), Mr. St John Eyre Rivers (minister who asks to marry her), and even Mr. Rochester, all attempt to conform Jane to the acceptable, deferring Victorian woman of the time. To call this a feminist novel does put it in a box which constrains it too tightly. Jane or Charlotte, either one, would loosen those bindings and let it breath as Charlotte‚Äôs intentions with this novel go well beyond the confines of any specific genre. I found her ideas of female equality, embodied so wonderfully in the character of Jane, inspiring. ‚ÄùWomen are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their effort, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer, and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.‚Äù
 
I hear you, Charlotte.
 
Can you imagine the impact of such words on your typical, Victorian housewife? A woman who has lived her whole life being the daughter of her father, the wife of her husband, the mother of her sons. She has been passed from the care of one man after another. If she were fortunate enough to be born pretty, she has that brief moment of power when suiters contend for her hand, but probably, ultimately, her father would decide who was best for her to marry. How about the impact of reading this novel on the typical, Victorian man? Did he look up from this book and peer over at his wife, she looking rosy in the firelight, knitting away at some frivolous thing, and think...does she want more? Or maybe he sees his pretty daughter enter the room on the verge of womanhood, and does he consider the possibility that she wants or deserves more? 
 
There is no spark of revolution inspired by this book, but I do hope that this book may have chipped away at some of the archaic ideas of inequality. Maybe a few women readers realized that some of those secret desires they have harbored their whole life were not such strange concepts. When Jane stands up to the conformists she encounters, she is willing to take the punishment because she knows in her soul that what she believes about herself is incontestable. 
 
This is no better illustrated than in her interactions with (I‚Äôm sorry to say this because it isn‚Äôt completely fair) the odious St. John Eyre Rivers. He wants to marry her but only for the sake that he believes she will make a wonderful, useful, missionary wife. He doesn‚Äôt love her. She is willing to go, but only as a ‚Äúsister,‚Äù not as a wife. Jane refuses to compromise, but there is this moment where she is teetering in the balance. I‚Äôm mentally screaming to her at this point. ‚ÄùI shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on my limbs.‚Äù He is a cold man who would have gladly marched OUR Jane off to some godforsaken part of the world to die some horrible death from disease or from simple neglect. 
 
I know the plot; and yet, I‚Äôm still completely invested in every scene. There is always the possibility that I‚Äôve fallen into an alternative universe and I am reading some other version of Jane Eyre with a completely different ending. I can assure everyone this did not happen.
 
When Jane is residing with Mrs. Read, she describes her place to sleep as a ‚Äúsmall closet.‚Äù I can‚Äôt help but think of the closet under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive. Like Harry Potter, she is also an orphan but still with a rebellious streak because she is also sure that she is supposed to be someone other than who she is currently perceived to be. The relief she experiences when she learns she is getting away from the condescending attitude of the Read house and going away to school at Lowood also reminds me of Harry‚Äôs relief to discover he, too, is escaping to Hogwarts. Though I must say Harry, despite the trials and tribulations he experiences, draws a better straw than Miss Jane. 
 
I really enjoyed the gothic elements; those were, to a degree, completely unexpected. ‚Äù‚ÄôOh sir, I never saw a face like it! It was a discoloured face--it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!‚Äô
 
‚ÄòGhost are usually pale, Jane.‚Äô
 
‚ÄòThis, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes. Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?‚Äô
 
‚ÄòYou may.‚Äô
 
‚ÄòOf the foul German spectre--the Vampyre.‚Äô‚Äù
 
There are noises in the night at Thornfield Hall. There is an unknown tenant locked away in the rafters of the house. There are secrets. There are unexpected fires. There are scandals waiting to be known. In fact, the twists of the plot were considered so outrageous for the time that the book acquired a reputation for being ‚Äúimproper.‚Äù This helped to boost sales further. 
 
The Bronte family was very close. They grew up conceiving their own stories and fantasies and acting them out in impromptu plays. All three girls and the brother, Branwell, were writers. Tragically, they all died young. Charlotte outlived them all, dying in 1855 at the age of 38 with her unborn child. Branwell (31) and Emily (30) both passed away in 1848, and Anne died the following year at the age of 29. Can you imagine having to bury all your siblings? It must have felt like the spectre of death was stalking the Brontes. 
 
What makes Rochester unique is that he does eventually see Jane the way she sees herself. ‚ÄùFair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of his eyes.‚Äù I will remember that line ‚Äùdesire of his eyes‚Äù for a long time. She is a hidden gem in rooms full of people. Charlotte Bronte makes some good points through Jane‚Äôs eyes at how unaware wealthy people are of the true natures of those who serve them. 
 
I would talk about the love story, but what is there to say. It is one for the ages. I would say that Charlotte Bronte never found her Rochester in real life, but some letters have come to light, written to a man named Constantin H√©ger, that suggests that maybe she did. He was married to someone else, and when Elizabeth Gaskell wrote the biography of her friend, she carefully edited out those very revealing letters of a love that could never be. 
 
Jane Eyre, may you always find the readers you deserve.

1257,leynes,Anne of Green Gables ,"Feb 10, 2022",5,"Anne of Green Gables is everything. I got interested in reading this book after hearing Ariel gush about it for years. And I initially wanted to save it for October (‚ÄúI'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.‚Äù ‚Äì duh) but I'm so glad that I didn't. I fell sick in February and was in the mood to read a cute children's book, which is why I picked up this book.

Anne of Green Gables recounts the adventures of Anne Shirley, an 11-year-old orphan girl, who is mistakenly sent to two middle-aged siblings, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, who had originally intended to adopt a boy to help them on their farm, Green Gables, in the fictional town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The novel recounts how Anne makes her way through life with the Cuthberts, in school, and within the town.

And yes, it's a story suitable for children but I feel like it hits closer to home as an adult. Much of its humor (and believe me, this book is HILARIOUS) would have been lost on me as a child. Also the intricate character dynamic of Anne and her new foster parents. I am really happy that I read it as an adult.
But really, Marilla, one can‚Äôt stay sad very long in such an interesting world, can one?
I feel like this book can be truly hit or miss for people, and it all hinges on whether or not you will take to Anne as a character. She's a child, 11 at the beginning of the book, 16 when it ends, so she is definitely annoying af at times, self-centered, oblivious to the problems of other people, she literally won't shut up and I'm positive that her dialogue makes up at least 60% of this novel. ;) So, she's not a character that just everyone will love. But if you do, you will fall head over heels in love with this book.

Anne of Green Gables is charming, hilarious, heart-warming, and gut-wrenching at the same time. I didn't expect to laugh out loud (for real, no hyperbole!) every other page. Every single joke landed with me. Montgomery's witty writing style, the banter, Anne's hilarious monologues and Marilla's unsympathetic responses, the little adventures and mishaps that Anne gets herself into on a daily basis ‚Äì it's all so wonderful.

This book feels like a spring morning, with the first sun in months on your skin, it tastes like your favorite apple pie, it smells like the ocean. I know I'm repeating myself but it is simply wonderful. I didn't expect to fall in love with Green Gables and its inhabitants as much as I did ‚Äì Anne, Matthew and Marilla will always have a place in my heart. As well as the other inhabitants of Avonlea, most notably Diana (who is a queen), Gilbert (who is everything), Mrs. Rachel Lynde (who is an icon!), and Miss Stacy (who is doing the Lord's work out here). I love all of them more than life itself.

Anne of Green Gables did not only make me laugh in ways I haven't laughed in a long time (at a book), it also made me cry, more like historically sob over the pages, so much so that they're wavy right now. Since I had read through the chapter titles before jumping into the story, I was pretty certain that something would happen at the end of the book that would completely wreck me. And yes, I was right. It happened. And it wrecked me. [I'm really happy that the show, ""Anne with an E"", took a different approach and didn't include that event in any of their three seasons. I would not have been able to handle it again.]

The only minor criticism I have of this novel is that it could've been 50-70 pages shorter. The first half was AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING ‚Äì like I said before, literally laughing out loud on every page ‚Äì but when Anne grew up, I felt like Montgomery could've told her story a little more tighter, as some of Anne's adventures and mishaps just started to feel repetitive and I wanted to see her character growth a bit earlier. 

Nonetheless, I still flew through this 400+ pages children's classic in four days ‚Äì whilst nursing a headache ‚Äì so it was still a true page-turner for me. I cannot wait to return to the world of Avonlea some day ‚Äì ya'll have convinced me to give the second and third book in the series a shot. I need to see more of my baby Gilbert!

Favorite/ notable moments: (spoilers ahead!)
‚Äì ‚ÄòIf Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo from Australia Mrs Rachel could not have been more astonished.‚Äô ‚Äì from the first chapter on I knew I was going to be in for a fun ride; Montgomery's wit and humor is unmatched and EXACTLY my cup of tea
‚Äì ‚ÄòShe was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all her might and main.‚Äô ‚Äì and from her first appearance, I fell in love with Anne Shirley
‚Äì Anne telling Matthew: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve never belonged to anybody ‚Äì not really.‚Äô
‚Äì ‚ÄòWill you please call me Cordelia?‚Äô she said eagerly. ‚ÄòCall you Cordelia! Is that your name?‚Äô ‚Äì Marilla was like WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON UP IN HERE???
‚Äì ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm in the depths of despair.‚Äô ‚Äì half of the humor is that Anne is so fucking extra, she's the most dramatic of children and her vocabulary is UNMATCHED
‚Äì ‚ÄòAnd when people mean to be good to you, you don‚Äôt mind very much when they‚Äôre not quite ‚Äì always.‚Äô ‚Äì I found it really interesting how differently Anne‚Äôs past abuse are portrayed in the book vs the show (""Anne with an E""), it's much more explicit in the show due to all the horrifying flashback scenes where we see Anne getting whipped by her former foster parents and bossed around, bullied and assaulted at the orphanage, the book is much less overt
‚Äì however, similarly to Harry Potter, it's pretty unrealistic that Anne got out of these horrifying situations without any mental issues or problems, just like Harry, she's basically the purest, most naive and even confident and self-assured child, and whilst I love that for her, it's not a realistic portrayal of how children who are abused/neglected FOR YEARS during their early childhood and teenage years feel and act 
‚Äì Marilla telling Anne: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt any use at all for little girls who aren‚Äôt neat.‚Äù was such a fucking low point, I love Marilla but especially in the beginning of the book she is highly manipulative and emotionally abusive towards Anne (by dangling the threat of not keeping her over her head constantly), it was hard to read
‚Äì However, it is worth of note that Marilla is the one shouldering most of the responsibility of Green Gables, therefore, she has to be the practical (harsher) one, whereas Matthew ‚Äì who comes across as more sympathetic ‚Äì can allow himself to keep his head in the clouds and indulge Anne's every whim (but only BECAUSE Marilla manages everything) 
‚Äì ‚ÄòI never say any prayers.‚Äô [‚Ä¶] Marilla decided that Anne‚Äôs religious training must be begun at once. Plainly there was no time to be lost. ‚Äì Marilla really was like WE BROUGHT A HEATHEN TO THIS HOUSE 
‚Äì ‚ÄòI‚Äôd love to call you Aunt Marilla,‚Äô said Anne wistfully. ‚Äì WHY IS SHE SO PURE? 
‚Äì After Mrs Rachel calls her ugly: ‚ÄòYou have hurt mine worse than they were ever hurt before even by Mrs Thomas intoxicated husband. And I‚Äôll never forgive your for it, never, never!‚Äô ‚Äì first of all, Rachel was an ass for that, but more notably, again, we get some hints at Anne's past abuse but nothing specific ... due to the fact that it's left to the imagination, one imagines the worst, but if Rachel calling her ugly is worse than anything Mr Thomas did, then it couldn't have been as bad as I first imagined (= sexual assault)
‚Äì ‚ÄòPuffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill, Marilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.‚Äô ‚Äì I love her more than life itself!
‚Äì When Anne and Marilla went to pay the Barrys a visit, so that Anne could be introduced to Diana, Mrs Barry asked: ‚ÄôHow are you?‚Äô And Anne replied: ‚ÄòI am well in body although considerably rumpled in spirit, thank you, ma‚Äôam,‚Äô said Anne gravely.
‚Äì ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from getting to the picnic. I suppose I‚Äôd live through it, but I‚Äôm certain it would be a lifelong sorrow.‚Äô ‚Äì ANNE HAS ZERO CHILL
‚Äì ‚ÄòI believe this child is crazy.‚Äô ‚Äì same, Marilla, SAME
‚Äì After Marilla forbids her to attend the picnic: ‚ÄòMy heart is broken. You‚Äôll feel remorse of conscience some day, I expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I forgive you.‚Äô
‚Äì Anne wishing she‚Äôd been the one who nearly drowned during the class trip instead of Jane Andrews ‚Äì LOL 
‚Äì Mr Phillips can suck my ass => whipping his students, humiliating them in front of the class, and let's not talk about the Prissy situation (PUKE) ... I love how they showed his true colors in the show!
‚Äì Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, ‚ÄòYou are sweet‚Äô, and slipped it under the curve of Anne‚Äôs arm. (HOW SWEET) Whereupon Anne arose, took the pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the floor, ground it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position without deigning to bestow a glance on Gilbert. (CAN SHE CHILL? NO? OH, OKAY.)
‚Äì After Diana‚Äôs mother forbids her to associate with Anne (due to the wine debacle) and the girls have to say their farewell: ‚ÄòTen minutes isn‚Äôt very long to say an eternal farewell. Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget me, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress thee?‚Äô 
‚Äì ‚ÄòDiana gave me a lock of her hair and I‚Äôm going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life. Please see that it is buried with me, for I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll live very long. Perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her Mrs Barry may feel remorse for what she has done and will let Diana come to my funeral.‚Äô ‚Äì I AM TELLING YOU SHE HAS NO CHILL 
‚Äì ‚ÄòMarilla, isn‚Äôt it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?‚Äô 
‚Äì Marilla literally being xenophobic, she literally hates all foreigners and only trust Canadians ??? (‚ÄòHow often have I told you never to let one of those Italians in the house! I don‚Äôt believe in encouraging them to come around at all.‚Äô OKAY KAREN) 
‚Äì In the sudden stab of fear that pierced to her very heart she realized what Anne had come to mean to her. => I really love Marilla's arc (in regards to Anne) though, she started out as this tough ""unfeeling"" woman and came to love her like her own daughter, BEAUTIFUL!
‚Äì ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd really want to be a sensible person, because they are so unromantic. Mrs Lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one‚Ä¶‚Äô ‚Äì Rachel telling it straight as it is 
‚Äì AUNT JOSEPHINE ... I loved her in the books already (her asking the girls to sent her more story? HOW PURE) but her take on the show (literally being a lesbian icon) was also refreshing
‚Äì Matthew telling Anne: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt give up all your romance‚Ä¶‚Äô I AM SOBBING‚Ä®
‚Äì ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs the worst of growing up, and I‚Äôm beginning to realize it. The things you wanted so much when you were a child don‚Äôt seem half so wonderful to you when you get them.‚Äô ‚Äì I didn't remember asking for a therapy session, hello?
‚Äì Gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem the sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed. => Anne, honey, I know you‚Äôre jealous but please stop shaming this girl
‚Äì ‚ÄòWell now, I‚Äôd rather have you than a dozen boys, Anne,‚Äô said Matthew patting her hand. ‚ÄòJust mind you that ‚Äì rather than a dozen boys. Well now, I guess it wasn‚Äôt a boy that took the Avery scholarship, was it? It was a girl ‚Äì my girl ‚Äì my girl that I‚Äôm proud of.‚Äô ‚Äì THESE ARE LITERALLY MATTHEW‚ÄôS LAST WORDS TO ANNE, I AM NOT OKAY
‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Reaper whose Name is Death‚Äù => As soon as I saw that chapter title I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be ready for what‚Äôs to come ‚Ä¶ this was the most painful chapter, I literally SOBBED so much, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I cried this hard during a book (‚Ä¶probably when I read a memoir about the Rwandan genocide ‚Ä¶ yeah, that‚Äôs how bad I cried)
‚Äì For the first time shy, quiet Matthew Cuthbert was a person of central importance; the white majesty of death had fallen on him and set him apart as one crowned. ‚Äì STOP STOP STOP, the tears are flowing again!!!
‚Äì Anne deciding to stay with Marilla and help her with the farm instead of going away to study at Redmond ‚Äì I AM SOBBING
‚Äì ‚ÄúWhen I left Queen‚Äôs my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought I could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I don‚Äôt know what lies around the bend, but I‚Äôm going to believe that the best does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend.‚Äù ‚Äì STOP STOP STOP 
‚Äì Gilbert giving up his teaching position for Anne, + the two of them reconciling at the end of the book ‚Äì I AM SOFT ... I am only reading the next two books for their relationship tbh, I NEED to see them together!

***

Update 1: For the first time in my life, I got myself a Netflix subscription. Yes, it was for Anne with an E. Just watched the first episode (literally sobbed the whole time). I HAVE ZERO REGRETS. Can't wait to see where this show takes me!

Update 2: It has only taken in a week to watch the entirety of all THREE SEASONS of ""Anne with an E"" (...and oh boy I HAVE SO MANY THOUGHTS, not all pleasant, especially when it comes to how trauma-ridden and separated and unresolved the storylines of the Black and indigenous characters were...) and I need more of this world. I can't believe that season 3 basically ends where book 1 ends ... with Anne wanting to go to college. GAAAAAAH. I wanted so desperately to see her in college and SEE her relationship with Gilbert ... guess I'll have to read book 2 and 3 after all. Will place my order shortly lmao."

1260,Jonathan Terrington,Les Mis√©rables,"Sep 17, 2012",5,"""We can only suppose that its new life as a musical - and what an appropriate fate for that most operatic novelist - will help to bring Les Mis√©rables to the attention of a new generation of readers, reminding them perhaps that the abuses Hugo catalogues are still alive elsewhere, awaiting their own chroniclers in the brave new world of the twenty first century."" - Peter Washington, Introduction

There are few novels which one can consider true masterpieces and among the greatest pieces of writing ever written. The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, The Complete Sherlock Holmes and Complete Stories and Poems number among these as examples. However there are some momentous epics in terms of themes such as Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and this great work: Les Mis√©rables, which despite their length are well worth the investment.

Les Mis√©rables, as a novel, is far grander than its worthy adaptations (of which the 1998 film with Liam Neeson and the stageplay are the finer works). It is not the simple tale of Jean Valjean escaping from Inspector Javert. It is so much more. It is: a love story, the love story of France as well as a romance; a tragedy, a catalogue of the miserable citizens of historic France; a historical chronicle, a mapping out of the cultural landscape of one image of time; above all it is a literary masterpiece.

Victor Hugo may have his failings in this novel. At times he falls into pompous verbosity, rambling on about subjects which appear to lack relevance to the story. However, what he has achieved in this novel is nothing short of remarkable. This is literature at its finest, a book recording the suffering and beauty of humanity and reflecting upon it in language which is both complex and simple despite translation. Speaking of translation, this version by Charles E. Wilbour appears quite excellent (if old fashioned). And therefore anyone interested in reading this work is encouraged to get a true unabridged version. Reading the abridged versions will only ruin the charm of the story and perhaps your understanding of the story itself.

1261,Meredith,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Jun 06, 2008",2,"Resounding accuracy of the voice of a boy teetering on the brink of adulthood, goodreads? Um yeah, maybe if all kids teetering on the brink of adulthood made you question if they were autistic and spent the majority of their free time reading the classics and going to therapy. Don't get me wrong. This book is good. You want to find out what the deal is with the main character for the entire book and at the end, you eventually get a pretty damn good idea. But for the love, this is not the Catcher in the Rye for the 90s. And it's just unrealistic. You find out at the end why he is so weird, but the catch-22 about this book for me is that a kid with his kind of emotional issues probably never would have been able to experience the kind of social interaction he experiences and writes about throughout the book. 

Bottom line, kids are mean, especially in HS, and they would have been mean to this kid if he was as odd as he portrays himself to be in the ""letters"" he writes. In the book, the big denouement is catalyzed when he finally makes out with a girl he's had a crush on the whole book. In real life, that girl never would have even spoken to him, let alone gotten to the point of making out with him. 

Finally, there is a whole hippie vibe to this book that reminded me of a Wonder Years episode. You'd have no idea that it was supposed to take place in the early 90s if the diary entries hadn't been dated. The lack of relevant cultural references really bothered me."
1262,Brina,Of Mice and Men,"Jan 05, 2018",4,"Over the past year, I have rediscovered John Steinbeck as a master American story teller. Having read Cannery Row and its follow up Sweet Thursday, I realized what a prolific author Steinbeck was and hope to continue my reading with a number of his novels this year. One novella I did read while in school but have a fuzzy memory of is Of Mice and Men. With a square on this year's classic bingo board being read a group read that you haven't read yet, I decided that it was as good a time as any to revisit this work of Steinbeck's through adult eyes.

Near the Salinas River and Soledad, California, two nomadic farm hands named George and Lennie stake out their existence in life. George dreams of having his own farm house and acreage but it is during the depression and he has little money saved. He also promised Aunt Clara, really a family friend, that he would take care of her nephew Lennie, a dimwitted yet strong man. Steinbeck portrays George as an average man during his era who attempts to find work in order to make ends meet, yet he has the added burden of caring for and providing for Lennie's well being. Had this been written in contemporary times, Lennie would have been characterized as developmentally disabled or autistic, yet in the 1930s society could not pinpoint what ailed people like Lennie. They were dismissed as dimwitted with little future, preventing those caring for them in having many prospects for bettering themselves either.

The reader finds out that Lennie loves animals although with his limited mental capacity he does not have success in caring for them, killing one mouse, rabbit, or puppy after another. Steinbeck alludes to the fact that the reason that George and Lennie are in between jobs is because Lennie had felt a woman's dress meaning no harm, yet the act alarmed other members of their work team, forcing the duo to flee the premises. As the pair approaches yet another farm, George makes Lennie promise to keep his mouth shut, to do whatever George asks him to, and to please stay out of trouble. Despite the best of intentions, with Lennie's condition being what it is, he does not always remember to do what George asks of him, putting both of their futures in jeopardy.

As in past jobs, George quickly becomes friendly with the rest of the work crew, attempting to distance himself from Lennie. Lennie ends up attempting a friendship with the rest of the outcasts on the farm, including a Negro horseshoe hand, yet even this relationship ends in tragedy. When Lennie's actions result in tragic proportions, George must choose between protecting Lennie and thinking of himself and his own future, with the denouement coming to a upsetting climax. I could not help but thinking that if George and Lennie lived today with society's awareness of degrees of developmental delays, that both George and Lennie would have enjoyed a happier existence. The burden of caring for Lennie would not have been placed on George, and Lennie himself would have been taught the rudimentary aspects of self care and perhaps even been placed in a basic job. Yet, placing George and Lennie in modern times is hearsay and their relationship ended in tragedy with Steinbeck placing George in a precarious situation which he would have to dwell upon for the rest of his life. 

In reading Steinbeck I have seen how he has done a masterful job in painting his characters as archetypes of the era in which they lived, usually depression era California. George and Lennie are two men looking to better themselves in a decade when one had little to be happy about. While rereading this tragic novella, I could not help but think if like other books I read for school if this is above most teenagers heads. Perhaps, teachers could discuss George and Lennie's relationship and where Lennie would be if he lived today, much as I did while reading. Yet, like other books I read at the time, Of Mice and Men gains a deeper appreciation while reading it through adult eyes. Another bingo square checked off, yet definitely not the last Steinbeck novel I will devour this year.

1263,Lisa of Troy,The Secret Garden,"Dec 27, 2022",5,"The Secret Garden has been such a delightful read during the cold, dreary winter months. Who else is looking forward to the wonder of spring, the greenery, and warmer weather?

The title ""The Secret Garden"" almost overshadows the magnificent characters. Colin always had at his disposal the grounds and fresh air, but he needed someone new to come along and offer him encouragement, someone to believe in him, someone who was willing to take him outside. 

Burnett does an incredible job with character development. We can see the characters progress and mature. We see imperfect parents and doctors. There are quite a few characters with a loud bark but no bite. 

The Yorkshire is a bit difficult to understand at times, but The Secret Garden is an enchanting read, one that I look forward to rereading.

Charming hearts since 1911, The Secret Garden is a whisper of a dream long remembered and the magic of spring and new beginnings.

Note to self: The next time that you are in New York, remember to check out The Secret Garden fountain in Central Park in the Conservatory Gardens.

‚ÄúDon't you think it's better to be extremely happy for a short while, even if you lose it, than to be just okay for your whole life?‚Äù

 
I‚Äôve read this book so many times and it never gets old. One of my favorites! I love Henry and Clare‚Äôs epic story."
1267,Meredith Holley,The Hunger Games ,"Sep 20, 2008",5,"For a long time now, I‚Äôve wanted to rewrite my review of The Hunger Games so that I could tell you why I don‚Äôt just love this series, but why I also think it‚Äôs important. It is beautiful for the unflinching way it shows you, as a reader, your own willingness to disregard people who are different from you - how you are the Capitol audience. But, it is important as a story about girls. I had not initially thought about articulating that point because it seemed so obvious to me, and I am bad at recognizing my own assumptions. Lately, though, I have seen so many people, both men and women, acting as though this remarkable book is a piece of fluff that I realized maybe what I love most about The Hunger Games is not as obvious as it seems. To me, this series is important because it is a landmark departure from the traditional story about girls.

Too often, stories objectify women. But the word ‚Äúobjectify,‚Äù I‚Äôve realized, has almost no meaning for someone who has either not experienced objectification or who hasn‚Äôt really recognized it in her own life, so I‚Äôm going to be more descriptive here. When I say stories objectify girls, I mean they talk about girls as though they are fleshlights that sometimes have handy dandy extra gadgets such as an all-purpose cleaning mechanism and food dispensing function. 

Sidebar: if you are inclined to now google the word ""fleshlight,"" I encourage you to consult the urban dictionary definition here before doing that, as the google results will probably be NSFW and also NSF those of you whose parents might check your browsing history. Do parents know how to do that? Sorry for the sidebar, I am just intending to make an explicit point, and now I am feeling uncomfortable about what that explicit point might mean to the target audience of this book. Girls, you are probably badass like Katniss, and you are definitely not a fleshlight. 

Back to my rant about typical objectification in storytelling: often the girls fleshlights have fancy outer designs  because it makes the fleshlights happy to be fancy. Sometimes they have skeeeeeery castration functions, and other times they work as helpful databases for music or video games or whatever UR into. A lot of times, I will hear people refer to this type of objectification as treating women like they are just a vagina, or a pair of boobs, but I think there is something to the stories that is less human and more sexbot machine than that complaint covers.

So, in all of those links, I have tried to include books written by men and by women because I think that women think of ourselves this way almost as often as men think of us this way. The link from The Ugly Truth, for example, shows both a man and a woman treating women like fleshlights. I have also included both books I love and books I hate because, ultimately, I do think girls adopt this story about themselves, and I also think we can pretty easily identify with a male protagonist and disregard female characters who look nothing like humans. For example, The Sun Also Rises is one of my favorite books in the whole world, even though it does not contain any women who resonate with my experience of humans. And I don't think it's necessarily bad that I can enjoy stories where women are only fleshlights, as long as I can still be whoever I want to be without a positive role model. I think it's good to enjoy stories and take what we can get from them, and so I don't regret that I love The Sun Also Rises.

In seeing some male reactions to The Hunger Games, I am reminded that most men do not identify with female protagonists the way women have been trained to identify with male protagonists. This seems like a huge disadvantage for men to be in, to me, and if you are a man reading this review, I would ask you to check out your bookshelves. How many female authors are on your shelves? How many of the books those authors wrote have no central male character? If you have a minute after that, check the shelves of a woman you are friends with and see how many of her books were written by men or have no central female character. Odds are the results will be pretty different.

The Hunger Games is such a groundbreaking and deliberate example of a woman‚Äôs perspective on war and family and even men that it floors me. I think it partly floors me because, other than Buffy, I can‚Äôt think of another example of a female character who really fights for herself in such an obvious and hopeful way. Katniss is strong and broken, and powerful in her brokenness. Collins‚Äôs image of a woman‚Äôs perspective is not, admittedly, as effortless as Moira Young‚Äôs in Blood Red Road, but its deliberateness has its own value. 

It is not an accident that the story shows Katniss‚Äôs emotional growth and that Peeta, as a more emotionally whole person, facilitates her emotional growth. It is not an accident that the story does not discuss the effect Katniss has on the erectness of Peeta‚Äôs and Gale‚Äôs penises. The first is not an accident because in reality, men do not have to be the emotional cowards that the stories I‚Äôve linked to above make them out to be. Masculinity does not have to mean emotional cowardice. The second is not an accident because the story is not from Peeta and Gale‚Äôs perspectives. Despite widespread rumors to the contrary, it is my experience that women pretty seldom think about their effect on men‚Äôs penises. Hopefully, we never think of our primary purpose in life, in the way so many stories think of it, as making penises erect. Hopefully, we never think of ourselves as gadgets that are super fun for other people.

There are so many reasons I love The Hunger Games series, and all of this is one I wouldn‚Äôt have initially even thought to say. I saw this Eleanor Roosevelt quote earlier this month, and it said, ‚ÄúIt is better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness.‚Äù I think The Hunger Games is a candle in the overall dark narrative of girls‚Äô perspective on life. Yes, it is also a poignant critique of reality TV and Western callousness about the catastrophes caused by industrialization in the developing world, but that, too, resonates with me in many ways because of its remarkably feminine voice. It absolutely makes sense to me that this book is not for everyone because of its violence, but I still think that it is objectively important because it shows a perspective that seems authentically feminine to me ‚Äì that talks like a girl, not like a sexy, fancy gadget. I‚Äôm not saying that in my opinion girls don‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt ever think about being sexy or erect penises, I‚Äôm just saying that it is my experience that we think and care about many, many more things than penises, clean houses, and food, and very, very few stories are willing to tell you about that. The Hunger Games is one that does, and it does so in way that is beautiful and important."
1268,Nataliya,The Book Thief,"Mar 15, 2011",5,"Wow. Words cannot describe how much I loved this book, what impact it had on me. But, like Liesel, words is all I have, so I will have to try.



This is a lyrical, poignant, heartbreaking, soul-shattering story disjointedly told by a nearly-omniscient, fascinated by humans narrator - Death. (***I must confess that I kept imagining Death as the small-caps speaking Grim Reaper from Pratchett's Discworld, baffled by humans and loving cats and curry. Don't judge me - I needed a glimpse of fun in the bleakness of Zusak's story.*** ) Death has plenty to keep it busy, as the story is set in Nazi Germany during World War II. """"Please believe me when I tell you that I picked up each soul that day as if it were newly born. I even kissed a few weary, poisoned cheeks. I listened to their last, gasping cries. Their vanishing words. I watched their love visions and freed them from their fear.""""And yet he becomes strangely fascinated with one particular human, the titular book thief, a young German girl Liesel Meminger, whose childhood is marked by war, who learns to read and love and treasure books, who has her small rebellions against the force of society, who learns to love and be loved. Who has to learn to lose what she loves. Because the world is baffling, because it is a cruel place, because often it tries to stomp out love and beauty.""I guess humans like to watch a little destruction. Sand castles, houses of cards, that's where they begin. Their great skills is their capacity to escalate.""The book is beautifully surreal, with the masterfully written language reflecting the alien, non-understandable, strangely fascinating nature of the narrator - Death. It is the mix of colors and strange metaphors, semi-dictionary entries and frequent strange asides, with skipping time, with complete disregard for spoilers. ""Of course, I'm being rude. I'm spoiling the ending, not only of the entire book, but of this particular piece of it. I have given you two events in advance, because I don't have much interest in building mystery. Mystery bores me. It chores me. I know what happens and so do you. ""It will note the strangest things, ruminate about the weirdest subjects, and casually in the middle of a lyrical passage, omnisciently will tell us that terrible things are about to occur. It is its job to know, after all. And this prescience does not soften the blows when they finally come; it only brings anticipatory dread and loving appreciation for things and people while they still ARE.""(view spoiler)[Years ago, when they'd raced on a muddy field, Rudy was a hastily assembled set of bones, with a jagged, rocky smile. In the trees this afternoon, he was a giver of bread and teddy bears. He was a triple Hitler Youth athletics champion. He was her best friend. And he was a month from his death (hide spoiler)].""





Love. Beauty. And books. This is what the story set against the terrible backdrop of war is about. Zusak accomplished a difficult feat - making me ache for the children of the enemy, the children and people of Nazi Germany, because even when caught in the middle of destruction, even ending up on different sides of artificial barricades people are still people, still deserving of love, still beautiful.

This book is the ode to those who kept their humanity in the middle of war, who were so human that nothing could ever change that. Rudy Steiner, the boy with the ""hair the color of lemons"", who has so much love and integrity and life (view spoiler)[that I cried myself to sleep over his fate that Death so casually and cruelly revealed to us (hide spoiler)], who was by Liesel's side since the beginning of their friendship - ""A snowball in the face is surely the perfect beginning to a lasting friendship."" - Rudy, who dreamed about the kiss from Liesel (view spoiler)[ until the end of his bright and too-short life.

""She leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Liesel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist's suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her fingers... She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on."" (hide spoiler)]""He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It‚Äôs his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry.""Hans and Rosa Hubermann, who possessed so much integrity and courage, who became real parents to Liesel, who risked everything for what they thought was right. Max Vandenburg, the Jewish fistfighter, who dreamed of battling Hitler and gave Liesel the perfect gift with everything he had.""[...] Papa, you saved me. You taught me to read. No one can play like you. I'll never drink champagne. No one can play like you.""

""Make no mistake, the woman had a heart. She had a bigger one that people would think. There was a lot in it, stored up, high in miles of hidden shelving. Remember that she was the woman with the instrument strapped to her body in the long, moon-slit night.""""And Liesel herself, lost and broken, but finding comfort and strength in family, friends, and books. Liesel, who learns more about the cold cruelty of this world than most children should ever know. Liesel, who learns to read from the Gravedigger's handbook, who rescues the book from fire, who would rather steal books than food, who is not afraid to show kindness in the face of very real threat, who finally gives Rudy that overdue kiss, who fascinates even Death itself. All of them remained human despite the circumstances, despite the pressure to do otherwise, despite anything. And I love them for that.

This is a wonderful, lyrical, surreal, excellent book that broke my heart into tiny little pieces and yet gave me hope that even in the worst of times we can find beauty. 5 stars is not enough, but this is all I can give. ""I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.""

DISCLAIMER: This is the first review that I've wrote after working four 14-hour days in a row followed by endless reading of textbooks and paperwork, all sore from endless and painful retracting in surgery, having composed this review in my head as a means to not pass out from hunger in the endless surgery. So if something in it seems incoherent - that's why."
1269,midnightfaerie,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Feb 07, 2012",3,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by CS Lewis is one of the books in his series, the Chronicles of Narnia in which Christianity is portrayed through various fantasy creatures. God, for instance is portrayed as a talking Lion. What a wonderful series! What child hasn‚Äôt climbed into a closet and explored the back cracks in hope of finding an entrance to a new and exciting world after reading this book? I used to sit in a closet with the door closed and a flashlight reading my favorite books after reading this series, in hopes that someday a door would open and take me to another realm. Of course, the white witch is my favorite character. I‚Äôm always attracted to the bad ones. The Lion, Aslan, is a wonderful character as well, but I have to admit, knowing that he was an analogy for God, changed my view of the story a bit and left me a bit disappointed. He was a bit cheesy. Or maybe typical is a better word. Which is why I almost wish I wouldn‚Äôt have known the true meaning of the books until after I read them. In any case, the stories were great, the first one being the best. (You always lose a little of the naivet√© of the children as they get older) But the movies did them justice as well. Reading them again as an adult, found me a little bored, but still enchanted overall with the series. The next movie is due out soon and I can only hope they will continue to make the movies which were incredible. I highly recommend this series and consider it a classic as well.

1271,Tharindu Dissanayake,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Aug 01, 2021",5,"""A face of grievances unspoken, burdens gone unprotested, a destiny submitted to and endured.""


This must have been the longest time I had waited to review a fiction after finishing the book. Even after a week, I still haven't fully recuperated from the emotional blow of A Thousand Splendid Suns... Painful, heartbreaking, but quite beautiful in a very sad way. Hosseini has improved upon what he did with Kite Runner, if that's even possible, in every conceivable way imaginable to give the reader another masterpiece! I loved every little thing about this book.


""Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman.""


When I finished Kite Runner before, it became clear how impactful Hosseini's story telling is: It was tragic yet beautiful in a unique way. I had thought I was prepared to pretty much anything the author could throw at me after that. But A Thousand Splendid Suns, for me, was a far more difficult read. Unlike in Kite Runner, Hosseini does not hold back when it comes to unfolding Mariam and Laila's story. Saying that reading through the abuse and other privations of the two protagonists was shocking would be a huge understatement. Everything felt too real to be consoled otherwise. In the Afterwards section, I did come across about Hosseini's work in UNHCR, and maybe it's his firsthand experience that made the portrayal this authentic. 


""It's our lot in life, Mariam. Women like us. We endure. It's all we have.""


The author continues to use his simple, and straightforward writing style which suits perfectly to the atmosphere he creates in these stories. But, even if one finds the writing style to be lacking in flavor, when the story telling is this good, most would never be bothered by anything else. And when you add Hosseini's flawless character development, it's impossible not to fall in love with this book. But where I saw the most significant improvement is in the plot, which stole the spotlight away from character department. The life story of the two protagonists -Mariam and Laila- allows the reader to peak in to a couple of lives heavily affected not only by war, but their journey amidst various domestic difficulties, providing the reader with another unique opportunity to empathize with Afghan people, and specifically from a woman's point of view this time. Instead of coming across hateful stories about Taliban and terrorism in general, it's enlightening to see the events from a perspective like this, which enables any reader to understand the bitter reality, along with the fact that countless thousands of people are experiencing worse circumstances in such countries. Even though it is fiction, I think it's commendable, and remarkable, what Hosseini does with these stories, as they help shift any reader's opinion about the people who are affected by wars in such countries.


""People, she believed now, shouldn't be allowed to have new children if they'd already given away all their love to their old ones. It wasn't fair.""


Everything else that was good about Kite Runner is still here, from pace, flow of events, and handling of emotions to the ending. Oh, that ending! I rarely admire a sad ending, but Hosseini is definitely the exception. During the middle part of the book, even though I loved everything, I didn't see myself giving a rating higher than 4-stars, but the concluding chapters broke me down and changed everything. Now I feel like there aren't enough starts to do justice.


""As she closed her eyes, it was not regret any longer but a sensation of abundant peace that washed over her.""
""One last time, Mariam did as she was told.""


It's not every day that I get to shelf two consecutive books from the same author as all-time-favorites. Honestly, I was not expecting this to be better than the first, and thought there might even be some repetitiveness. This is anything but that! If you loved Kite Runner, it is most likely that you will have an even better reading experience with this ATSS. However, be warned that the emotional impact this delivers is far more profound, leaving one with tears for quite a while. Unlike with Kite Runner, the luxury of hiding the despicable actions of villains, which left many horrific events to readers' imagination, is gone. But at the end of the day, just like with Kite Runner, it's worth every second... it's worth the heartbreak... it's worth evert tear... Another must-read-for-all from Hosseini.


""A young Mariam is sitting at the table making a doll by the glow of an oil lamp. She's humming something. Her face is smooth and youthful, her hair washed, combed back. She has all her teeth.""



""The little girl looks up. Puts down the doll. Smiles. Laila jo?"""
1272,Bionic Jean,Animal Farm ,"Jun 25, 2013",5,"George Orwell's Animal Farm is undeniably one of the best short novels ever written in the English language. It is a deceptively simple tale, which even older children could read. About an animal uprising, it is written in the style of a fable, and yet it can be read on so many levels. It is clearly both a satire and an allegory, a dystopian tale, and its author George Orwell made no secret of what regime, and which politicians, he was so mercilessly parodying. Yet as with all great novels, it speaks to us today and holds many timeless truths. It is the sort of novel where a reader will find new depths in each rereading.

The inspiration for the novel came from a real-life episode. Orwell had just left the BBC, in 1943, and was uneasy about some propaganda he could see distributed by the then ""Ministry of Information"". He says,

""I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.""

George Orwell wrote Animal Farm between November 1943 and February 1944, but the novel was not published straightaway, because of the USSR's status as an ally in the Second World War. George Orwell was a socialist writer, so the fact that he chose to do such a savage critique of the Soviet Union may come as a bit of a surprise to a present-day reader. One might have expected him to choose the far right, rather than the far left. But he personally felt that the Soviet Union (now Russia) of that time had itself become a brutal dictatorship, and that its original ideals had become perverted. 

Animal Farm was subsequently published in England in 1945, just after the war, and ironically it quickly became a great commercial success when it did finally appear, partly because the Cold War so quickly followed the Second World War. However the book was immediately banned in the USSR and other communist countries. To this day it is still banned or censored in some places; the United Arab Emirates, Cuba, North Korea - and China, until almost the beginning of the 21st century.

In his story George Orwell chronicles the rising to power of Joseph Stalin, who is depicted by the pig ""Napoleon"" in the novel. The story parallels his emergence as a natural leader, and gradually follows his rise to power as a dictator. Near the beginning of the novel, the farm animals overthrow their oppressor, the farmer ""Mr Jones"". This is a direct analogy to the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, when the Russian Tsar Nicholas II, who had abdicated in February, was executed by the Bolsheviks along with the rest of his family, in July 1918. Interestingly, Orwell said the drunken farmer Jones, who neglects his animals, was based on the real life Tsar Nicholas II. 

But their democratic coalition of animals, all with a vision of independence, comfort and freedom from constraints, is gradually broken down. There is straightaway a consolidation of power among the pigs, who do no work because they are the ""brainworkers"" with what is tacitly agreed as superior intelligence. Just as the Soviet intelligentsia did, the pigs establish themselves as the ruling class in the new ""free"" society. In Animal Farm they then immediately begin to manipulate and control the new state for their own benefit.

At the start of the novel, ""Major"" a middle white boar, has a dream, which he relates to all the animals, in a lengthy impassioned speech. It is a dream of the future, and of freedom for all creatures. It captures their imaginations, and inspires their actions from then on. Major is based on a combination of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. Just as Lenin's embalmed body was put on display for the people,(view spoiler)[ Major's skull is initially mounted as an emblem for the animals to revere, although by the end this is removed, and the animals are expected to worship Napoleon. (hide spoiler)] Major's principles provide the foundation for the code of the revolution and the philosophy of ""Animalism"".

The other main character at the start of the novel is the pig, ""Snowball"" who is based on Leon Trotsky. Just as in the Soviet Union, these two characters vie for power, with ""Napoleon"" using subterfuge and manipulation to his own ends. He arranges false confessions, show trials and executions to enforce his power, frequently changing history as the story unfolds. ""Squealer"" is a pig who works on behalf of Napoleon, employing various devious means to misrepresent and confuse the animals. He is apparently based on Molotov. Squealer speechifies, using elaborate philosophical ideas which the animals cannot really follow, often using the Socratic dialogue to get the answer he desires. And this is always used to justify the pigs' greedy and unprincipled behaviour; anything which is self-serving and goes against the original ideas of fairness. George Orwell is keen to show the corruption of ""Animalist"" ideals by those in power, not that the ideals themselves were wrongly held. In 1947, George Orwell wrote,

""For the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement ... I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages.""

For instance, Squealer works on the animals so that they accept a slogan which is almost the direct opposite of its original, ""Four legs good, two legs bad"" becomes ""Four legs good, two legs better"" overnight, as bleated by the impressionable, keen to follow, sheep. The reason for this is clear from the story. And ""Snowball"" (based on Trotsky) is (view spoiler)[thus expelled from the revolutionary state (hide spoiler)] by a malicious comrade eager to dominate, using any violent means available to achieve his ends. Nobody knows who they can trust any more.

The irony is at its highest in the depiction of corruption; the tyranny and hypocrisy of the pigs as led by Napoleon. The food rations get increasingly smaller, yet it is ""proved"" to them that they are all much better off than they were formerly under Farmer Jones. The animals' ideology of liberation and equality gradually disintegrates. The rules change secretly, slowly and silently, so nobody is sure what is really the truth any longer. History is rewritten; memories become unreliable; the brainwashing is slow and subtle. The animals can read, but there is little documentation, except for seven commandments, painted on the barn wall,

(view spoiler)[1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
3. No animal shall wear clothes.
4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.
5. No animal shall drink alcohol.
6. No animal shall kill any other animal.
7. All animals are equal. (hide spoiler)]

Yet over time, each of these is amended, to the advantage of the pigs, until in the end there are no words showing at all, and the final famously nonsensical maxim is spouted without question, 

""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.""

(view spoiler)[The rousing song ""Beasts of England"", which all the animal took as their National Anthem at the beginning of the story, is banned. The symbol depicting the horn and hoof, on their green flag, which indicated their Animalism philosophy and power, is obliterated. (This was similar in real life to the hammer and sickle on the Soviet flag.)  (hide spoiler)]The novel is a dual critique against the Stalinist regime of violence, but also against the imposed rhetoric, against the language employed, logic and ideals.

Another character indicated by George Orwell is his depiction of Adolf Hitler, as one of the farmers, ""Mr Frederick"", who wants to take over the renamed ""Animal Farm"". But there are many minor characters whom we all recognise in our own lives. Take the cat, who votes for both sides at the same time. Who has never come across a ""two-faced"" person? Or the pony ""Mollie"", the stereotypically vain and lazy original Essex girl, with her penchant for wearing ribbons in her hair and looking at herself in a mirror, regardless of any greater good which may come about by a little hard work. The story of the carthorse ""Boxer"" will break your heart. His courage, his steadfastness; with his personal motto, ""I will work harder!"" he is the archetypal salt of the earth. But he is na√Øve and gullible, and the reader fears that he will be taken advantage of to a devastating conclusion. You will cry, internally at least, but you will also laugh with this book. Here is an extract from the pompous poet pig, Minimus's, eulogy about Napoleon.

""Friend of the fatherless!
Fountain of happiness!
Lord of the swill-bucket!""

The conclusion of the book is predictable, but perhaps not in quite the simple way the reader expects. Yes, the oppressees become the oppressors, but in a fiendishly clever denouement. 

All the political manipulations of the novel are recognisable today. Wherever you live, you will not have to look very close from home to find such a regime. And also, the brilliance of this novel is that those characteristics of scheming, dishonesty, cynicism, and underhanded ways of achieving a particular end, are not confined to politics. Who has never watched a skilled manipulator diverting attention from one major problem by concentrating on a minor one? It may have been in politics - or it may have been in a committee meeting - or even, dare it be said, around your own dinner table. Large or small scale, these observations by George Orwell are, sadly, truths about the human condition and human behaviour. They are timeless, and present in any institution, cooperation, business, family - in fact any group of people. One critic has even suggested that Orwell has put himself in the novels as Benjamin, the donkey, a wise old creature who is the only one who pessimistically repeats, ""Life will go on as it has always gone on - that is, badly.""

Have you actually read Animal Farm? No? Then please do. You read it years ago? Then try reading it again. It is an outstanding novel, with the hallmarks of a true classic; it is both entertaining and profound."

Except that the arguments aren¬¥t direct racism anymore
Now it comes with much propaganda of right wing, neoconservative, and neoliberal politicians and news outlets to find ridiculous, unscientific, and sheer stupid and evil explanations of why the US is such a mess. Thereby the instances satirize themselves by trying to be politically correct, objective, and not too obviously hating, trolling, and warmongering against critical race theory, woke, and cancel culture. So the 

Accepted racism transformed into things like
Not directly lynching black people without a fake trial, but instead giving them fair trials. 
Black kids could go to each good private school if it wouldn¬¥t be unaffordable.
No more redlining, everyone who can effort to live in a gated community, in the countryside, or in a suburb is free to do so
And so many other direct and indirect racist societal, governmental, and especially economic reasons. The neoliberal agenda is making it possible to 

Change from direct hate speech to subtle, economic terror
Because that¬¥s perfectly fine, no matter how many million US citizens and billion people around the world in the Southern hemisphere have to suffer for economic growth. See, the mechanisms behind this are so complex, avoided by close to all news media except for the ones far left, eco social, aka leftist, and thereby stigmatized and unimportant in the US and more in more in the EU too.

 because that¬¥s what¬¥s really going on at the moment. They are what I love throwing into the faces of ignorant, brainwashed, hypocritical bigots. Because guess what,

The people trying to ban To kill a Mockingbird for decades are the same intolerant haters that truly believe in their emotions and faith instead of science, data, and progressive transformation

One can look wherever one wants in the US and already the obvious problems like mass incarceration

Sexism and discrimination against black women

Better do some demonstrative social work for social media or give a few dollars of the millions made thanks to exploitation. And avoid everything causing cognitive dissonances that could one let question ones¬¥behaviour and its underlying psychopathological illogicality. 
The suffering of so many people makes them very, very self righteously sad and they don¬¥t like the elephant in the room behind that feeling. So better ignore it.

But, as I tend to say in my profile and to give myself some hope after this pretty downing review:
Collective intelligence, networking, and collaborative learning/researching lead to the unleashing of each one's full potential and the most sustainable and progressive transformation of human society. Be an enlightened, mindful, questioning, scrutinizing, emancipated part of it.

1274,Lisa of Troy,A Game of Thrones ,"Apr 20, 2022",5,"A Male Soap Opera

Yeah, I know that I‚Äôm late to the party, but better late than never, right? 

The Game of Thrones is an epic tale that rotates between nine different points of view. The kingdom has enjoyed a relative peace with King Robert on the throne when he decided to name his second in command as Eddard Stark of Winterfell. However, there is plotting in the kingdom. Will The Starks be safe? And who will sit on the throne?

When I picked this book up, I was so confused, because there were three different characters, and lots of information coming my way. Then, I would just get my bearings and be switched to a new character‚Äôs point of view with an entire set of characters. 

 However, I realized that this book is exactly like a soap opera except with males as the target audience. The book will switch to different characters, and they are usually connected in some fashion to each other. There is a lot of repeating of information so if you don‚Äôt catch on the first time or forget something, there is a good likelihood that it will be repeated.

Instead of the traditional soap opera focusing on gazing into each other‚Äôs eyes and whispering sweet nothings into each other‚Äôs ears, this book replaced all of the romance with lust. There is quite a bit of steam. 

As any good soap opera, it is filled with lots of characters, and Game of Thrones has a lot of characters with interesting backstory. There is betrayal, humor, alliances, and battles.
Lev Grossman in Time Magazine proclaimed George R.R. Martin as ‚Äúthe American Tolkien.‚Äù As someone who has read quite a bit of Tolkien, I could not disagree more. Although these books are both fantasy, that is about all these books have in common. The Lord of the Rings had extremely long paragraphs and detailed descriptions of the various fantasy creatures. It focused on one character‚Äôs point of view. Although I admire Tolkien‚Äôs imagination and all the inspiration that he provided to the fantasy community, I had a very difficult time conjuring up the images that he was describing in great detail. It took me nearly five months to read The Lord of the Rings because it was such a chore and I kept falling asleep.

In contrast, I found myself looking forward to reading Game of Thrones throughout the day. It had many twists and unexpected turns. Martin skipped the lengthy descriptions and replaced them with interesting history and family relationships. Game of Thrones is multiple points of view on steroids, and it has short paragraphs that keep the action flowing. 

Did I love Game of Thrones? You bet. If you know me, I value good storytelling, and Game of Thrones had that in spades. Is Game of Thrones perfect? Nope. If I hear ‚Äúwinter is coming‚Äù one more time, I think I might be sick. It was stated a whopping 12 times. That is too much even if there are inattentive readers. Also, the ending was rather weak.

Overall, this is an extremely entertaining book, and I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.

1275,Fabian {Councillor},The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Oct 17, 2016",4,"‚ÄúYou know,"" said Arthur, ""it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.""
""Why, what did she tell you?""
""I don't know, I didn't listen.‚Äù 


Did this make you laugh already? Fine, because the rest of Douglas Adams' famous novel includes many more of those humorous elements.

I have a very difficult personal history with Sci-Fi novels; some of them I could appreciate but not enjoy; some I could appreciate but got bored with them very quickly; but The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was the first Sci-Fi novel which ever made me simultaneously appreciate, enjoy and even love the book. Love is a strong word, but if a book is filled with sentences like ‚ÄúThe ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy capacity for happiness you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first‚Äù, then I simply can't help but fall in love with it.



 ‚ÄúSo this is it,"" said Arthur, ""We are going to die.""
""Yes,"" said Ford, ""except... no! Wait a minute!"" He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. ""What's this switch?"" he cried.
""What? Where?"" cried Arthur, twisting round.
""No, I was only fooling,"" said Ford, ""we are going to die after all.‚Äù


I could go on and quote the entire book now, that's how much fun it was reading this and that's how quotable the book is. But Douglas Adams didn't only attempt (and succeed) to write this groundbreaking approach to the science fiction genre, he was also able to make you think a lot about several important questions: What is the meaning of life? Why do we live? Why do we die? What is the meaning of the Universe? Adams intentionally answers these questions in rather absurd ways, mainly because it is impossible to find ultimate answers and definitions for these topics. But those are all questions everyone has already asked themselves, and Adams isn't afraid to tackle them in a way that the reader can't help but laugh about it.



 ‚ÄúFor instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much‚Äîthe wheel, New York, wars and so on‚Äîwhilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man‚Äîfor precisely the same reasons.‚Äù


If you haven't read this book yet, perhaps because you are afraid of the Sci-Fi genre (which I was as well, until I started my adventures with Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Marvin and all the others in this book): then don't hesitate to read it. But don't be mistaken, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is (probably) not the best book you will ever find, it is (probably) not going to make you cry because of its emotional intensity, it is (probably) not going to keep you on the edge of your seat due to its ming-bogglingly suspenseful plot. Adams' book is rather an episodic account of several random adventures in the cosmic space, and for me it was mostly Adams' writing style which it was impossible to resist. He lures his readers into the story and before you even realize it, you are probably already laughing.

And don't forget to bring your towel!"

Just for reference, on the recent Sherrilyn Kenyon v Cassandra Clare.
Kenyon has filed a lawsuit against Clare, and also provides a list of alleged similarities between Clare's work to her own.

Read and decide for yourself.

update again! Saw some stills for the movie, and to be honest, despite being slightly spurious in my ""casting"" of City of Bones, I actually think my version is much better than the movie version.

I mean, look at Isabelle, and look at Clary.



Correct me if I'm wrong, but Isabelle is supposed to be way hotter than Clary.

And don't even get me started on Jace.



I mean, Jamie Campbell Bower was cute in a couple of his other films, but.... Jace was supposed to be..... I dunno... swoon-on-your-feet-panty-wetting hawwwt.

And Simon.....



I mean, he has ""friendzone"" written all over him.




12 Jan '13

I know this is now being made into a film, and I know they've all got the cast sorted out, but I imagined them very differently. So here's how they all played out in my head:

Simon - Aaron Taylor-Johnson

For some reason, I always imagined Simon as young Eisenheim. And a part of me wants to kick myself for associating the 2006 film with this book in any way.

Alec - Ezra Miller

And no, it's not because he's queer.


Isabelle - Jessica Szohr

Because I wanted to put this picture in here, 'kay?


Jace - Draco Malfoy

I mean come on. Is there even a debate on this??


Clary - Kristen Stewart

Only because her acting skills match the quality of Clary's personality.

Also known as Why Readers CAN Review An Author As Well As His/Her Book, And Why STGRB Are Full of Shit And Obviously Never Took English Lit Classes For Telling Us We're Not Allowed To.


I heard about the whole plagiarism issue long before I even heard of Cassandra Clare's books, so I tried getting into it as objective as possible, given the circumstances. All I know is that she pretty much copy-pasted whole wads of text from another FF writer, from published books, from TV dialogue - into her Draco Dormiens trilogy, without providing any credit to the original authors.

I also know that she lifted wads of text from Draco Dormiens into her published Mortal Instruments. What remains a mystery, though, is whether these bits copied into The Mortal Instruments were her own original pieces of writing, or some of them even plagiarized work?

I won't go much into the whole plagiarism thing, since if indeed any plagiarized work exists in The Mortal Instruments, that is pretty much speculation.
However, it does bring to mind questions of ethic; should a plagiarist be published? Some people strongly believe in giving second chances. I think people only deserve second chances when they admit to their errors and have truly proven their repentance. Both cases which I have not as of yet heard Cassandra Clare do.

Other questions popping into my head include shouldn't there be some sort of punishment for plagiarists?! I mean, if I did in university what Cassandra Clare did in Draco Dormiens (and, arguably, The Mortal Instruments), then I would've been kicked out on the curb and my pretty Master's degree ripped to shreds. And, similar to the whole Chris Brown debacle, instead of condemning her far below ethical work habits, we, the consumers, commend their ""artwork"", as if sending the message that whatever wrongs they have done, it doesn't matter because people still eat their shit up. There is no learning curve here; or at least, no deterrence factor.

But anyway, I tried to suppress these nagging questions while I read the book, because I wanted to know if I would truly, objectively, enjoy City of Bones. Especially after the whole ""GR Bullies"" absurdity, where an increasing number of voices proclaim that Reviews Should Be About Books And Completely Separate From The Author.

Well, ladies and gentlemen, my experience reading City of Bones will provide evidence (alongside many other ample evidence out there), that no - sometimes we, as readers, cannot keep the two things separate. Sometimes, our moral and ethic code just won't let us. Reading is, after all, a subjective experience, and all sorts of things influence our enjoyment of it, including our perception of the author. And if that affects our enjoyment of a book, then it damn well does belong in a review if we choose to put it there.

So. Anyway. Now that I'm off my soapbox. The biggest thing that stands out while I read City of Bones was 
how inconsistent the writing was
. It was so lazy and repetitive, information was handed over to us on a silver platter - there was no subtlety or any depth going on. But then there would be brief, short scenes or dialogues that actually made me laugh out. Those few and interspersed scenes surprised me, like one wet and icky autumn day, when I found a five dollar bill while raking up my neighbour's filthy garden.
Try as I might to ignore it, I was at a dilemma. Should I enjoy this? I mean, it's only five dollars. Surely they couldn't miss it. And, I mean, I'm working my arse off in this horrible weather because my mother owes them a lawnmower. And anyway, it might not even be theirs to begin with.
In the end, I took the money (come on, you would've, too!), but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I would have. And the delight I should have felt at finding money just wasn't there.

These funny bits of dialogues and scenes filled me with just as much inner turmoil as my five-dollar-note dilemma, and even though I know that maybe, perhaps, it could be that these are all Cassandra Clare's own words, I still couldn't shake off the icky suspicions out off my gut - did she ""draw inspiration"" from some other unknown source, here?
In the end, it just ravaged me with too much guilt and suspicions that what originally would have been a five-star scene was reduced down to three stars and a really, really sad face.

Also a part of the inconsistent writing, was the 
inconsistent narration
. I know 3rd person omniscient gives the narrator the power to sift through characters' thoughts and emotions as they please, but this is what made the narrative sound forced and contrived. We would normally follow Clary as the novel progresses - until it is convenient for us to see things from another character's perspective, in which case off we'll jump into another person's head.
These conveniences are just one example of what I mean when I say that 
the narrative lacked subtlety
. When we aren't directly being fed a certain character's thoughts and emotions through his/her own point of view, we are blatantly told their feelings by the character themselves. Rarely are people in real life so honest and self-aware as the characters in City of Bones.

""An asshat?"" Jace looked as if he were about to laugh.
""What you said to Simon--""
""I was trying to save him some pain. Isabelle will cut out his heart and walk all over it in high-heeled boots. That's what she does to boys like that.""

*

""(...) You want to know what it's like when your parents are good church-going folk and you happen to be born with the devil's mark?"" He pointed at his eyes, fingers splayed. ""When your father flinches at the sight of you and your mother hangs herself in the barn, driven mad by what she's done? When I was ten, my father tried to drown me in the creek. I lashed out at him with everything I had--burned him with everything I had--burned him where he stood. (...)""

*

""I didn't think you liked me all that much.""
Isabelle's brightness faded and she looked down at her silvery toes. ""I didn't think I did either,"" she admitted. ""But when I went to look for and Jace, and you were gone..."" Her voice trailed off, ""I wasn't just worried about him, I was worried about you, too. There's something so ... reassuring about you. And Jace is so much better when you're around.""

The point I'm trying to make, here, is that we get to know the characters because other characters are constantly telling us about them, instead of us making our own informed opinions of them based on their actions and words. This is why I say 
the writing was lazy and lacked depth
. And how Cassandra Clare tried to show us that her characters have background and troubles and are oh such damaged goods was more or less through self-testimonials such as the second quote up above, where Magnus Bane so conveniently gave away his entire childhood to three random teenagers. The chapter The Werewolf's Tale was another one of these self-testimonials for another partially-important character. 
This is a whole new level of telling-instead-of-showing. Where unimaginative writers just unload all these information through descriptive prose, Cassandra Clare was at least creative enough to hide it into her dialogue. But the same underlying problem is still there - we see none of this ""damaged goods"". I didn't need Sweeney Todd to tell me his past to know that he was a damaged, troubled man. His actions spoke it for me.

As for 
information being handed to us on a silver platter
 -- all you need to do is take a look at the entire ending scene with Valentine to see my point. The whole chapter was an infodump session. Rarely do I read villains who are so eager to reveal their past and provide explanations to their potential victims. The Harry Potter novels were slightly guilty of this - especially in the earlier books - but I believe a lot of other things about the books redeemed itself from this one fault.
Jace was also a bit of an infodumper, but I don't take away points for this. I mean, I get it - it's hard to get on without one character at least explaining what the blazes was going on.

Speaking of characters ... this is rather tough. Many reviewers despised Jace because he was such an asshole. Clary herself accuses Jace of being an asshole plenty of times. But I've lived a fair amount of years, and I was friendly with quite a few assholes during my own teenage years. And let me tell you one thing: Jace is no asshole. He's a guy with daddy issues, trying to act tough. And that is as deep as any of the characters get. I guess, he would be my favourite character out of the whole lot - not my favourite character as in the one I liked the most, but the character whom, in my opinion, was the most developed, without self-testimonials or other characters telling us about him.

But remember my five-dollar-note dilemma? Yeah. Jace was, without a doubt, a direct cut-and-paste of the Draco from Clare's Draco Dormiens trilogy - who, by default, is a creation of JK Rowling's. So forgive me if I ""can't separate the book from the author"" because frankly? If I enjoyed this book simply because of Jace, that doesn't say much about the rest of the book, or the quality of writing, because Jace is not even Clare's original character.

Further illustrating the inconsistencies of Clare's writing, though, was the sudden and drastic change in Jace's character during the scene with Valentine. There is no way one person, in such a short amount of time, could thoroughly convince and change Jace into such an ... obedient? passive? receptive? character. No matter who the person claimed he was, or what evidence he brings to the table. Even if Jace believed in everything Valentine told him, there is no way it would have drastically changed him in such a manner and such a short time.
Just as unlikely, was the way Jace was ready to walk the ends of the world with Valentine, build a new life with him, and in the next moment - after a few words from Clary - was ready to throw that all away once again. The double inconsistencies astound me. Clare simply does not understand human psychology or even human nature enough to make solid characters.

The other characters were forgettable, to say the least. They all sounded the same, I'm afraid. Witty, dry sort of humour. It gets tiring after a while. Also, the Magnus-and-Alec thing? Can I just say, ew? Magnus is like, what? Forty? And Alec is ... sixteen?
Even Valentine the Villain was ... not much of a villain. He didn't frighten me, or even daunt me. I kept reading how Clary was disgusted at how manipulative he was during his scenes, but reading the pages myself, reading his words, his actions? He wasn't particular conniving or ingenious - really, it was just that Jace was so ready to have a family back, he was willing to lap up every bit of contradicting information he heard.

Plot progression and twists were unsurprising. Uninspired. No, wait, they were inspired. By Star Wars and Harry Potter, to name a few. Perhaps even a bit of Buffy in there.

And this is where my final dilemma lies. To like, or not to like? That is the question.

For light fluff, it has entertainment value enough. But what little entertainment value there was, was lifted off other, better, pieces of work out there. To say that I did not enjoy City of Bones would be a lie; but the question is, did I enjoy City of Bones, or did I enjoy the bits of Harry Potter and Star Wars in City of Bones?

I'll let you decide if it's fine to like a book filled with other writers' characters, other authors' plot twists, other screenwriters' dialogue. Perhaps I'm being too uptight, but here's how I see it. New York with Potterverse and Star Wars. Take that away and what are you?"
1277,Emily May,Crime and Punishment,"Mar 09, 2011",5,"I've come to the conclusion that Russian door-stoppers might just be where it's at. ""It"" here meaning general awesomeness that combines history, philosophy and readability to make books that are both thought-provoking and enjoyable. 

Up until this point, Tolstoy had basically taught me everything I knew about nineteenth century Russian society and its people. By that, I mean that everything I knew was about the drama and scandals of the Russian aristocracy. The difference here is that Dostoyevsky took me on an educational - but also gripping - journey around the backstreets and drinking dens of St Petersburg. He showed me the nitty gritty details of life in Russia for those less fortunate - drunks, prostitutes, the poor - and he painted a very vivid portrait of this time and culture. 

Raskolnikov is a great protagonist; he really is. His head is one messed-up place and he constantly struggles with what he believes in, his conscience, and his desire to get what he wants. The reader is pulled so deep inside the dark depths of his mind that it's hard to avoid becoming completely absorbed in the story. He is at times nasty, at others funny, and at others pitiful. Dostoyevsky has created one extremely well-rounded and complex character. Crime and Punishment shows the human capacity for evil, but also for shame and remorse. And this latter is the real ""punishment"" for Raskolnikov when he is driven near to insanity by his guilt.

I don't really know how best to fully articulate my feelings for Crime and Punishment. I don't give many five star ratings and I rarely feel this strongly about what I've read. I actually had a dream about it! 

Speaking of dreams, I want to use this one example of Dostoyevsky's ability to engage the reader so thoroughly: I read one particular scene in the book that made me seriously distressed. I was furious, on the verge of tears, and like a child who wants to jump inside the TV to make everything better... and then Raskolnikov awakes to discover it was just a dream. I swear that my sigh of relief fully eclipsed his! But that's how far I was drawn into this world, how much I really cared about it. That doesn't happen often.

1278,Bill Kerwin,Romeo and Juliet,"May 12, 2007",5,"Two things struck me during this re-reading: 

1) From the first scene of the play, the sexual puns are drenched in metaphorical violence (drawing your weapon, laying knife aboard, forcing women to the wall, etc.), creating a stark contrast with the purity of Romeo and Juliet's love and language, and 

2) Mercutio, the Nurse and Old Capulet are something totally new both in Shakespeare and also in English drama, that is, characters who are not only realistic but whose language completely reflects their thought processes to the point where they take on a life of their own. Shakespeare would create many other such characters, but these three are the first."
1279,Robin Hobb,The Giving Tree,"Feb 22, 2013",4,"I added this book to my shelf years ago in the physical world. I've read it, I don't know how many times, mostly aloud to children. 

In conversations with other people, I've discovered that there is strong dislike for this book. I like this book, mostly because it does make me uncomfortable. I'd say the same thing about Shel Silverstein's The Missing Piece. 

You can read either of these books in less than 15 minutes, so I'm not going to worry too much about a spoiler. Basically, the tree is friends with a boy. The tree gives freely of itself to the boy, from being a place to play to furnishing apples, to finally sacrificing itself to be lumber. The tree never expresses any regret for being so generous. It never questions what the boy requests of it. Even when the boy is an old man, and the best the tree can offer is to be a stump for the boy to sit on, there is never any resentment. 

I very much like that Silverstein never signals to the reader how he thinks the reader should react to the story. He has the same technique in The Missing Piece. He tells the story simply and leaves it up to the reader to judge the characters. 

I like that. It's not easy, but I like it.

In a time when many children's books are telling children what to think or feel, when many books for kids have become entirely too preachy, I think a book where the adult can close it and say, ""Well, what do you think about that?"" is a very good idea. It's easy to agree that the boy is selfish. But what about the tree? And, again, the same is true of The Missing Piece. Good books that make kids (and adults) think."
1280,Emily May,The Fault in Our Stars,"Feb 04, 2013",2,"It seems silly that I have to say this, but I've seen many a negative review of this book met with backlash from John's nerdfighter fans, so I want to make one thing clear: I like John Green. You'll find plenty who worship him as a god amongst men and many who are highly critical of him, I fall into neither of these categories but I do like him and I enjoy watching his videos. I find him funny and I agree with a lot of what he stands for; I also appreciate the amount of charity work he does and the way he helps the ""nerds"" feel better about themselves and make it out of high school a little less scarred than they might have been. I like John Green. 

But I do not particularly like this book. 

There are plenty of people raving about this book on goodreads, on Kirkus, in various magazines and newspapers... so I realise I am in a tiny minority. I will also admit that I might not have felt the same if I hadn't already subjected myself to numerous ""cancer books"" but, as it is, I do not feel anything that unique or interesting has been brought to the table here. For the first half (approx), despite my lack of enthusiasm, I expected to give it three stars because I didn't consider it to be a bad book and it was well-written enough; however, as the book wore on, I began to realise that I was growing more and more bored and found myself struggling to read on. This was something I hadn't anticipated. I'd prepared myself for many different possibilities: heartbreak, a changed perspective on life and death, disdain, annoyance... but not bored indifference. Hence the lower rating.

One of the first problems I encountered was that the kids were wise beyond their years. And I don't mean intelligent, I mean wise. They came out with things that really only suit people who've been alive a few centuries - like Dumbledore or Gandalf - or at the very least people who are sat comfortably in middle age. I like that Green doesn't patronise his readers by oversimplifying things or dumbing down characters in a condescending effort to appeal to teenagers, but these characters behave in a way that is unnatural to the point where sometimes it is verging on ridiculous. It's not completely unbelievable that some kids exist who are actually like this, but they definitely don't all speak and behave in this way.

The characters are all, in one way or another, John Green. They all have his quirkiness, his sense of humour; I was picturing several John Greens sat around having a conversation while I was reading The Fault in Our Stars. In fact, reading this book was a little bit like watching one of Green's vlogs, which might have worked well if JG hadn't dampened the humour with philosophical musings. As it was, I had a book that was trying so very hard to be both funny and sad at the same time and ended up failing to deliver either one as successfully as I would have liked. The dialogue felt false and scripted because of the teens' tendency to showcase their depth and intelligence. Natural conversation between anyone of any age doesn't work like this and I couldn't shake the feeling that there should be a laughter track playing in the background.

The Fault in Our Stars, in my opinion, would have been far better if Green had stuck to humour like Andrews did in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. I believe that the exaggerated characters and their unrealistic conversations would have been fine in a straight-up humour book because that's not supposed to portray something real and deep and moving. But Green loses it by trying to be philosophical and, in the end, I think he has produced a book that is as melodramatic and message-driven as any other on this issue. And his attempt to balance humour and sadness left me somewhat devoid of emotion throughout and provided fewer laughs than I'd hoped.

Ultimately, I feel that JG sacrificed humour in order to be deep and philosophical - perhaps this book tried to be too many things, perhaps JG tried to be too clever. But Me and Earl and the Dying Girl was a much better book, in my opinion, because it did the whole serious illness + humour thing but didn't over-complicate things by being philosophical. Like I said near the beginning, perhaps I am just tired of these books and The Fault in Our Stars needs to be appreciated by someone who has not already exhausted themselves on similar efforts.

I really can't review this, the story is way to complicated to even begin to do that."
1282,Dr. Appu Sasidharan (Dasfill),To Kill a Mockingbird,"Jul 09, 2019",5,"This is one of the most widely read books in the twentieth century. As most of us might have read this novel in high school, many emotions, including nostalgia, will come to our mind when we hear about the story of Maycomb and its denizens. This novel, set during the Great Depression, discusses a lot of vital topics like racism and sexual assault.




 Atticus Finch is not just a hero for Scout, Jem, and the lawyers, but he is considered the hero of a whole generation. If you are someone who loves books, you might have already read this book. If you belong to the minority who haven't read it yet, I request you to try to include it in your reading list. This is one of the very few books about which I can confidently say that everyone should read.

1283,Lisa of Troy,The Great Gatsby,"Nov 05, 2020",5,"Fitzgerald, you have ruined me.

Fitzgerald can set a scene so perfectly, flawlessly. He paints a world of magic and introduces one of the greatest characters of all time, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is the embodiment of hope, and no one can dissuade him from his dreams. Have you ever had a dream that carried you to heights you could never have dreamed otherwise? When Gatsby is reunited with Daisy Buchanan, he fills the space to the brim with flowers, creating a living dream. How is anyone supposed to compete with that?

The Great Gatsby perfectly makes use of a narrator, Nick. Why is Gatsby so great? Because Nick tells us. If Gatsby told us, we would just think that he is a braggard, the least humble person in the world. 

This book is wildly addictive, so intricate yet perfectly woven together, a brilliant literary masterpiece. I have to keep going back to reconnect with Jay Gatsby, a na√Øve but beautiful and charming hope, perfectly imperfect, a relentless dreamer.

1284,brian,Twilight ,"Dec 02, 2009",2,"my name is bella. bella swan. here's what stephenie didn't tell you. it's super-duper-important.

on the morning after it rained, it was rainy outside and i frowned at it being so rainy all the time. i chuckled to myself, darn weather! i stared at the rain outside, which is where they usually keep the rain. there was never any rain in phoenix. i love phoenix. i hate rain. 


i tripped over a large air pocket on my bedroom floor and bashed my skull into the corner of my bookcase, which had three shelves and was faux wood veneer. after i applied cold compresses and stanched most of the bleeding, i drove to school, but they must have moved the school building across town. i chuckled to myself, darn school moving people!


after i drove around for a few hours looking for where they put the building, edward cullen pulled up alongside me in his shiny, silver volvo, which was silver and a saab, i think. his well-muscled chest was riding shotgun, wearing a blue-gray waffle knit long-sleeved t-shirt, relaxed fit jeans with contrast stitching in a lightly distressed wash, and an ivory-colored jacket made from the dyed skins of clubbed baby seals. he dressed very well, like someone who wears nice clothes.


his well-muscled chest waved to me like an old friend, but edward glowered at me from the driver's seat. his eyes were black. i think he came down with glaucoma.


even though he glared at me and gave me the finger, he smiled and told me to follow him to school. he knew where they kept it. i wonder how he found out. but just then, i nearly tripped over my gas pedal and fell through the windshield. i am so clumsy. when we got to school, edward's well-muscled chest walked me to english class. 


""try to be careful in there,"" the chest giggled while at the same time giving me a sinister sideward glance that made the blood in the veins under my skin in my body feel ice-cold.


""haha,"" i giggled, tapping the chest on its rippling pectorals. ""very funny,"" i then said running my finger around his kennedy-half-dollar sized nipples. ""i'll try to be careful,"" i joked, alarmed at the unearthly chill emitted by his taut obliques.


everyone stared at us in the hallway, which was a long interior space allowing access to various doors. the students were wearing clothes and talking and carrying books. through the windows of the classroom which looked onto the out-of-doors, i could see the rain was still raining outside. then i tripped over my clitoris and fell into a galvanized steel av cart on casters. three people were seriously injured.


i chuckled and turn bright red. how embarrassing.


at the end of the school day edward cullen came to walk me to my car. his chest was nowhere to be seen. probably at banana republic or out hunting mountain lions again. i chuckled to myself, darn chest!


""where's my car?"" i giggled after chuckling for a while.


""don't you remember that you totaled it this morning when you drove into the orphan's hospital?"" he said. he was looking at me with his eyes. he gave me his ivory jacket to keep me dry from the rain, which is usually very wet. then he looked at me again, smiling with the right half of his mouth but frowning with the left half of his mouth and oddly expressionless in the middle part of his mouth.


""you know,"" i said, falling over a parking bumper into a rack of bicycles, ""rain isn't the only thing there is that gets me wet.""


""let's just be friends,"" he hissed, arching an eyebrow, flexing his sinewy wrists, and flaring his beautiful muscular nostrils.


i realized then he might be a vampire. or really gay. or a really gay vampire. 


i should have known. he had erasure cassettes in the car."

That said, I know a lot of people don't enjoy Brown's books, believing he is too commercialized and over-exaggerated in his style. While I can understand why someone may think that, I don't agree. I love the complexity of the story, the reality and the fiction, the test of character strength, the puzzles, the different view points. It completely absorbs me... so I fall into the category of those who love him and this style of writing, even if others think his writing isn't fantastic. Doesn't mean I don't love the more classic and richly written novels where it's the imagery and the words that win out, too.

I had never heard of Dan Brown in his early years. I heard about the movie being made of the book and how it was coming out relatively soon. I looked it up and saw it had the ""treasure-hunter"" thrill appeal and decided to read the book before the movie could come out and warp my interpretation. So glad I did!

It's addicting. Growing up Catholic, I knew most of the religious detail, but once it weaved it art, literature, history and philosophy, I was just enamored with the story. Could it really be true? Maybe I'm related to Adam and Eve too! Ok, let's not get too crazy...

Magnificent story-telling. Quick adventure. Beautiful scenes and images. Brown exhibit's intensely good control weaving back and forth between each of the plots, sub-plots and mini-plots. It's as realistic of a treasure hunt as one can get if you are not an adventurer, archaeologist or exhibition-junkie.

But what took it to the next level for me was the amount of detail included for every component. It's the intricate of the intricate, relying on pure puzzles to move the story forward. Each new puzzle creates its own spark of drama directing readers to challenge what they do and do not know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, languages, culture, locations, etc.

It hits so many different waves of appeal that I felt it was at the top of its game. And it probably only edged out Angels & Demons because of how tight this story was. Definitely a must-read for the genre, for Brown and before watching the movie adaption."
1287,Bonnie,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass,"May 15, 2009",5,"Read both as a child, and again as an adult. Loved and appreciated it then; love and appreciate it now. 

A book everyone should read at least once, and one that I hope children are still reading today."
1288,Dianne,J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Oct 26, 2011",5,"It's been many years since I read this for the first time and what struck me is that I had completely forgotten it was written for children. Tolkien addresses the young reader directly several times, reminding them of something he's told them in an earlier chapter and that sort of thing. He never forgets the child reading the book. There are trolls and massive spiders and other scary creatures but they aren't dwelt upon and they are always quickly defeated. It's very much a child's story in which bad things happen but good wins in the end. The films are a different thing completely. 

I love the Peter Jackson Hobbit movies, though even I think it was a stretch making three of them out of one little book. In true movie fashion, the scary parts are scarier, the spiders bigger and uglier and the trolls more disgusting. The battle of the five armies took about 20 minutes to read in the book and three hours to watch on screen. The movies exaggerate everything, (what else would one expect?) bringing in characters that Tolkien didn't put in the story and even adding a romance. It seems every film must have a romance. 

Fili and Kili are made more of in the movies than the book, and along with their uncle Thorin are turned into handsome Hollywood swashbucklers, which Tolkien probably never intended. (That's not a complaint - I appreciated Thorin Oakenshield's majestic swagger as much as anyone.) The book overall has a light touch appropriate for children that the movies discarded completely. There is lots of comic relief in the films, but they are weighty stories dealt with in a much more serious tone than that taken by the book. I have read that Tolkien's family dislikes the movies because they stray too far from the intent of the books. I can understand their point of view, but whether it's even true or not, who knows?

All I can say is I love the book for certain reasons and I love the movies for other reasons. I can't choose which I like better because I really don't see them as things that can be compared. They are different stories in many ways, different characters and types of characters, different tones and different target audiences. Both are wonderful and I love them all."
1289,Judy,Gone with the Wind,"Jun 05, 2008",2,"Having a hard time slogging through the blatant racism in this book. Times sure have changed. And thank God for that.

Okay, nearly forty years since I first read it, the epic love story set against the brutality of the Civil War still manages to sweep me up. 

But the racism still wrankles, especially the glorification of the Ku Klux Klan--southern gentlemen had no other choice. They weren't bullies terrorizing people because of the color of their skin, they were protecting their women from the rapacious appetites of the newly freed slaves.

Mitchell says more than once that the blacks were like children and couldn't manage without whites taking care of them. There's a part in the book where she describes how Scarlett's mother Ellen would evaluate the Negro children, selecting the best and the brightest to be house servants. The others would be taught a trade and if they failed at that, they become field hands. As the best and the brightest of the race, the house servants were the ones who stayed with their masters, apparently aware of their own limitations.

And yet, this is a book about a strong woman who actively defies the strictures for women of her time. Scarlett runs Tara, she becomes successful at business, she bosses grown men around, even though she was taught that a lady must hide her intelligence and always appear subservient and helpless around men. Since they had little if any rights, that was the only recourse for women at the time.

I find it ironic that Ms. Mitchell never realized that just as the women were playing the role of fragile creatures subservient to the fathers and husbands, their black slaves were doing the same thing--hiding their abilities and intelligence because they had no other choice.

Something else, my daughter is reading GWTW and commented ""Everybody dies."" I explained that during the Civil War, 800,000 men died and just like the Tarletons, families lost all their sons. A good reason not to go to war."
1290,RandomAnthony,A Wrinkle in Time ,"May 27, 2010",4,"So 41 of my goodreads friends have read A Wrinkle in Time, but I never picked up the book until these past few weeks. I‚Äôm not sure how this novel and I slipped past each other in my youth. I‚Äôm guessing that since the main character was a girl I wasn‚Äôt that interested in middle school and when I grew older the science fiction elements didn‚Äôt appear strong enough to snag my interest. Oh well. Last weekend I bought A Wrinkle in Time at a Borders near the Seattle airport. I wanted the novel to get me through the grueling twelve hour journey (whoo, flight delays and pre-dawn connecting flights!) home, and I thank Ms. L‚ÄôEngle for the perfect story for early hour near-hallucinatory reading in the middle of the Minneapolis International promenade.

What makes this book so good? First off, A Wrinkle in Time works under the assumption that kids are smart enough either to grasp the nuances of some fairly deep physics or, if they don‚Äôt get every detail, they‚Äôll flow with the storyline anyway. One woman I know said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt understand all the science when I was a kid but I still loved it.‚Äù That makes sense to me. Hell, I didn‚Äôt understand all the science now, and I‚Äôm (supposedly) a grown-up. L‚ÄôEngle doesn‚Äôt just say, ‚ÄúAnd then they traveled time.‚Äù She tries to explain how time travel might work.  I wonder if so many kids, especially girls, liked this novel because they felt L‚ÄôEngle respected them as intelligent readers.

Second, A Wrinkle in Time frames Meg‚Äôs personality as multi-faceted and more complex than just about any I‚Äôve encountered in YA literature. In fact, reading this novel I couldn‚Äôt help but consider her a template on which some more modern coming-of-age characters (think Harry Potter) were modeled. She‚Äôs brave but doubts her own strength in an tangible, authentic manner. And her relationship with Calvin is sweet without getting all High School Musical. 

Third, the evil in this novel is damn scary and the darkness pure and substantial. We‚Äôre talking elemental, unadulterated evil that manifests itself in the fear and conformity of those who break down in its presence. And the characters‚Äô encounters with this evil feel real. The climatic scenes are perhaps slightly too swift but the nuances of the battle fit well with a remarkably philosophical (and Christian, but in a positive way) resolution of good and evil‚Äôs conflict. 

If my friends‚Äô reviews are any indication a lot of smart girls who turned into strong, intelligent women grew up under the spell of A Wrinkle in Time. I feel like I know them a little better after reading this novel, and I can see them all, around age ten, turning the book‚Äôs pages in their rooms, feeling their own strength and potential. And that‚Äôs damn cool, really, don‚Äôt you think, a whole generation of girls reading A Wrinkle in Time? Maybe little girls across America are googling ‚Äútesseract‚Äù as we speak‚Ä¶"
1291,Jibran,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Dec 30, 2014",5,"For a long time I could not find words to write anything on One Hundred Years of Solitude, for Marquez mesmerised me into a silence I didn't know how to break. But I have been commenting here and there on Goodreads and now it is good time, finally, to gather my thoughts in one piece. But this somewhat longer review is more a labour of love than a coherent attempt to review his opus.

Marquez resets the history of universe such that the old reality ceases to exist and a new parallel world is born in which things do not conform to obsolete, worn-out laws. Everything in this world is to be discovered anew, even the most primary building block of life: water. Macondo is the first human settlement of Time Immemorial set up by the founding fathers of the Buendia family. It is a place where white and polished stones are like ‚Äòprehistoric eggs‚Äô; an infant world, clean and pure, where ‚Äòmany things lack names.‚Äô And it is natural that here, in the farther reaches of marshland prone to cataclysmic events, the mythscape of One Hundred Years of Solitude should come into existence. 

The tone of this epic and picaresque story is set ab initio. Take a gander at this:

Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.

It is not long before fateful human activity mars the innocent beauty of creation. The more they discover the more they are sucked into the inescapable cycle of life. The primordial myth that moulds and shapes their destinies does not let them advance in their efforts to defeat the infernal solitude of existence, whatever they might do, however they might try. History gets back at them again and again and every generation is but a repeat of the past. It is to emphasise the cyclical nature of time, in my opinion, that names of principal characters are repeated in every generation, sometimes to the confusion of the reader, easily rectified by going back to the family tree provided in the start of the book. 

An external, portentous, disastrous, evil-like power guides and transforms the lives of people in the hamlet of Macondo. The sense of foreboding pervades the whole story: the rain continuing for many days and inundating the streets, the unceasing storm before the arrival in town of a heraldic character, and the fearful episode when townspeople begin to suffer a terrible memory loss, so that to remember the names and functions of things they write it down on labels and tie those labels to objects like chairs and tables. It tells us that we cannot hope for a future if our past is erased from the slates of our collective consciousness. Past may be a burden but it is also a great guiding force without which there's no future. 

The only way to retain your sanity is to remember your history and cling to it, or prepare to go insane. When one Jose Arcadio Buendia loses the memory of things, he goes mad:

Jose Arcadio Buendia conversed with Prudencio Aguilar until the dawn. A few hours later, worn out by the vigil, he went into Aureliano‚Äôs workshop and asked him: ‚ÄúWhat day is today?‚Äù Aureliano told him that it was Tuesday. ‚ÄúI was thinking the same thing,‚Äù Jose Arcadio Buendia said, ‚Äúbut suddenly I realized that it‚Äôs still Monday, like yesterday. Look at the sky, look at the walls, look at the begonias. Today is Monday too.‚Äù On the next day, Wednesday, Jose Arcadio Buendia went back to the workshop. ‚ÄúThis is a disaster,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLook at the air, listen to the buzzing of the sun, the same as yesterday and the day before. Today is Monday too.‚Äù That night Pietro Crespi found him on the porch, weeping for‚Ä¶his mother and father. On Thursday he appeared in the workshop again with the painful look of plowed ground. ‚ÄúThe time machine has broken,‚Äù he almost sobbed,‚Ä¶he spent six months examining things, trying to find a difference from their appearance on the previous day in the hope of discovering in them some change that would reveal the passage of time.

The town is threatened when the change taking place in the outside world begins to spill over into Macondo. Here we have a metaphor for the struggle of Maruqez‚Äôs native country and continent which is passing through internecine wars on its way toward externally imposed modernity. Divisions that hitherto did not exist come to define the inhabitants of Macondo and of towns farther afield. One of the Buendias, Colonel Aureliano, takes up a piece of metalwork as new and strange as a gun to mount a revolt and bring the promised glory to his land. New lines are drawn. New alliances are made. Old friends become enemies and enemies, partners. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, when he is about to kill him, tells General Moncada:

Remember, old friend, I'm not shooting you. It's the revolution that's shooting you.

The scene above captures the mechanistic element of their revolutionary war; the one below bares the meaninglessness of the conflict, so pertinent to the 20th century militarisation of the whole continent and its endless armed strife led by colonels and generals of all hues and shades. 

Tell me something, old friend: why are you fighting?""
What other reason could there be?"" Colonel Gerineldo Marquez answered. ""For the great Liberal party.""
You're lucky because you know why,"" he answered. ""As far as I'm concerned, I've come to realize only just now that I'm fighting because of pride.""
That's bad,"" Colonel Gerineldo Marquez said.
Colonel Aureliano Buendia was amused at his alarm. ""Naturally,"" he said. ""But in any case, it's better than not knowing why you're fighting."" He looked him in the eyes and added with a smile:
Or fighting, like you, for something that doesn't have any meaning for anyone.‚Äù

Although I tried to avoid getting into this discussion, but a review of this work is not possible without throwing in the inevitable buzzword ‚Äì magical realism. Although the book gets high praise from most readers, it is to be expected that some readers would take a disliking to the basic ingredients from which Marquez draws his style and narrative devices. I want to address in particular one argument from the naysayer camp that pops up again and again: it is not realistic; it can‚Äôt happen; this is not how things work. So I ask (and try to answer): what is it with our obsession with ‚Äúrealism‚Äù that makes some of us reject the conceptual framework of this novel?

Aristotle in Poetics argues that a convincing impossibility in mimesis is always preferable to an unconvincing possibility. The stress is not on what can physically happen but on mimetic persuasion. This is why some novels that follow every bit of convention, every bit of realistic element in them turn out to be unbelievable stories with unbelievable characters. You want to forget them as soon as you finish the book ‚Äì and toss it aside. But on the other hand Greek tragedies populated with cosmic characters pulling suprahuman feats continue to enthrall generations of readers. How realistic are those stories? It is the writer‚Äôs task to convince us that this could have happened in a world he has created and set the rules for. In that Marquez is more than successful, and this is the basis of the enduring appeal of this work. 

The distinction fell into place for me when I replaced ‚Äòrealism‚Äô with ‚Äòtruth.‚Äô Kafka‚Äôs haunting stories are so far from the 19th century convention of realism we have come to accept as the basis of novel-writing. His The Metamorphosis is not a representation of likely human activity (how could a human transform overnight into a large insect?) but it is nonetheless a harrowingly truthful story that advances existential dilemmas and makes a statement on human relationships, familial in particular. We say this is how it would feel like to be an outcast from one‚Äôs family. Or consider Hamsun‚Äôs Hunger in which a starving man puts his finger in his mouth and starts eating himself. In the ‚Äòreal‚Äô world Kafka‚Äôs, Hamsun‚Äôs and Marquez‚Äôs characters cannot exist but the effect of their existence on us is as truthful and real as the dilemmas of any great realistic character ever created.

Marquez, like a god, has written the First Testament of Latin America, synthesising myth and magic to reveal the truth of the human condition, and called it One Hundred Years of Solitude.

1292,Elle,Divergent ,"Jun 14, 2011",4,"There comes a time in every average, misunderstood, flat chested, never-been-kissed, pre-war heroin, sixteen year old girl's life when she must decide between right and wrong.

Yes. RIGHT and WRONG.

Not Harry and Sam. Or Harry and Mike. Or, frak help us, Harry, Sam AND Mike. No no. In Divergent, Good, Evil and Tris are our love triangle. How utterly refreshing.

Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong. You will find your standard amount of PG-rated teen romance in this book. Check it:


Oh, eh... Wrong book. My bad.

But romance isn't the focus. And that makes me super-dooper shiney-whiney happy with sprinkles on top because I find my focus is easily persuaded elsewhere if there isn't enough action happeni....


... huh? Oh, right, right. The Plot. 

Imagine: The population of Chicago has been divided into factions based on five standard values: bravery, intelligence, honesty, kindness and selflessness. Once you have chosen which of these virtues is most awesome of all you are placed into a community of like-minded individuals who will then become your only friends, peers, colleagues and the pool from which you will select your husband/wife. And best of all, you will never have anything do with anyone from the other evil, evil factions if you can help it. You see, this way you are safe in your tight little community cocoon and can spend your days bitching about how fucked-up those other factions are for choosing what is clearly a far less awesome way of living.

And you certainly never have to worry that your batshit-crazy intelligence-loving neighbours are keeping busy by plotting your evil demise. No no. The city carries on in a complete state of peace, love and mung beans.

o_O

Bitch please.

Now, what I would like to know is, which facking genius came up with THAT idea? Who was it that got up and said, ""Hold up peeps. I've totally got it. We'll DIVIDE the city by forcing everyone to choose ONE AND ONLY ONE principle virtue and we'll even make it obvious by getting them to wear different colours so that there will be no question whatsoever as to which group they belong. SEPARATION is the way forward.""

Wait. WAIT WAAAAIT!

 

What?

I'm not ENTIRELY convinced that the dystopian element makes all that much sense. Much in the same way that Delirium was all 'Love is the vicious cause of all our problems'. But that doesn't really bother me all that much. Me? I'm still cheering over the fact that we don't have to sit through another love triangle. Yeeeeehaaaawww!

And that's not even the best news! Nuh uh. That's not EVEN what I came here to say! The absolute BEST thing about Divergent is that Tris rates a high BADASS on the awesome-o-meter. Seriously. She's a moody, self indulgent, gun firing, cliff jumping, ass kicking little bitch-faced mole. AND I JUST LAP THAT SHIT UP, YO!"

1296,Jake,Wuthering Heights,"Feb 26, 2007",5,"I first read this in AP English Literature - senior year of high school. This book is dense and thick and confusing, and with a class full of haters, it was hard to wrap my head around it. I subsequently read it three or four more times for classes in college and every time I read it, I loved it more. I always found some new, fascinating piece of the story I had never picked up on.

The last time I read it, I suddenly realized that there were many hints and clues that Heathcliff could, in fact, be black. A quick shot at research into Liverpool, where Mr. Earnshaw found the urchin, shows that it was the home to a thriving slave trade. This theory completely changes the story, in my opinion.

Or the thought someone brought up in our seminar on the Brontes - what if Nellie is in love with Heathcliff and subsequently altered how she told the story? You do find Nellie to be coincidently involved in many key scenes throughout the text. What if she isn't the good guy most readers assume she is?

Wuthering Heights is one of the quintessential novels in history. There's nothing else you can really say about it, except that it's one of the best pieces of writing to ever be created. It's just that incredible.

The selfish, uncaring boy who takes and takes and takes from the tree until the tree literally has nothing more to give, just makes me want to reach through the pages and throttle him. What's the message here? Is it ""When someone loves you, it's okay to just take advantage of them endlessly because they will always be there for you anyway""? Or perhaps ""If you love someone, just give them everything you have and expect nothing in return, ever.""

1300,emma,The Help,"Nov 04, 2021",1,"how do you even discuss the damage this book, completely well-intentioned as it seems to be, has done?

i guess i can start this way:
the year i turned 12, this book was The Book. sold bajillions of copies, topped best-of lists by critics and media and readers, sold its movie rights. because i was a 10 year old who read everything, and because this book sounded hard but important, i got it for christmas.

i read it for the first time that day and cried my eyes out at the ending. i read it a million times more after that, not putting it down for what would ultimately be the last time until i was well into teenagedom. i didn't always answer the question ""what's your favorite book?"" with this, but i sometimes did.

in other words, because i had just turned 12 and because i lived in a mostly white area and and because my library selection was well-meaning but white and because i went to a public school where we didn't learn about slavery or jim crow or reconstruction until middle school, and we didn't REALLY learn about it ever, this book, by a white woman, was one of my first encounters with the concept of race.

this book, which is about a white woman being better equipped than black women to tell their story twice over, both on-page and off.

this book, which serves as an instruction manual for white women on how to use their tears. (an unnecessary one, since we've always been fairly good at that, but one all the same.)

this book, of white saviordom and of black women as background and as supporting characters to white protagonists and as both nannies and mothers but only one role matters to the story. 

this book, in which black women speak in dialect and white women (even the ""white trash"" ones) speak in unaccented grammatically perfect english. 

this book, which begins and ends in the 1960s and yet is feel-good above all, attempting a ""we're all people!"" happy tone that ignores privilege and racism and what is to come in order to try on the kind of color-blind belief system that eases the existences of white people everywhere. 

this book, an account of black women losing their jobs and livelihoods and white women becoming what they always dreamed of being. 

how to begin to undo the impact this story had on my brain?

this is part of a series i'm doing in which i review books i read a long time ago and reveal my addiction to getting yelled at in comments"
1301,Elle (ellexamines),The Princess Bride,"Oct 31, 2019",3,"I hate saying this but the movie is legitimately better. This book at times felt like an odd first draft of my favorite movie to me‚Äîquotes that I loved in the movie are somehow delivered in a manner that is rather oddly unfunny. I think this might be a case of the movie ruining it a bit for me... but also, I doubt I would've ever loved the movie as much if I had read this first. 

I read this from someone who‚Äôs read the book before: do not read the 20th-anniversary introduction. As someone who read it unwittingly I can confirm it‚Äôs fifty pages long and not good. Also, and I wish I had something better to say about this--the framing device is so obsessed with the fact that his son is fat and it gets really distasteful. It‚Äôs not even funny in the first place. I feel the same way about the Buttercup's Baby outro, which just felt like it ruined my childhood a bit (it kills off a character? I think temporarily? But it still kills off a character? It's also just still not funny?)

I genuinely think without the intro and outro making me feel like I wanted to kill William Goldman I probably would've liked this a lot more. As it was, they just made me feel a weird sort of animosity towards the author, not for ruining his book but for thinking he's funny enough for me to read a 50-page backstory about him finding this book and reading to his son (who is fat, I don't know if you heard. did you know that?).

Here are some things I did enjoy about this book:
‚ÜíThe timeless feeling to the story
‚ÜíThe feeling of the story within a story, the edited version of an obsessed-with-beauty fairy tale, is fun
‚ÜíInigo Montoya you killed my father prepare to die is still iconic
‚ÜíFezzik‚Äôs backstory!! I liked that a lot!!
‚ÜíWestley is way more useless at the beginning of this book and I thought that was funny
‚ÜíHumperdink is a little different from the movie but equally amusing
‚ÜíButtercup has some character development! Not a lot but some fun stuff!
‚ÜíI love you so much more now than twenty minutes ago that there cannot be comparison. I love you so much more now than when you opened your hovel door, there cannot be comparison. There is no room in my body for anything but you. My arms love you, my ears adore you, my knees shake with blind affection. My mind begs you to ask it something so it can obey.

I have mixed feelings on this and I really wish I hadn't read the intro now.

1303,Mischenko,The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure,"Aug 05, 2021",4,"Summary: The book opens with author William Goldman explaining how his father would read to him as a young child. One story he would read was titled The Princess Bride by S. Morgenstern, a man from Florin. Goldman loved the story so much as a child, so he decides to give a copy to his ten-year-old son on his tenth birthday. Jason, his son, can‚Äôt seem to get into the story at all, and Goldman soon realizes that this isn‚Äôt the same story his father told him. This book has incredibly uninteresting parts that Goldman doesn‚Äôt recall. So, he begins to retell the story by creating a whole new book with only the good stuff.

Now we begin to read The Princess Bride‚Äî a story about a girl named Buttercup, one of the most beautiful women in the world. Buttercup loves demanding the farm boy, Westley, to complete tasks. At one point, she realizes she might even love him. Soon the two admit their love for each other, and Westley sets off to seek his fortune so they can begin their life. Buttercup‚Äôs heart drops not long after when she hears that Westley was killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts‚Äìa pirate who murders all. Buttercup vows that she will never love again, but she agrees to marry a prince for convenience. Was this a wise choice to make? Is Westley dead after all? There‚Äôs no telling what adventure awaits for Buttercup and the other characters in this story.

Story: I‚Äôve always loved fairy tales, and this story is a good one. The Princess Bride wasn‚Äôt as fairytale-like this time around like it was the first time I read it as a younger reader. It‚Äôs very similar to the movie but much more descriptive. It‚Äôs exciting, comical at times, and full of action. This time around, I wasn‚Äôt feeling the ‚Äòtrue love‚Äô between Buttercup and Westley, and I also forgot how adventurous and comical it is. The film seems to do a much better job on the love story than the book‚Äìamong other things. The cliffhanger ending had my jaw on the floor‚Äîno joke. I‚Äôm still not sure how to feel about it because there are multiple possibilities of what could‚Äôve happened, and it niggles me. It‚Äôs interesting how what you expect to happen in the story isn‚Äôt what happens at all. This is a fantasy, and you must suspend disbelief at times. But there are also constant reminders that life isn‚Äôt perfect, and things aren‚Äôt always going to be okay.

Characters: The characters are lacking. We don‚Äôt learn that much about Buttercup other than the fact that she isn‚Äôt perfect. She may be beautiful, but she has some self-consciousness and jealousy, which is very different from the brave character portrayed in the movie. Book Buttercup is different and not as likable, in my opinion; she even annoyed me at times. Westley‚Äôs a bit more aggressive in the book, and he even strikes Buttercup, which was a mere raise of the hand in the film. Maybe it was meant to be funny? Other characters were more richly drawn, including Fezzik, Inigo, and Prince Humperdinck. Fezzik turned out to be my favorite character after all, and if you want to learn more about this gentle giant, you won‚Äôt want to miss out on reading this book. The illustrations turned out to be few and far between, but it was still neat to visualize the characters.

Writing: The writing is smooth and easy to read, but the format takes some getting used to. You could technically skip the author‚Äôs commentary altogether and just read the story of Buttercup and Westley. I took the time to read the author‚Äôs thoughts when it was interesting. Some people may love the going back and forth, but the commentary‚Äîalbeit infrequent‚Äîcan be distracting. 

Should you read it? It‚Äôs hard to say. The Princess Bride was a reread for me, and I forgot some of the content. I had a love/hate relationship with the commentary by the author. It essentially is a fictional story about a fictional story, and the author puts his two cents in by talking about what he took out (when he wrote it) and why. Goldman shares opinions on what‚Äôs happening in the story written by S. Morgenstern (who‚Äôs fictional as well, by the way). He also shares stories about his family, although that may be fictional too. I found myself skimming over the first half of his excerpts, but then parts of the second half felt necessary, especially in the end. Even though the movie does follow the book fairly closely with plot and characters, the film has more of a fairy tale feel to it, and cannot be compared. With that said, the book has more on the characters and more depth that the movie doesn‚Äôt, including detailed histories for Fezzik and Inigo and a continuation of the story into Buttercup‚Äôs and Westley‚Äôs future together. So, therefore, I say true fans of the film should probably read the book!

I just can't get over this book. It is absolutely  stunning. 

This is a book I will continuously re-read throughout my life, and is especially great to read when you are becoming too consumed in the adult world. I'm in my exam period currently, so reading this now was perfect. 

I also listened to the audio book for this re-read, and the narrator was perfect for this story (and he is Australian!)"
1305,Richard Derus,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Nov 20, 2011",4,"Okay, the film's an *April 2018* release but principal photography is over at least.


2018 UPDATE What is wrong with people? I do not comprehend the downer delivered by everyone and her little dog on this film. Can't be misogyny, the character was always a girl; so that leaves...mm hmm...racism. A black woman behind the camera, a lovely and talented young one as Meg. Must have fits and fall in 'em! ""It's not like the book!"" Umm...it's a movie...and guess what? It's a lot closer than y'all let on. It's a decent film and it wouldn't have been *possible* to get this close in a live-action film until this century. I've now watched it twice and from my very informed perspective as a reader and a filmgoer, lots and lots of information and criticism absorbed and debated, this is a fine film and more faithful to the book than anyone had any reason to expect.

Rating: 4* of five

The Publisher Says: It was a dark and stormy night; Meg Murry, her small brother Charles Wallace, and her mother had come down to the kitchen for a midnight snack when they were upset by the arrival of a most disturbing stranger. 

""Wild nights are my glory,"" the unearthly stranger told them. ""I just got caught in a downdraft and blown off course. Let me be on my way. Speaking of way, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract.""

Meg's father had been experimenting with this fifth dimension of time travel when he mysteriously disappeared. Now the time has come for Meg, her friend Calvin, and Charles Wallace to rescue him. But can they outwit the forces of evil they will encounter on their heart-stopping journey through space?

My Review: Meg Murry's daddy left home unexpectedly and without saying goodbye. The adored parent left behind an adolescent daughter, three sons, and a beautiful and smart wife. Meg cannot make herself get used to his absence and can't even pretend that she's not hurt by the town's opinion that he ran off leaving her mother. This, plus braces, wildly curly hair, an intelligence far greater than her contemporaries', and glasses, isolate the girl with her even weirder little brother Charles Wallace against their normal brothers and the rest of the world.

In time-honored tradition, these misfits are actually being prepared to fight the ultimate battle of Good Versus Evil, no pressure on the children no no no, and save their Daddy, not like it's gettin' piled even higher oh no! One fine day, Meg and Charles Wallace are called to their destiny by Mrs Which, Mrs Who, and Mrs Whatsit, the eccentric old ladies who prove to be avatars of interdimensional good beings with the agenda of making the Universe safe for goodness and happiness again.

The children are joined by fellow misfit Calvin, a popular boy athlete in their town whose hidden depths have tormented him all his life, in the quest to make the evil entity, a disembodied brain called ""IT,"" that slowly takes over planets and compels all life thereon to submit to being in a group mind, erasing individuality and leaching away happiness.

This is a YA novel, so all turns out well, with Mr. Murry coming home and the children being brought home all safe and sound. But how they get home is very interesting: They travel via tesseract, a geometric figure that extends into a fifth dimension beyond spacetime. Mr. and Mrs. Murry have been researching this in their roles as scientists, and Mr. Murry has used the tesseract to get to the planet from which he's rescued. The Mrs Who/Which/Whatsit interdimensional beings use the tesseract to ""tesser"" or wrinkle the fabric of spacetime to get the children there as well.

Fascinating stuff for a Christian housewife to be writing about in 1960-1961! And make no mistake, the book is a very Christianity-infested Message about the perils of brains without hearts leading to Communistic group-think. Mrs. Murry, a capable scientist, stays home with the kiddos and makes dinner over Bunsen burners so she can keep working while she stays home to be a wife and mom. Ew.

And Meg, poor lamb, worries that she's not pretty enough because she needs braces and glasses and she's not all gorgeous like her mom is. Then Calvin, a popular boy and an athlete, shows hidden depths and falls for little Meg. So bells ring, doves coo, and hands are held, so all is well. Ew.

But it ain't Twilight, so I'm good with it. In fact, because I first read it before I was ten, I'm good with all of it. The stiff, unrealistic dialogue, the socially regressive and reprehensible messages, the religiosity...all get a benign half-smile and an indulgent wink.

Because sometimes you just need to know that 
someone
 out there believes that good CAN triumph over evil."

im going to a 1920s themed party tonight and so, naturally (being the bookworm that i am), im gonna do a quick re-read to give me all those gatsby-esque vibes! all the glitzy glamour, flashy fashion, and daring dreams will definitely get me in the mood! 

i first read this in 10th grade english class and it will always be a very dear book to me. it was the first classic i read that i felt like i understood. and not only that, it was the first classic that i actually enjoyed, leading me into my love affair with the words of fitzgerald. 

i loved (and still do) experiencing the extravagant and luxurious lifestyles, the idea of morality in the 1920s, the scandalous nature of love and betrayal, and how beauty can become corrupted. 

such a compelling and tragically wonderful story that will forever remain one of my faves.

1309,J.G. Keely,Fahrenheit 451,"Oct 25, 2007",3,"Farenheit 451 has been analyzed and reinterpreted by every successive generation to change its meaning. This is chiefly because the book is full of assumptions and vague symbolism which can be taken many ways, and rarely does anyone come away from the book with the conclusion the author intended, which would suggest that it is a failed attempt.

There are grounds to contend that even the title is inaccurate, since contemporary sources suggest paper combusts at 450 degrees Celsius, which in Farenheit would be more than 800 degrees. The truth is, paper combustion is gradual and dependent on many factors; even if some paper might combust at 451F, his title is at best an oversimplification, but Bradbury was more interested in a punchy message than in constructing a thoughtful and well-supported argument.

It's not a book about book censorship, but a book about how TV will rot your brain. Bradbury himself has stated this again and again, as evidenced in this article which quotes Bradbury and in videos from Bradbury's own website--indeed, in an interview, he stated he was inspired to write it because he was horrified that a woman might listen to a radio while walking her dog. Not only does he patronizingly assume that she's listening to a soap opera, instead of news, or appreciating classical music, but it's a strangely anti-technology pose for a sci fi writer to take--does it really matter whether we get our art and knowledge from compressed tree pulp, or from radio transmissions?

This book falls somewhat short of its satirical mark based on this cranky lawn-loving neighbor's message. Then again, it was written in the course of a few days in one long, uninterrupted slurry (mercifully edited by his publishers, but now available utterly restored). It contains archetypes, misconceptions, and an author surrogate, but can still be seen as a slighting view of authority and power, and of the way people are always willing to deceive themselves.

Unfortunately, Bradbury did not seem to recognize that reading has always been the province of a minority and that television would do little to kill it. More books are written, published, and read today than at any other point in history. Most of them are just redundant filler, but so is 90% of any mass creative output, books, art, movies, or TV, as Sturgeon said. And there's nothing new about that, either: cheap, trashy novels have been a joke since the Victorian.

Television is a different medium than books, and has its own strengths and weaknesses. Bradbury's critique of TV--that it will get larger, more pervasive, and become an escape for small minds--is just as true of books. As for television damaging social interaction, who is less culturally aware: the slack-jawed boy watching television or the slack-jawed boy reading one uninspired relic of genre fiction after another? I read a lot of books as a kid and watched a lot of TV, and each medium provided something different. Neither one displaced the other, since reading and watching aren't the same experience. 

There is an egalitarian obsession that people are all capable of being informed and intelligent. We now send everyone to college, despite the fact that for many people, college is not a viable or useful route. The same elitism that values degrees values being 'well-read', and since this is the elitism of the current power structure, it is idealized by the less fortunate subcultures. Bradbury became informed not because he read, but by what he read. He could have read a schlocky pop novel every day for life and still been as dull as the vidscreen zombies he condemns.

He has mistaken the medium for the message, and his is a doubly mixed message, coming from a man who had his own TV show."
1310,Read with Sandee „Éª‚ù•„Éª,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Nov 02, 2011",5,"Wallflower (noun)

a shy or retiring person who remains unnoticed at social events, especially a woman without a dance partner


I decided to read this book not because there was going to be a movie coming out soon.
It one of the reasons but then again it wasn‚Äôt the main one.
I wanted to read it because the word ‚Äúwallflower‚Äù caught my attention.

I was a wallflower.
I was not one of those kids people notice immediately.
I was one of those people who blends in very well that I was no longer noticeable.
I was a ‚Äúnobody‚Äù.
I was one of those uncool kids back in high school that almost no one spoke to because I always kept to myself.
I was insecure.
I was scared that if I try to talk no one would listen.
Actually I think I still am even though I am already working.
I am still a ‚Äúnobody‚Äù here.
I have a couple of friends but it seems like no one really knows who I really am because I never let them find out who I really was.
They know my name and a couple of unimportant things but I think that‚Äôs about it.
They don‚Äôt really care about the things I like, the things that make me cry, the things that make me smile.
I was just another person they knew by name but never really knew at all.

Perks of Being a Wallflower has to be one of the books that I could relate to.
It was very insightful and poignant that in most part of this book I felt like it was me writing those letters.

Charlie (the main character) and I don‚Äôt have very much in common but still I found myself relating to his situation almost all throughout the book.
I was not as introverted nor was I as smart as he was but there was something about how the author wrote him that you‚Äôll start to see the world through his eyes.
You‚Äôll see how innocent and pure his outlook was in life.

Charlie wasn‚Äôt normal and he knew it.
He was struggling after the death of his favorite Aunt.
He tried his best to ‚Äúparticipate‚Äù but there is still this part of him that would be locked away from everyone else.
Charlie was a freshman and he still has a lot of things to learn.
Hanging out with Patrick and Sam (who were both seniors) exposed him to a lot of things he wasn‚Äôt used to (like smoking, drinking, making out those sort of stuff).
His letters mirrors the experience or the things we went through during his first year in high school.

As I was saying earlier I loved this book a lot because I related much with not only the character but with the whole story.
We may not be like Charlie but the things he went through in high school were something almost everyone went through.
I didn‚Äôt do drugs nor did I smoke a lot when I was in high school.
But some kids were motivated in doing so by peer pressure but in Charlie‚Äôs case I think it was more of curiosity rather than peer pressure.
This book showed us how a special kid like Charlie would cope with being in high school and overcoming the problems he would encounter as he goes along.

Another thing I loved about this book was how it was written.
Though it was written back in the 90‚Äôs when you read it, you‚Äôll get this impression that it was just written recently in a 90‚Äôs setting.
This book was transcend time.
When you read it probably in the next 10 years you would still be able to relate to it.

There were a lot of good quotations in this book but one really stood out for me:

So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.

We are all different.
We are also all the same.
Most of us may not be as smart as Charlie or as popular as Brad (who I think was an a**hole) but all of us can still make a difference.
We may be experiencing troubles right now but that could change based on the decisions or choices that we would make.

I don‚Äôt think this is much of a review but more of a rant.
Sorry my dear readers if this review disappointed you but I kind of like sharing my thoughts about a book that I really connected with.
This book was one of them.

I give this book 5 wonderful glittery stars!"
1311,‚Ä¢ Lindsey Dahling ‚Ä¢,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ,"Apr 27, 2018",5,"I am always ready to pop off on anyone who says they don‚Äôt like this book because ‚ÄúHarry is so angsty and annoying in it.‚Äù Well, why don‚Äôt you watch a peer die right next to you, witness Adolf Hitler‚Äôs resurrection, have a trusted adult admit they‚Äôve been lying and manipulating you, and then get sent home for three months to live with people who loathe you, all while being ghosted by the people you actually like for weeks AND SEE HOW WELL YOU DEAL WITH IT.

On top of all of that, you‚Äôve got a government publishing daily articles detailing why you‚Äôre a crazy person with an overactive imagination and to pay no attention to that 100% alive noseless man behind the curtains.

  

DON‚ÄôT EVEN WITH ME ON THIS.

Also, I still remember reading this book on my bunk bed in 8th grade the day it came out. Never in my life had I experienced so much fiery rage toward a fictional character. Fifteen years later and Delores Umbridge still wins the award for character whOSE LAUGH COULD ACTUALLY PROVOKE ME, A PACIFIST WHO LOVES CAPS LOCK, TO RAGE PUNCH AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER. 

Hem hem."
1312,Jo (The Book Geek),Les Mis√©rables,"Feb 27, 2017",5,"This is the longest book I've ever read (one might call it a beast) and it is without a shadow of a doubt, the best book I've ever been privileged enough to read. I mean, WOW. I struggle to put into words how I feel about this. Hugo had me smiling, laughing and most of the time crying, all in one chapter. This is in no way a happy tale, as one can probably tell by the title, but it has affected me more than I had anticipated. Hugo certainly knows how to captivate the reader, and captivate, he did. 

""The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories, that it has come to be disbelieved in. Few people dare now to say that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each other. Yet it is in this way that love begins, and in this way only.‚Äù 

The character of Jean Valjean, is somewhat of an inspiration. He shows us all, that we are only human, regardless of what we did in the past. We can redeem ourselves, and people do indeed, change. 

I am a die-hard fan of the West end show of Les Miserables. It is most definitely my favourite show. The show tells the story well, 
but there is a hell of a lot missed out in comparison to the book. The book goes into tremendous detail, and for me, made the already grim tale, even more grim! This is not a negative aspect at all, as in my opinion, I think the realisation of everything that is happening, hits you harder.

""Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.‚Äù 

Granted, this book is a beast, but it really is worth the time and commitment that it takes to read it! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!

"" And by the way, Monsieur Marius, I believe that I was a little bit in love with you."" 

There are not enough stars in existence, in order for me to give this book it's true rating, so I'll just have to give the book five stars, and acknowledge the book's wonderful existence daily as it takes pride of place on my bookshelves. Thank you Victor Hugo, for breaking and mending my heart in 1232 pages."
1313,Kyle Nakamura,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"Mar 11, 2008",5,"This has to be, hands down, one of the best science fiction books written. Ender's Game is set in a disarmingly straightfoward sci-fi setting: a near future earth threatened by a hostile alien species with superior technology that seems determined to destroy the human race. The story centers on a young boy who is drafted into an all-consuming military training program at the age of 6. The program he's inducted into seeks to forge a new generation of military commanders out of gifted children, and it's sole purpose is to break them at any cost, until they finally discover someone who can't be broken. What follows is an emotionally complex and at times painfully familiar story of children struggling to accept their inner demons. Ender in particular is cursed with a brutal combination of profound empathy for others, and an overwhelming survival instinct that drives him to win no matter what the cost. It is this combination of gifts that may make him the commander the fleet needs in it's war against the alien invaders, but only if Ender can find a way to survive the burden of understanding his enemy so thoroughly that he can no longer see them as ""the other,"" but as a reflection of himself.
 The story is fast-paced, and Card's signature style of simple, plain language and streamlined descriptiveness serves to bring the characters front and center at all times. This book is infused with a very real sense of psychological and spiritual dislocation, and treats it's young protagonists as fully realized, intelligent, 3 dimensional characters struggling with very adult questions. Card's other signature: creating drama through ethical dilemmas, is also a central element of the story, and he does a very good job of challenging the reader to find some semblance of moral high ground anywhere. The conflicts between characters are made all the more powerful by the almost total lack of mystery: motivations and intent are laid out very clearly in most cases, and it is the reader's ability to empathize with everyone's point of view that makes the story less about winning and loosing and more about living with the consequences of either. 
 This book is thought provoking, emotionally complex, and ethically challenging. It's a powerful examination of conflict and violence, military necessity, family roles, and the ways in which we use the idea of ""the other"" to justify all manner of savagery."

1316,Mike (the Paladin),Dracula,"Sep 28, 2009",5,"I believe this may be the edition I read ""first"". This is an amazing book. I've read reviews by those who disagree and reviews by those who hated the format. But I was swept up in it the first time I read it as a teen and have been every time since. 

My advice is don't worry about all the psychological baggage that has been tacked on over the years...and please don't confuse the movie ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" with the actual plot, story, and characters in the book. It doesn't remotely resemble the book and the title has galled me since that movie came out. The book is far, far better.
I believe it's worth noting that a lot of the psychological baggage that has been attached to this volume probably tells you more about the ones attaching it than the book. 

This book creates a horror atmosphere that has been copied constantly over the years but never quite captured again. You'll be experiencing with Harker the castle and what he faces there. Battling the Count in England...and the terror of the ship's crew that carried his earth boxes across the sea, all will stay with you. Again let me urge you no matter how well any movie has been done, if the movie Dracula is the only one you know, you haven't met the proto-vampire who resides in this book. He/it still walks through literature and even more in the dark fears that lurk in the back of our minds when we're alone on a stormy night or we have to walk alone past that old rundown graveyard (not cemetery) where the city has never gotten around to installing those street lights.

This isn't Twilight, nor is it Buffy the vampire Slayer, there aren't any friendly, helpful, romantic vampires here. (None sparkle either) There is quite probably a reason (or maybe more than one) why we wish so badly to laugh at this book. It does what it does very, very well...and that's be frightening. 

This book is a classic that has been around for over a hundred years..there's a reason for that.

""We"" just read this in the Supernatural Readers group...and I still like it. LOL"
1317,Ilse,The Great Gatsby,"Mar 12, 2021",5,"Bright lights, big city


When I avowed my disenchantment with Tender Is the Night, a few GR friends urged me to read The Great Gatsby to truly appreciate F. Scott Fitzgerald. I cannot but admit The Great Gatsby was a far more exhilarating read than I had expected it to be, its tight composition and restless pace a remarkable contrast with the muddled slow mess that made Tender Is the Night hard for me to get through, the exquisite, visual opulent writing more than in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button unfurling in all its grandeur, alternating the scrumptious and the gritty, just like the narrative unfolding more coherently. 

Reading The Great Gatsby immediately after Tra donne sole (among women only) by Cesare Pavese, featuring also some bored socialites as seen by an outsider who almost unwillingly turns into an insider, it struck me how little difference living in 1922 New York or fifties Turin seemed to make, at least for a certain class of people, the ones leisured and wealthy ‚Äì however Pavese‚Äôs women seem more despondent and philosophical, responding to the shallowness of their lives by cynicism, nihilism or suicide. 

F. Scott Fitzgerald paints brightly lit places, populated by shady people. Daisy and Tom Buchanan, Jay Gatsby, Jordan Baker and the outsider-insider narrator Nick Carraway are a fine fleur of unlovable, amoral and superficial characters, representatives of old and new money being equally dreadful, reducing friendships and loving relationships to commodities, cheating and lying themselves through their lives, crooks, dishonest to the core, whether in golf, in business or in relationships, so corrupt that even the narrator who conspicuously prides himself on his honesty makes himself untrustworthy by doing so. These are people who are moved to tears by a soft rich heap of beautiful shirts ordered from England, in the meantime thoughtlessly wrecking other people‚Äôs lives without even blinking (Pavese‚Äôs novel also pivots around haute couture). 

They were careless people... they smashed up things and creations and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness... and let other people clean up the mess they had made.

Among many other things, the Great Gatsby is also tale of the ludicrous things we do for love (and which inevitably will leave us with empty hands), a painful story about holding on to illusions against one‚Äô s better judgment and a cautionary tale on the (at that time perhaps) quintessential American belief in the malleability of the individual, the American dream, at which I am aware as a European I can only look at from a unbridgeable distance, bemused at a cultural trope which feels alien to me. Reading The Great Gatsby as a trenchant commentary on this belief however, Fitzgerald to my surprise struck me as a sheer visionary, illustrating sharply the downsides and dangers of this belief and capitalist ethos even if he couldn‚Äôt foresee how this pseudo-meritocratic mentality would spread and spill over times and oceans, how it would change societies and poison individuals with it all over the world in the wake of capitalism and neo-liberalism, which would make it into a personal vocation and permanent responsibility to remodel and market oneself to be a worthy individual in a hyper competitive society (and on the flipside blame oneself if one fails to succeed or succumbs under the pressure to achieve and be happy) ‚Äì an ethos conditioning individuals who are made to think of themselves as one-person enterprises, judged by (and judging themselves) by what they have and do rather than what they are. If you are so smart why aren‚Äôt you rich? No wonder people are lonely and struggle with a warped view of the self and feelings of failure (Paul Verhaeghe, What about Me? The Struggle for Identity in a Market-based Society). By Jay Gatsby‚Äôs fate, Fitzgerald exposes the vicious lie that we can be what and who we want to be if we only work on ourselves and that we will be loved if doing so. 



(Illustration: Michelle Lagasca) 

As a counterpoint to all the extravagant and baffling materialism of the world he evokes, F. Scott Fitzgerald gently invites the reader to contemplate past, present and future in a burst of melancholic beauty that will glow on in my mind for a long time. 

""Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors‚Äô eyes‚Äîa fresh, green breast of the new world. 

Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby‚Äôs house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an √¶sthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.

And as I sat there, brooding on the old unknown world, I thought of Gatsby‚Äôs wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy‚Äôs dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.

Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that‚Äôs no matter‚Äîtomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning‚Äî‚Äî

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
1318,Brina,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Apr 03, 2016",5,"With endless books and infinitely more to be written in the future, it is rare occasion that I take the time to reread a novel. As women‚Äôs history month is upon us (2019), I have kept revising my monthly lineup to feature books by remarkable women across the spectrum. Yet, none of these nonfiction books pay homage to the writers of the books themselves. Even with memoirs, the prose focuses on the author‚Äôs achievements in her chosen field. Last week a goodreads friend and I paid tribute to women authors in a daily literary journal. In one of my friend‚Äôs posts, she pointed out that as recently as 1960, the author of the most endearing of American novels had to use a masculinized version of her name in fear of not being published. Nelle Harper Lee of Monroeville, Alabama published To Kill a Mockingbird under her middle name, so only those well read readers are aware of the author‚Äôs full name. It is in this regard, that I included Pulitzer and Presidential Medal of Freedom winner Nelle Harper Lee in my Women‚Äôs History month lineup. It is as auspicious of a time as any to reread one of America‚Äôs greatest novels. 

When I was in ninth grade English class, I read Harper Lee‚Äôs novel for the first time. At age fourteen I was hardly a polished writer and struggled with many of the assignments. Yet, I do remember that the top essay in the class focused on the overarching theme of courage and how Harper Lee showed how each of the characters, major and minor, embodied this trait in the trying times associated with the novel. It was courageous of a southern woman to write a novel with this subject matter prior to the passage of the civil rights act. It is of little wonder to me looking back now that she chose to publish under a gender neutral name. Perhaps, she feared a lynch mob or being outcast in her home town. It was a trying time as the federal government asserted itself against states still grieving from the war between the states and holding out as the last bulwarks of white superiority. Harper Lee exhibited as much courage as the characters in her novel, and rightfully was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for her work. As such, being courageous starts from the top and works its way down to each and every character of this timeless work. 

In 1930s rural Maycomb, Alabama people were pretty much set in their way of life. Town folk had received an education and worked as lawyers, doctors, bankers, and businessmen. The country folk may or may not have received an education because they had to work the fields and many were illiterate. Even the majority of those educated white folk still saw themselves as superior to blacks, and few, if any, had the audacity to take a black‚Äôs word over a white‚Äôs even if it were the correct moral thing to do. Yet, the crux of Lee‚Äôs novel is a court case threatening to disrupt this way of life, having the town divide along both racial and moral lines, and having each character step into others‚Äô shoes and view the world from another‚Äôs perspective. Maycomb at the time embodied many rural American cities, isolated from progress as town set in its ways with few people who were willing to see the world from another perspective. One man was, however, a lawyer named Atticus Finch who is among the most revered fictional characters ever created. Even though this court case should not have been his, his superiors selected Atticus to counsel a black defendant because they realized that he was the one man in Maycomb who had both the ability to empathize and the courage to do so. His neighbor Mrs Maudie Atkinson noted that Atticus was the same man in the court house as he was at home and had nothing to fear. A widower, he instilled these values to his children Jeremy Atticus (Jem) and Jean Louise (Scout) from a young age, passing a strong moral compass onto his children. 

In addition to critiquing southern race relations, Lee‚Äôs novel has endeared itself to children with the legend of Boo Radley. From the time they were young, Jem, Scout, and their summer friend Dill had courage to go to the Radley house trying to get Boo to come out even though all the other kids said the house was spooked. Atticus told them to put a halt to these childish games and explained Boo Radley‚Äôs background to them. The town claimed that Boo Radley was a ghost, but perhaps the reason he did not leave the house is because he did not want to. As the children grew older, Atticus warned them that there would be darker times ahead and they would have to be courageous in the face of what people said to them behind their backs. From the time Scout began school in first grade, she inhibited Atticus‚Äô ability to stand up for what was right. Her teacher Miss Robinson was new to Maycomb and did not understand people‚Äôs ways. Scout explained about the Cunninghams, the Ewells, as well as other families at a personal cost to herself. As Scout grew older and was able to step into other people‚Äôs‚Äô shoes more, she grew to understand differences between folks; however, she and Jem realized that differences did not make the world distinctly black and white or right and wrong. During an era when children were looked upon as unintelligent, Scout and Jem were wise beyond their years and following in their father‚Äôs footsteps. 

Harper Lee created strong archetypal characters and had each embody their own courage. Each‚Äôs courage allowed Atticus to teach his children a life lesson that would endure for the rest of their lives. The family‚Äôs neighbor Mrs. Henry Lafayette DuBose demonstrates courage as she battles a final illness. Third grade teacher Mrs. Gates exhibits courage as she teaches Scout‚Äôs class about the rise of Nazism in Germany and th encourages her students to think for themselves about the differences between prejudices at home and abroad. The African American characters all demonstrate strong courage as well. The Finch‚Äôs housekeeper Calpurnia is a bridge between the white and black communities of Maycomb and does not hesitate to teach Scout and Jem life lessons as they arise. The Reverend Sykes welcomes Jem and Scout into his congregation as though they were his own and invites them to sit in the colored balcony at time when segregation was still the law. He risked a lynching and knew that the Finch family could possibly be labeled as negro lovers, yet Reverend Sykes played a small role in proving that one‚Äôs skin color should not determine whether someone is right or wrong. Of course, as part of the overarching story line, Boo Radley can be viewed as the most courageous character of them all. It is through the courage of an author to create characters who will stand up for what is morally right at a large cost to themselves that she created an award winning novel that was ahead of its time for its era. It is little wonder that the courage of these fictional characters has made the novel as beloved as it is today. 

I believe that the courage exhibited by all these characters has made the town of Maycomb, Alabama stand the test of time and remain the timeless classic that it is. Most people can relate to those who have the courage to stand up for what they think is right or to fight against those tougher than them. This character trait has endeared the Finch family to millions of readers and will continue to do so for generations to come. Whenever a person asks what book would you give as a gift or what is the perfect book, To Kill a Mockingbird is my first choice. I find that it is perfect for any time but most appropriate in spring as in addition to courage there is an underlying theme of hope. Harper Lee won the Pulitzer for this timeless classic, and it also won first place in the Great American Read as America‚Äôs best novel. Thus I can think of no better way to honor women‚Äôs history month than with a timeless book that has and will continue to capture the hearts and minds of all of its readers.

1319,Matthew,Jane Eyre,"Jan 08, 2013",4,"I read this book back in High School. I hated it. I thought it was boring and stupid and all I wanted to do was spread the word that this book was terrible and no one should read it. I had it marked one star on Goodreads and it had a home on my least favorite shelf.

Well, I have been waiting years to find the perfect place to use this gif:



I reread in late August, early September 2017. I have to say that I should probably reread everything I read bank in High School to get a better perspective. 

I enjoyed the book quite a bit this time. The story in intricate and dark. Jane Eyre is a tragic hero who does her best through the whole book but keeps encountering unfortunate situation after unfortunate situation. The story held my interest a lot more than some other classic novels I have read. 

My only complaint was a few times certain plot points were belabored. I found myself saying, ""Okay, I get it, let's move on.""

Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,"Jun 13, 2011",5,"Given that Tolkien did not just invent a world, new creatures and weapons, but invented an actual freaking language, he gets 5 stars from me (I'm sure he was anxiously awaiting my approval). I could do without the 80 pages on tobacco production, but Tolkien wasn't writing a story; he was writing a history of a place that had never existed. I resisted reading them for years as I thought they were a level of dork I was not ready for. Then I saw the first movie and had to know what happened. I'm so happy I did (if I had only seen the movie's incredibly poor tactical decisions I would have thought Tolkien a moron). An incredible work."
1321,Lu√≠s,Romeu e Julieta,"Jul 04, 2020",4,"I will be less tedious than some in this famous play because everything has already been said, or almost!
I read Romeo and Juliet late after seeing two different versions of the play, one in the open air in a very refined natural setting, the other in a classical theatre, all in drapes and shimmering costumes.
Tasty verbal jousts, a ferocious and irremediable hatred, a pure, whole, and heroic love, an unjust sacrificial death but triumphing over human stupidity, finally reconciling the enemy families on the corpses of their children.
This play was a tragically epic, undeniably exhilarating, and utterly timeless work."

 ‚ÄúNature‚Äôs first green is gold, 
Her hardest hue to hold. 
Her early leaf‚Äôs a flower; 
But only so an hour. 
Then leaf subsides to leaf. 
So Eden sank to grief, 
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.‚Äù 


Last week my son came home from school and informed me he had a homework assignment about the book his class is reading as a group. Said child was forlorn that he would be unable to complete the assignment as the editions of the book were for ‚Äúclass use only‚Äù and were not permitted to be taken home. ‚ÄúNever you fear,‚Äù I said to the young boy, ‚Äúfor I have a LIBRARY CARD!!!!!!‚Äù (while actually freaking out that I might have to: (i) change out of my ‚Äúcomfy‚Äù clothes, (ii) move my slothlike self off of the sofa after a hard day at work, or (iii) embarrass the child by refusing to change out of P.J. pants whilst chauffeuring him to pick up a hard copy of the book). I asked the small boy (with much trepidation) ‚Äúwhat book do you need?‚Äù and he answered ‚ÄúThe Outsiders.‚Äù I was filled with glee and assured my son I could easily help him with any questions about that book as I read it a bunch of times myself 800 years ago when I was a young girl. The boy was dubious, so in order to ease his mind I searched the interwebs and was thrilled to find out The Outsiders was available in Kindle format from the library. Whilst waiting for the book to load on to the Kindle, I turned to my son and said the following words:


 ‚ÄúWhen I stepped out into the bright sunlight, from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home . . .‚Äù


Followed by:

 ‚ÄúBLAM! TAKE THAT SUCKA! STILL WANT TO TANGLE WITH THE MEMORY OF THIS OLD LADY? YEAH, I DIDN‚ÄôT THINK SO, NOW WHAT‚ÄôS YOUR QUESTION?‚Äù

The boy was able to pick my geriatric brain for assistance with his homework and it turned out the book wasn‚Äôt really a requirement in order to get the assignment done in the first place. (Note to all of you youngsters who do not yet have children of you own ‚Äì THEY ARE WILEY MOFOS AND EVEN THE MOST HONOR-ROLL-A-RIFIC KID WILL AT SOME POINT GO TO ANY AND ALL LENGTHS TO AVOID HOMEWORK.) Thus, I found myself left with The Outsiders on the Kindle and it was seriously begging me to put down the crappy book I was currently reading and take a trip down memory lane. So that‚Äôs just what I did . . . 





It was just as good as I remembered it. The Outsiders is the quintessential teenage story about love and loss and family and right and wrong and good and bad. I read it in an evening, sitting outside during a sunset, as one should do if given the opportunity. It proved to be timeless, it still made me teary-eyed after all these years, and I still thought it had one of the best ensemble cast of characters ever put to paper. 





And then I remembered it was written by a teenager - one of those awful things that lives in my house and makes my hair turn gray. So let me wrap up this non-review kind of review with a personal note: To my son, I ask you to recognize everything I do for you is with love, just like Darry Curtis and Ponyboy, and I promise I will do everything in my power to make you ‚Äústay gold‚Äù as long as possible."
1323,Tamara,The Book Thief,"Jul 07, 2007",5,"I give this 5 stars, BUT there is a disclaimer: If you want a fast read, this book is not for you. If you only like happy endings this book is not for you. If you don't like experimental fiction, this book is not for you. 

If you love to read and if you love to care about the characters you read about and if you love to eat words like they're ice cream and if you love to have your heart broken and mended on the same page, this book is for you. 

This story is narrated by Death during World War II, and it is the story of a young German girl who comes of age during one of the most horrific times in recent history. Death has a personality. If something bad is about to happen, Death warns you ahead of time. My favorite part is when ""he"" stomps on a framed picture of Hitler on his way to retrieve a thousand souls from a bomb raid. Death is trying to understand the human race as much as the humans are. When ""his"" job becomes unbearable, he watches the color of the sky as he gathers the souls and carries them away. The descriptions of the sky are like nothing I've ever read. 

A few quotes: In years to come, he would be a giver of bread, not a stealer - proof again of the contradictory human being. So much good, so much evil. Just add water. p.164

The town that afternoon was covered in a yellow mist, which stroked the rooftops as if they were pets and filled up the streets like a bath. p.247

He was more a black suit than a man. His face was a mustache. p.413

He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It's his only detriment. he steps on my heart. He makes me cry. p.531

There was once a strange, small man. He decided three important details about his life: 
1. He would part his hair from the opposite side to everyone else. 
2. He would make himself a small, strange mustache. 
3. He would one day rule the world. 
...Yes, the Fuhrer decided that he would rule the world with words. p.445"
1324,Nancy,The Outsiders,"Jan 14, 2008",5,I loved The Outsiders when I read it as a teen and again when I read it just a few months ago. S. E. Hinton created a believable and engaging cast of characters who struggle with conflict in and out of their gang and learn the meaning of friendship and family. A very moving and enjoyable story!
1325,Zo√´,The Outsiders,"Sep 08, 2020",0,"Read for the third time for my YA class in grad school! I've read it twice before - once on my own in 2014 and once for my undergrad YA lit class in 2017.

1327,Kevin Ansbro,Of Mice and Men,"Oct 06, 2015",5,"A book I'd read an awfully long time ago, when pocket calculators were still the latest thing.
Such an iconic staple of American literature, wherein George and Lennie, migrant labourers in the Cali dustbowl, form an unlikely bond in a tale of brutality and tenderness.
Typical of Steinbeck, his 'no-fucking-about' narrative fast-tracks his examination of human morality, culminating in a story that has since been immortalised on film and stage.
Steinbeck strived for gritty realism and wrote about a time and a place, with all of its triumphs and evils. Hidden messages shadow the narrative, chiefly one of morality. He depicted an America that existed, not the one that he would have liked."

           I have a serious love/hate relationship with this book. The good stuff:
I really liked the jumps back and forth in time - surprisingly, the author was able to keep it all straight and I never really felt so terribly confused that I just wanted to give up.

I loved the Henry character. I really loved him. He was flawed, he tried so hard to be a good man, etc etc. I just really loved this character.

I liked the love story - I felt that the feelings between the two of them were real and so deep. So often a love story goes for huge dramatics to prove the deep love between two people and 
I liked that she didn't do that - you see their love for each other in what they do, how they talk, how they touch.

I liked how the author kept the time traveling dark - the idea that he has no money and no clothes and has to scramble to stay alive and not arrested, etc etc. was great - very realistic for an unreal premise.

I actually liked that they threw in the genetic testing and whatever of the time traveling disorder. I know many people felt that it was ridiculous, or felt like it was just shoved in there, but I really thought it brought a realism to the story. It helped take the story out of the sci-fi realm and put it more in reality. All of a sudden it became about a person with a disease and a family fighting to hold it together rather than a mysterious hole in the universe. I don't normally like pseudo science, but I actually thought it worked here.


The bad stuff:

I hated the name dropping, etc. I know some people liked it, but I just hated it. Yeah, I get it - he liked punk music. Wow. It just felt so contrived and fake to me. It felt more like the AUTHOR likes punk music and art and architecture and whatever else and was putting in those names as a shout out to her ""peeps"". Like, hey guys, if you know who this is you are part of a super secret cool club - yeah!! Not so much.

I thought the Claire character was criminally flat. I agree with another reviewer that said the book was called ""The Time Traveler's WIFE"" and yet she is mostly a non-character. Now, I don't have a problem with the idea that she ended up devoting her life to Henry. That her commitment to him overshadowed other choices she could have made in life - well, I thought that was pretty realistic and understandable. If her husband got in a car crash and was a vegetable for the rest of his life, and to take care of him she ended up having to forgo many choices and let her life be dictated by this man and his medical needs, we wouldn't be arguing as much about it. But that doesn't mean she doesn't have her own dreams, thoughts, needs, desires, etc. which the author could have spent more time dealing with and developing. I really felt that Claire was mainly there as an object for Henry to love - not her own person. You never feel that Claire loved Henry and made this choice, this sacrifice - you feel that it was inevitable because the author said so.

Claire's family was ridiculously flat. If Claire was not developed enough, her family wasn't developed at all. They are pretty much cardboard cut outs of stereotypes propped up at certain points in the story to help keep the plot going. And where the heck do they live again that EVERYONE has money. Not just money, but Money. 

I got sick and tired of the pregnancies and miscarriages. How many times before you realize you are harming yourself and your husband to the point that you will never recover? Given what happens to him and all - aren't their lives hard enough?? Why do that to yourselves over and over? I understand the strong desire for a child, but why not adopt? Why was that not an option? I can't remember at that point if they knew it was a genetic disorder or not - but if they did, would they really want that for their child - wouldn't that be even more of a reason to adopt? And what the heck were they going to tell that child?? Given how talky the characters were, I was pretty surprised that there were no heartfelt discussions of how exactly they were going to raise a child in that type of environment and what they would tell other people, etc,

I really didn't like the abrupt cut from the grief on Henry dying to her being 85. That is a lot of time to cover and it felt cheap to not give even a token synopsis of how her and her daughter dealt with his death and her having the same disorder. I honestly can't decide whether her being able to see him one last time (it was him as a younger man jumping way ahead in time, so it was the past for Henry who was still dead) was touching or cruel. To deal with a devastating loss like that and so much time has gone by and to just have him pop back in like that - are you glad for one more precious moment or is it terribly cruel to give hope and snatch it away? And to do that to the daughter too?? I don't know.....

My feelings about the ending depend on my mood. Somedays I feel that the ending was depressing but realistic. Not everything has a happy ending and I hate it when movies and TV show that ANY problem can be solved in 30 minutes! So having something real, even if difficult, felt right. Other days I feel like it was crap. Sure life isn't always great but it isn't always crap either. And I hate fatalism like that - I hate the idea that life is crap and there is no escaping it. 

I was also annoyed with Henry quitting - just giving up on life for so long after the feet thing. I get that he was depressed and all. I do. But he has lived his whole life not being able to depend on anything - not where he will wake up, not if he'll have money, not be able to see or be with the people he loves, having to be deposited in the middle of no where and scramble for clothes, food and money with no idea when and where he will return? This is a man who is incredibly resourceful and resilient. I just had a hard time believing that he would quit like that. Then again, I would imagine all those years of doing just that would take a toll on him and that was the final blow he just couldn't handle. But no, I still think it was out of character.


And the truly terrible

The two things that are just atrocious in this book - the references to her families black servants and Henry's friend and downstairs neighbor growing up, Kimmy. Wow. Holy Stereotypes batman!! Even given Claire's family having money and being upper crust and all - the whole description of them and the black servants was so odd and anachronistic. Wait - when did we all time travel to 1776?? Why is Mammy here? And with Henry's downstairs neighbor - she was slightly better written and I enjoyed her character in relation to Henry and all, but again, she was so stereotypical with the broken en-ga-rish and all. I don't know how she got away with those representations at all - how did not one editor or something say,"" uh, Audrey, could we talk about these ethnic characters? They might be a little too ethnic."" Seriously. Absurd.

So that is it- I loved parts of this book and hated parts of this book. There was a lot that was well done and some that was criminal. I don't know if I wish someone else had taken this idea and written it or if I wish the author had held onto this idea until she had more books under her belt and could do it justice. Either way, I just can't truly recommend this book but I can't tell people to avoid it either. AARGH!"
1329,Elle (ellexamines),The Hunger Games ,"Oct 01, 2016",5,"spoilers but do y‚Äôall remember that scene in book two where all of the victors are being interviewed and keep saying shit that cuts right to the capitol‚Äôs bone, all really purposefully overdramatic, and then right after Katniss gets up and that shit with the Dress happens (which she instantly knows is a life sacrifice one of her only friends is making for her) Peeta gets up on that stage and makes a normal speech and then ends it with ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be fine, if it weren‚Äôt for the baby‚Äù like when is literature ever going to reach those peaks of bad bitch energy ever again

I think this series is so fascinating in that it basically spurred an entire genre of sort-of-okay YA dystopians and then a lot of really bad YA dystopians, and it gets put a lot into that category. but... this book doesn‚Äôt have any of those same problems that so plagued YA dystopian fiction.

The love triangle being pointless is quite literally the point; Gale and Peeta are meant to represent the opposite sides of war (something a certain plot point in book three really drives home). Katniss is frankly never romantically interested in either for almost all of books one and two; she grows to care about Peeta in the general sense, not just the romantic sense. The eventual romance works for Katniss because it is safe for her. 

(What I‚Äôm saying is this was tenderness.)

I more think this series is interesting in how it talks about the nature of power and the nature of uprising. The uprising, as a whole, is an upswelling of the people, a realization that there is strength in numbers. Yet some of the most revolutionary actions of this series are individual ‚Äî it takes Katniss‚Äô desire to save her sister to start a war, Katniss‚Äô love for little Rue to create horror, Cinna‚Äôs willingness to sacrifice his life to create a symbol. Even during war, the individual lives of characters like Joanna and Haymitch and Finnick matter. They matter to the narrative, and thus they matter to us too. 

(view spoiler)[The ending of book three is essentially a moment in which Katniss realizes that in taking out an old source of power, a new dictator has sprung up in his place on the same level of authoritarianism. I‚Äôm going to say it: the moment in which she chooses to shoot Coin is honest to god one of the best moments in literary history. (hide spoiler)]

Katniss Everdeen is still a deeply revolutionary heroine not only in that she‚Äôs written to be fairly gender non-conforming but also in that she is outwardly cold to all but her very few favorite people, and the narrative does not see fit to punish her for it, but to empathize with her and allow her to grow naturally in small ways. Her journey is not in becoming a Nice Person but in self-actualization. That is not a journey female characters are ever ever ever allowed to take and is arguably still something new. 

I almost want to case study this. It‚Äôs a similar dynamic to Lord of the Rings being blamed for the general problems of late-1900s fantasy... but worse, because criticism of the YA dystopian genre so often fell into somewhat misogynistic areas, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any point in denying that The Hunger Games, due to having an image as Something Young Women Enjoyed‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, received far more criticism than its equivalents in other genres. 

It's crazy that the first big ya dystopia is the best ya dystopia and one of the best series of all time, but this one is truly a classic and remains so incredible. Thank you to Katniss Everdeen for being one of the most interesting characters ever written and to this book for having such a dynamic story.

üîçTOP THREE REASONS TO READ THG

1. It's relevant to our world. The parallels to our own society are so amazingly drawn, and the worldbuilding so good, that I'm not surprised this book was the one that broke through. 
2. Dramatic tension. Tell me you weren't on the edge of your seat every moment of this book. You're lying. Katniss' struggle to survive on her own is compelling and twisty. Every moment is filled with fear and tension. 
3. The characters are amazing. Katniss Everdeen is one of the best developed, most intriguing protagonists ever written. She's badass and she's selfish and she takes no shit. In the end, I think that's what made this series so fantastic and popular."
1330,Martine,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Feb 16, 2008",2,"I must have missed something. Either that, or some wicked hypnotist has tricked the world (and quite a few of my friends, it would seem) into believing that One Hundred Years of Solitude is a great novel. How did this happen? One Hundred Years of Solitude is not a great novel. In fact, I'm not even sure it qualifies as a novel at all. Rather it reads like a 450-page outline for a novel which accidentally got published instead of the finished product. Oops.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not disputing that Marquez has an imaginative mind. He does, unquestionably. Nor am I disputing that he knows how to come up with an interesting story. He obviously does, or this wouldn't be the hugely popular book it is. As far as I'm concerned, though, he forgot to put the finishing touches to his story. In his rush to get the bare bones on paper, he forgot to add the things which bring a story alive. Such as, you know, dialogue. Emotions. Motivations. Character arcs. Pretty basic things, really. By focusing on the external side of things, and by never allowing his characters to speak for themselves (the dialogue in the book amounts to about five pages, if that), Marquez keeps his reader from getting to know his characters, and from understanding why they do the things they do. The lack of characterisation is such that the story basically reads like an unchronological chronicle of deeds and events that go on for ever without any attempt at an explanation or psychological depth. And yes, they're interesting events, I'll grant you that, but they're told with such emotional detachment that I honestly didn't care for any of the characters who experienced them. I kept waiting for Marquez to focus on one character long enough to make me care about what happened to him or her, but he never did, choosing instead to introduce new characters (more Aurelianos... sigh) and move on. I wish to all the gods of fiction he had left out some twenty Aurelianos and focused on the remaining four instead. With three-dimensional characters rather than two-dimensional ones, this could have been a fabulous book. As it is, it's just a shell.

What a waste of a perfectly good story."
1331,Lyn,Lord of the Flies,"Jul 31, 2011",4,"Years after I read this masterpiece, it is still chilling. 

Golding spins a yarn that could have been told centuries ago, primal human nature unmoored from civilization does not take long to break away and devolve into a feral thing.

As good today, and as haunting, as it was when it was published in 1954. This should be on a list of books that must be read.

** 2018 addendum - it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which I frequently think."
1332,Rebecca Watson,Ender‚Äôs Game ,"May 01, 2013",2,"Once upon a time, there was a tiny 6-year old boy who all the other kids picked on. Little did they know that he was very special and all the adults secretly loved him even though they didn't stop anyone from picking on him, and also he knew karate and he didn't want to hurt them but he would if he had to, and it just so happens that he has to. Often. Also he spoke and thought not like a 6-year old boy but as a smug 30-year old man with a fair amount of unresolved bitterness toward his childhood.

I finished this book very quickly, not because I am a misunderstood supergenius toddler, but because if I lost any momentum at all, I'd put this book down and never again be able to screw up the energy to deal with the pretentious little prick known as Ender Wiggin. 

I really wanted to like the book. The basic outline of the story is fine and even appealing to me: kids being trained with video games from an early age to join a war effort. But the writing was, at times, excruciating. To be fair, had I read it when I was a (fairly average, I'm sure) 12-year old, I probably would have found it more enjoyable. But as an (average, again) adult, I found it to be about 100 pages too long and filled with long passages during which I developed a loathing of the main character at precisely the moment when the author clearly wanted me to admire his cleverness, strength of character, and bold moral wrestling. ""Ooh, how deftly he wins the admiration of his peers by suggesting that bully is gay! Aah, the psychological pain he endures at being the best at strategy and physical combat! Oh, the bravery of joking with the black boy about how he's a n****r! Oh why can't he find a teacher who can teach him something he doesn't already know!""

I was also continuously distracted by sentences like, ""They pushed his face backward into the door."" What does that mean? If they're pushing his face backward, does that mean his head hit the door? His face can't hit the door if it's not facing it.

Anyway. The final act started off well enough and brought everything to a satisfactory conclusion, and then the book continued on for another 25 pages that should be considered by nerds to be as unconscionable as the final episode of Battlestar Gallactica, where all reason and logic are dispensed with in favor of some weird fantasy that pretends to wrap up everything in a nice and neat bow.

It's interesting to compare this to Dune, which I read last month. Dune does a similar thing (young adult-style writing about a young boy with great powers who will save the world) but does it without making the main character insufferable. Unlike Dune, I don't think I'll bother reading any other books about Ender, the universe's tiniest supergenius."
1333,Lisa,Crime and Punishment,"Jul 11, 2017",5,"What a sensational reading experience, what an unconditional surrender to an atmosphere of fear, anxiety and confusion - and to an epic battle of wills! 
 
Rarely these days do I read with that kind of hopeless, helpless feeling of being completely, utterly lost in the imaginary world. From the first moment, when Raskolnikov steps out on the street and begins wandering around in Petersburg, to the very last pages, I live with the characters, I am part of the story, I have my own opinions, and argue against their actions, in my head, while reading on in a frenzy. 

What can I say?
 
There has been enough said of Raskolnikov‚Äôs murky motives for doing what he does. I don‚Äôt agree with him at all, neither with the theory he proposes, nor with the idea that he can expiate his crime through intense suffering. I hate the nonchalance with which he discards the murderee - ‚Äúa louse‚Äù - as an unimportant detail in the bigger picture of him, his character, his suffering ego, and his ultimate redemption and resurrection as a ‚Äúnew man‚Äù. 

Even if the pawnbroker is not a sympathetic character, she is an independent woman, who provides for herself, without having to sell her body to a husband or a pimp. She is not a ‚Äúlouse‚Äù, and by killing her out of vanity, pride, self-promotion, delusion or hubris, Raskolnikov destroys her. It is not the devil‚Äôs work, as Raskolnikov says at one point. A great man should be better able to take responsibility for his own actions. It is Raskolnikov himself who knowingly, condescendingly, makes the calculation that an ugly, businesslike old woman does not have any value in herself. Of course not, Raskolnikov! Neither does Shylock in The Merchant Of Venice! Not part of the mainstream community, they don‚Äôt count, in the name of law and justice and compassion. It takes a Shakespeare or a Dostoyevsky to point that out without sounding preachy and moralist, and without siding with one character against another.

In a world in which women are property, the unattractive pawnbroker is meaningless, unless you turn her riches into your property. As for the brutal killing, with an axe? A mere trifle in the context!

But as Dostoyevsky might well be one of the most brilliant authors ever describing an evil character, I commiserate with the scoundrel, with the egomaniac, charismatic murderer. I feel for him, with him, in his dramatic stand offs with Pyotr Petrovich, his intellectual counterpart. Their verbal exchanges evoke the image of two predators circling each other, working on their own strategies while calculating the enemy‚Äôs.

I suffer with the psychopath, and take his side, even when I disagree with him. Such is the power of Dostoyevsky‚Äôs storytelling genius. He creates characters with major flaws, and very different positions, and he gives all of them their space, their say, their moment on stage. And when they appear, they have the audience‚Äôs full attention. 

Dostoyevsky lets a cynical self-confessed abuser of women commit the one act of charity that actually has a positive impact on three children‚Äôs future. 

He lets a drunkard, the comical character of Marmeladov, who pushes his wife to insanity and his daughter to prostitution, revel in the pleasure of suffering, sounding almost like a philosopher when he cherishes his idea that god will honour the self-sacrifice of the women he has destroyed, and that the same god will indiscriminately have mercy on himself as well, for being so willing to suffer (especially the pulling of hair does a great deal of good, according to Marmeladov, comical effect included!).

Dostoyevsky lets women sacrifice themselves in the name of charity and religion. Needless to say, I have strong opinions about that, and apart from the unspeakable suffering imposed on them in their lifetime, I do not approve of any religious dogma that justifies self-sacrifice as a virtue - in our time of terrorist violence, it seems an almost obscene attitude. Regardless, I suffer with them through the author‚Äôs brilliantly atmospheric narrative.

Dostoyevsky, the sharp psychological mind and analytic, accurately points out the difference between women in the story, sacrificing ‚Äúonly‚Äù themselves, and the violent men, sacrificing others (mostly women, children and innocent, intellectually inferior men) for their own benefit in their delusion that they are extraordinary, and have special rights beyond the law. And he does it so convincingly that the reader feels the urge to argue with the characters. I found myself saying:

‚ÄúBut Raskolnikov, I really don‚Äôt think Napoleon would have killed a pawnbroker with an axe to demonstrate his greatness, that is not the way great men exert their power. And as an anachronistic side note, in these times of newspeakish, American-style greatness, we need to ask ourselves if that is anything to strive for at all.‚Äù

It is a powerful book, and a book about power.

The hypnotic power that a charismatic personality exerts over other people.
The physical power that men exert over women and children.
The mental power that educated people exert over simple minds.
The financial power that wealthy people exert over hungry, poor, miserable people.
The religious power that dogma exerts over people to accept injustice in the hope of scoring high with god in the afterlife.
The linguistic power that eloquence exerts to dominate an entire environment with propaganda.

The individual power to say no. 

Two characters, both women, refuse to play the cards they are dealt. Dounia Romanovna and Katerina Ivanovna - you are my true heroes in this endlessly deep masterpiece of a novel!

Dounia - holding the revolver, ready to kill the man who has lured her into a corner and tries to blackmail her into a sexual relationship! The most powerful scene of all. I shiver while reading. Literally! I have goosebumps! As will power goes, hers is brilliant. No man owns that woman. Thank you for that scene, Dostoyevsky! And she manages NOT to kill, thus showing her spoiled, attention-seeking, impulsive and arrogant brother who is mentally superior despite physical weakness.

Katerina - committing an act of insanity while slowly dying of consumption, and leaving her three children orphans! Instead of hiding herself and suffering in secret, she takes to the streets, forces her misery upon the world, and makes it official. She has all the right in the world to dance, sing and make noise to point to the insanity of society, which creates a platform for a life like hers. And her refusal to receive the greedy priest on her deathbed is simply divine: ‚ÄúGod can take me as I am, or be damned!‚Äù 

Right you are, Katerina!

I could go on in infinity, but I will break off here, just like Dostoyevsky breaks off in medias res, hinting at the untold sequel - the marriage between Raskolnikov and Sonia! Oh, dear, what an emotional roller coaster that must be - it is quite enough to allude to it in an epilogue to make me smile. The brooding murderer and the saintly whore, joined together in holy suffering. Brilliant, even as a vague idea.

Curtain.

Standing, shaking, roaring ovations!"
1334,Cara,The Lightning Thief ,"Dec 16, 2009",5,"Really is there something I could say that hasn't been said? Doubtful, but in utterly stupid human style I will write a review anyway attempting to tell people how cool this book is.

This is plainly an  awesome  idea. I had always wondered what happened to the kids of half gods/goddess and humans. Here's the story to quench your curiosity. Percy Jackson has been dumped around from border school to border school. He has never been quite like anybody else, but as the end of sixth grade approaches he'll find out how unique he actually is...

I picked this up thinking that I would enjoy it, but not to the extent of really being  hooked  so fast. Literally from the first pages I knew I was gonna finish this book. It's geared towards middle grade readers and mostly male I think, but really all that goes away when you're reading this. As an older reader I did see most of the twists coming but that is because the author is generous about hints, which I have always liked. What really sold it for me though is the action. I have mentioned this numerous times, but I'll say it again,  I am a total sucker for action scenes . Give me a good fight sequence and I'm there. 

A few reviews mention how this is ripoff of Harry Potter, and now that I think about it I could see where they are coming from. There are definitely similarities, but to be honest I didn't really catch that, (I guess I'm kind of dim...I shouldn't probably admit to that *shakes head* moving on) because the world the author set was so original that the similar setup can be easily forgiven.

We all love heroes. Especially ones like Percy. People never expect much from him, and that's what makes this journey of his so personal to the reader. You root for him and are so glad that his muscling his way through it. It has the feel of cheering for the underdog. And I'm guessing this underdog is going to blow everyone out of the water.

Extra Note: Oh glorious goodness they made a movie! Here is a link to the movie trailer."
1335,Emily (Books with Emily Fox),The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Aug 02, 2018",2,"It's not you, it's me... well maybe it's also you.

Unfortunately this book wasn't for me. Some of the humor I liked but it was too absurd for me and it was too slow to really start.

I wish I had liked it as much as everyone else but it definitely didn't make it to my ""favorite books of all time"" list!

UPDATE: I finally figured out what was my issue with this book. There's a French movie called ""Rrrrrrr"" (similar humour to Monty Pyton) and I've had way more fun using the jokes out of context with friends than I did actually watching the movie. Recommending it was always a bit weird because it's just an okay movie but... the jokes are funny afterwards. 

This summarizes exactly how I feel about this book!"
1336,s.penkevich,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Sep 24, 2011",5,"‚ÄòIt's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.‚Äô

Few memories of reading a book can match the sweetness of the warm spring day while at university when I sat in the grass down by a river and began Gabriel Garcia Marquez‚Äôs masterful One Hundred Years of Solitude. The novel gripped me immediately and I followed the myth-like tales of the Buend√≠a family and the fictional town of Macondo across multiple generations until the sunlight had vanished, the sound of the river adding an idyllic rhythm to my reading that made me keenly aware of the passage of time the idea of one thing flowing into the next. This novel truly is a tour de force earning its canonization not only as a crucial work of Latin American literature but as an internationally renowned novel of great beauty and insight. The amalgamation of stories all colliding within the novel form a complex web of critical analysis of history that functions as commentary on colonialism, political struggles of war and life under dictatorship, as well as interpersonal issues of family, legacy and love or the lack of it, making this a dense yet delightful novel that will forever reside within the hearts and minds of its readers.

One Hundred Years of Solitude was written in the span of just 18 months but will linger on in immortality as an important work of 20th century literature. It has sold over 50 million copies in over 25 languages (translated into english by the incredible Gregory Rabassa, the former WWII cryptologist was handpicked by Marquez for the task and reportedly said that Rabassa‚Äôs translation was better than his original in Spanish) and continues to charm readers everywhere. It is a cornerstone of modern Latin American Literature that has made Marquez a household name along with Jorge Luis Borges, from whom Marquez drew much inspiration (particularly from the story The Garden of Forking Paths which you can read here and inspired the cyclical ending of the novel). 

Harold Bloom wrote of One Hundred Years of Solitude that ‚ÄòIt is all story, where everything conceivable and inconceivable is happening at once.‚Äô And indeed it does feel as if the whole of life is bursting forth from the book, which is a family epic that spans from the 1820‚Äôs through the 1920‚Äôs. Marquez combines his mythmaking with historical events, using magical realism as a political action of uncovering the meaning hiding in plain sight of historical reality. Carlos Fuentes writes in The Great Latin American Novel that Marquez‚Äôs storytelling serves ‚Äòas an act of knowledge, as a negation of the false documents of the civil state which, until very recently papered over our reality.‚Äô While Marquez says in a 1988 interview ‚Äòthere's not a single line in my novels which is not based on reality,‚Äô it seems to affirm Fuente‚Äôs analysis and point to the reality in storytelling being a method to unlock a reality in life previously unobservable.

 In this manner of magical realism, Marquez can move from tales of extraordinarily large men, women floating away into the sky, or absurdly long rain storms to actual historical events, such as the Banana Massacre when the United Fruit Company (now known as Chiquita) called in the army to massacre striking workers at the request of the US. Through this work and it‚Äôs investigations into US military intervention, dictatorships and revolutionaries, Marquez wrests the official narrative of history from the colonialist lenses that would prescribe a narrative to the Latin American countries they sought to exploit and gives history its own mythological life to function more freely. This also opens the novel up to multiple ways of reading it, where any of the numerous themes could be emphasized.

‚ÄòThe secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude.‚Äô

As one would expect, solitude is a major theme working through the novel, with Buend√≠a's own sense of solitude enlarged in the isolation of Macondo, which is falling apart by the end of the book. The weight of feeling ones country collapsing to external forces is strongly imposed as the novel careens towards conclusion, and as new technologies arrive and different societies begin to integrate, those of the old guard feel more and more isolated from the world. None of this moves in a straightforward manner, however, and the ending reveals history to be a cyclical process, one of constant creation and undoing. ‚Äò...time was not passing...it was turning in a circle‚Ä¶‚Äô

One Hundred Years of Solitude is truly worth the read and holds a very special place in my heart. It is such a fascinating and fantastic blend of magical realism and historical insight that was a major work in world literature. One to read and read again.

BEST SCI-FI'S NOVEL CONTENDER?


I decided to read the novel basically because the incoming film adaptation (it was ""incoming"" at the moment that I read the book) and I wanted to read the original book before of watching the film. 

I am aware of the controversial opinions about sensitive social subjects, but I want to keep that out of this and only commenting about my impressions about the book itself. 

First of all, I doubt highly that the film adaptation will be so crude in certain developments of the story mainly because of that the protagonist of the story is a child. (and I wasn't mistaken about that) 

And commenting about the shock made for the book, it's obvious that it's provoked due that the protagonist is a child. 

This very same story using an adult, even a young adult, and this book wouldn't impress anybody. 



HOW MUCH TIME CHILDREN REMAIN AS CHILDREN NOWADAYS?


However I think that establishing that this is a story set into the future of humankind, I think that how the children think, talk and act here is not far-fetched.

Maybe in 1985 could be...

..., but now? 

Now, children have all the access to internet just like this ""futuristic"" story sets, and now kids got ""mature"" very quickly, not a real maturity per se, but the exposure to so much information in the web and the interaction on social networks, forums, blogs, etc... make them to ""act like adults"" before their time and also it make them to lose sensibility on how treating living things.

So, that angle is very visionary. No doubt about it, and maybe because of that, the book will remain as something relevant to read not matter if we enjoyed the reading or not of it.



A BATTLE SCHOOL SHOULD BE STILL A SCHOOL?


Now, the development.

I found odd that in his life on Battle School, you only get the practices and exercises, and you only read about how Ender learn from his peers and never from the teachers, it's supposed to be a school but you never see how are ""classes"" there.

It's like if he wouldn't get any valuable education from adult teachers. 

The book was really interesting while Ender was still very young but as soon he got a promotion to commander, I think that much of the ""spark"" of the narrative was lost. 



TO BUG OR NOT TO BUG


It's kind of a rule on these military sci-fi stories that they have to battle against insect-like species?

Like on Starship Troopers. I guess that it's easier to get a lot of killing without provoking so much social shock. I am sure that when Peter did some awful things to one single squirrel disturbed a lot of people, me included, but killing insects? 

If a kid kills an animal, it's a sure signal that they have a psychopath on their hands, but killing a cockroach? An ant? A wasp? Unless you are a monk in Tibet, you have kill an infinite quantity of insects on your life and you didn't think twice about it again.

So, the easiest way to make people confortable with massive killing is convincing them that they are not killing sentient life forms but dang bugs.

And, yes, that not only works here, in this book, but in many dark moments in our history."
1338,Emily May,The Book Thief,"Feb 10, 2011",3,"I hate it when this happens, I truly do. 

It makes me feel wrong inside when everyone else loves a book that I find to be underwhelming... I mean, what's wrong with me?? Did I not get it?? Obviously it must be a lack of intelligence or something because everyone seems to rate this 5 stars. I was looking through my friend reviews hoping that someone would share my opinion - at least a tiny bit - and seeing 5 stars, 5 stars, 4.5 stars, 5 stars... 

I can appreciate that Markus Zusak is a very talented writer, some of the phrases he uses are beautiful and highly quotable - more reminiscent of poetry than prose. And the story idea? A tale narrated by Death and set in Nazi Germany... original and ominous. 

But it was the story-telling that never really worked for me. This is one of those incredibly slow, subtle books that are told in a series of anecdotes and are meant to cleverly build up a bigger picture... but the stories just didn't interest me.

I could imagine I was reading a collection of short stories (and not a full-length novel) about playground fights, developing friendships, WWI stories and death. The book felt almost episodic in nature. 

These stories are supposed to come together and form a novel that is all kinds of awesome, but it was so bland. I also think that nearly 600 pages of ""subtlety"" can make you want to throw yourself off the nearest tall building... anyone read To the Lighthouse and spend 99% of it just wishing they'd get to the effin' lighthouse?! 

I'm giving this book 3 stars for the pretty words and the concept. But other than that this book unfortunately won't stay with me. I find it an easily forgettable novel. I'm sorry :(

1339,Jibran,The Alchemist,"Mar 21, 2015",1,"If books were pills, Alchemist would be a sugarcoated placebo with no real effect. Let's call it a feel-good homily. I have never read a book as meretricious as this one. Many reviewers have pointed out the problems with this 'celebrated' novel so I'd rather not expend any more words. Suffice it so say that this is a good example of portentous writing that is best avoided if your benchmark is quality literature."
1340,Nataliya,The Little Prince,"May 02, 2010",5,"*** For those who somehow have no idea about what happens in The Little Prince or cannot figure it out at a reasonable spot in the book, here is a warning - THERE WILL BE, as much as I hate applying this term to this incredibly famous classic that does not rely on Aha! moments to keep the readers' attention, SPOILERS! ****


-----------


'You do understand that the Little Prince died?' my mother asked as carefully and gently as only adults who know that loss of innocence can be crushing but is brutally necessary can do.

'No, he didn't. He went back to his home planet and that stupid rose. It says so right here,' I replied with the comforting stubbornness of an eight-year-old.

Later that night, I quietly reread the book and the sad truth clicked, and so did the belated thought that for all the gentle berating of adults in it, this strange and beautiful book was written by one of them and definitely for them, and not for me, and by luring me in with the beautiful pictures it pushed me just a bit further on the inevitable road to adulthood.

Or so I see now.

Back then, I decided to read the author's biography instead as a distraction from the thoughts that were trying to be a bit more grown-up than my heart cared for - I was the odd kid of a literature teacher mother, after all - just to learn that just after writing this book, Antoine de Saint Exupery died when flying his plane in a war to liberate his country, killed by adults who played a game of war, too dangerous and cruel. And that finally made me cry. 

And then I went back to the simple security of childhood.



Then I grew up, inevitably, like most of us do. I learned to do my fair share of 'matters of consequence'. I learned the painful understanding of why certain vain but naive roses can hold such sad power over our hearts. I learned the comfort and longing of nostalgia, the fear of the crushing burden of loneliness, the understanding of fragile beauty of the world that can be so easily taken away at any moment. I became a grown-up, and I have to learn to reconcile my inner child with my outer age.
""In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.""
Now, reading this intensely lyrical and mesmerizing book written by an ailing middle-aged adult far away from the country he loved in the middle of war-torn years, I am confronted with emotions that ruthlessly hurt, hidden in the deceiving simplicity of a (supposedly) children's story just like an elephant was hidden inside a boa constrictor - or was it simply a hat all along? - in the opening paragraphs of this book. I sigh and tear up, and try to resist the urge to pick up the golden-haired child that never stopped until he got answers to his questions and carry him away into safety. But I can't. Because if I do so, there will never be 500 billion bells in the stars, and we will never wonder whether the rose is still alive - and it needs to be, because we are responsible for those we have tamed.
""But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed.""
This is not a book for children. It's for adults who remember being children and feel nostalgia for the simple comfort of childhood innocence but know they can never go back to it. Because they have met their Roses, and Foxes, and drank from a well with a rusty handle in the desert, and learned that a few thorns may not stand against the claws of a tiger. Unlike the Little Prince, they can no longer go back - but they can look at the night starry sky and laugh, and imagine that they hear an answering clear laughter.
""In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.""



'What makes the desert beautiful,' said the little prince, 'is that somewhere it hides a well.'

while logically i know that is far from my best month / title pun, and is also actually among the worst, and in point of fact that's even worse than it sounds because my puns have never been good...

i like it. and that's that.

we are back for another exciting round of Project Long Classics, in which elle and i find it within our cowardly hearts to brave long books from old times only by dividing them up into teeny-tiny chunks for four entire weeks.

if it works, it works.

i have been putting off reading this for a long time, and i am still very scared, but i do have this joke to get off: one hundred years of solitude? sounds like quarantine, am i right? 

buh dum ch!

okay. i'm ready to get started.

we're also reading this for our book club -
join the discussion here
follow on instagram here

let's go.

DAY 1: PAGES 1-15
it's august 3, i won't lie to you. i could never. my nose would grow. pinocchio was based on a true story from the future about a human woman who writes book reviews.

okay, i'm procrastinating. i'm scared and i have to read 50 pages today!!! sue me!

all right. couple of things: this is beautiful; i have a used copy, acquired at an unknown time but probably 5+ years ago, and it smells good as hell; i'm not catching up today.


DAY 2: PAGES 16-30
okay. honesty hour: it's day 7, and i'm 15 pages into this book. folks...i am SLUMPED. (also i've been busy and i have trouble prioritizing these projects NOTORIOUSLY when i'm busy, but who cares about that part.)

anyway, i've decided i'm ignoring it in order to indulge in my favorite way to spend a sunday: bringing 5-10 books in bed with me and alternating chapters all day, absolutely refusing to so much as make eye contact with another human being. so hopefully we catch up!


DAY 3: PAGES 31-45
okay...dare i say...i'm starting to have fun with this.

i'm definitely liking it more than a good number of the collected stories, i'll say that much.


DAY 4: PAGES 46-60
so far this is giving very much no plot just vibes, and i can't say i'm not into it. and it's a collected stories crossover episode!


DAY 5: PAGES 61-75
the drama!!! sheesh. although you have to respect a classic that just comes right out and admits that nothing in life is more interesting or important than love and sex.

most old books are always pretending it's something boring, like politics, or accounting, or blood feuds.


DAY 6: PAGES 76-90
maybe it's just me, but personally if i were selecting a wife out of everybody i knew, i'd probably pick someone who wasn't still literally wetting the bed. genuinely. not metaphorically.

but that's just my pref.


DAY 7: PAGES 91-105
caught up!!! in our third consecutive hour of reading!!! alternating with 6 other books!!! is there nothing a project cannot do!!!

there is just...so much going on here.


DAY 8: PAGES 106-120
pretty badass behavior happening here...i love it when women


DAY 9: PAGES 121-135 i took major advantage of the included family tree today, i'll say that. hoo boy.


DAY 10: PAGES 136-150
this is like. Intense to read. it never gets natural or easy in the way that most books do, even really old timey ones of major significance.

but it is so damn good.


DAY 11: PAGES 151-165
a lot of these fellas up to no damn good...


DAY 12: PAGES 166-180
did anyone else notice that i accidentally started numbering the days in decreasing order. (now fixed.)

how did that happen?! am i being pranked?? if someone hacked my account, please go to my messages and see how funny it is when men send desperate DMs to faceless book reviewers. i don't wanna be alone in the humor anymore.

anyway. amaranta pulls.


DAY 13: PAGES 181-195
another weekend, another two days i accidentally took off from reading in their entirety.

this is the first time that my 15 page intervals have actually lined up with a chapter. this is the height of luxury!!


DAY 14: PAGES 196-210
this is such a fever-dream way to read a fever-dream book - cut up into senseless little chunks like this. it's already such a discombobulated and nonlinear read, and absolutely refusing to acknowledge chapters or page breaks of any kind is insane!

but fun.


DAY 15: PAGES 211-225
all the women in this book slay...they are very sexualized but also very badass. it's very fun to read about.

caught up!


DAY 16: PAGES 226-240
HOW is ursula still alive. we're on, like, our 8th aureliano.


DAY 17: PAGES 241-255
imagine being so hot it kills literally any man who doesn't leave you alone...

goals.


DAY 18: PAGES 256-270
make that like. 25 aurelianos.

back to 8 again.


DAY 19: PAGES 271-285
URSULA!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU DON'T GO!!!!!!!

i know you're like 200 years old and i just took you for granted like 3 days ago. but still.


DAY 20: PAGES 286-300
since my mourning cry for ursula, multiple people have died but she is not among them?? what a rollercoaster of emotions.

there is a girl whose name is truly Meme in this and she is just as wonderful as her name would indicate. anyway generally the women in this remain discernible and one of a kind and interesting through this whole crazy book, while the men continue to bore me and be absolutely impossible to keep straight.


DAY 21: PAGES 301-315
folks, we're behind again.

because even when my weekends are extremely lazy (read: indoors and conducted in solitude, as is my wont), and even when my weeks consist of little to no reading, something in my soul says that i should take at LEAST one saturday or sunday off entirely. 

i can't help it.


DAY 22: PAGES 316-330
there are like 200 characters in this book and 196 of them have been publicly executed.


DAY 23: PAGES 331-345
ursula somehow still alive and kicking. i love when magical realism is just like...""it rained for four years straight and this woman is like 180 years old.""


DAY 24: PAGES 346-360
under 100 pages to go and i feel confident stating there will never be a plot! and for that reason i have to stan.

i cannot keep these men straight for even one second and yet i could summarize each female character in a paragraph by first name alone. it's the misandrist in me. also the fact that every man has one of two names. but still.


DAY 25: PAGES 361-375
aaaand it's an almost-no-paragraph-breaks day. of course. on a morning when my entire operating system feels like it's been replaced by a rube goldberg machine, which i just almost called a lou gehrig's machine.

did i say morning? it's 12:48 p.m.

onward and upward. anyway. intense chapter!


DAY 26: PAGES 376-390
how does a book with no plot conclude? not sure. seems like a lot of death but that's also par for the course for the most part.


DAY 27: PAGES 391-405
goddamn this is one cursed family.


DAY 28: PAGES 406-420
seems pretty late to be introducing new major characters but what do i know! this book plays by its own rules.


DAY 29: PAGES 421-435
the penultimate day! and we've reached the Sweeping Statements About Love And Decline And Meaning section. i'll miss reading this book but i'm so excited to see how it concludes.


DAY 30: PAGES 436-448
whoa.


OVERALL
this book is wild, lovely, and weird, conveying in a completely unique way themes about family and time and suffering and love. i can't decide whether reading it in arbitrary doses over a month is the best or worst way to do so, but i had a good time!

i will admit, this is the first time i have read a middle grade novel since i was that age, but i have to hand it to rick riordan. this story is sooo unique, which is hard to do considering how many fantasy novels are out there for young readers. and i have no doubt that, if i had first read when i was a kid, i would have been beyond OBSESSED with it. it makes me so sad to think that my childhood missed out on this series. 

but reading this as an adult is an entirely different experience. i can appreciate this for what it is, which is fun and exciting, but it honestly just made me feel old as it has a very juvenile feel to it. i have heard some of riordans other books are aimed towards older readers, so i may give them a shot since i do love me some greek mythology!

‚Ü† 3.5 stars"
1347,Salome G,The Help,"Jul 10, 2010",1,"The story itself: This could have really used a better editor. I didn't understand why the boyfriend character was even in there--he added nothing to the story. In addition, Skeeter keeps telling us that Hilly and Elizabeth are her friends but that's just it--she tells us. We never see why she would want to be friends with either of them, Hilly especially. Other characters were equally unbelievable. All the maids are good people and so gracious to Miss Skeeter, save one. Reading their interactions with Skeeter, I was reminded of Chris Rock's bit about old black men: ""I know some of you white people know an old black man--'Oh, Willy at the job--he's so nice!' Willy hates your guts."" Worst of all is the particular characterization of Aibileen. I was going to say that it borders on portraying her as a Magical Black Person because I didn't think she had magical powers, but then I remembered the part about how her fellow church members think her prayers are more powerful than others'. 

The premise: Before reading, my question was, can Kathryn Stockett write this story? I read the whole book. I read the self-conscious afterword. Can Stockett write this story? Well, of course she can. But should she? I lean toward no. This is not her story to tell. I was reminded of Lo's Diary and how Pia Pera said that she thought of a part in Lolita as an invitation to a a literary tennis match and so she had to write it and no, you didn't. And neither did Kathryn Stockett. She said that she wrote this book because it'd never occurred to her what her maid Demetrie's life was like. So she made up the story. And it was still all about the white lady."
1348,Andrew,Lord of the Flies,"Aug 22, 2007",4,"I was tempted to give this five stars, since in so many ways it strikes me as the kind of masterpiece, like Heart of Darkness, that I imagine will retain its horror and readability for centuries. The prose veers (or as Golding would say it, ""tends"") from plain to painterly. The story is well known: a sort of allegorical morality play set in modern times -- fancy English boys left to their own devices don't so much as revert to darkness as discover primitive outlets for the darkness reflected in their greater society. This is what I love about Heart of Darkness: try as one might, Kurtz cannot be pigeonholed into good or evil. He is excellent at what he does, and what he does is evil. Kurtz is a true reflection of what excellence was to Colonial Europe, and in so far as Colonial Europe was good, cultivated, honorable, and esteemed, so is Kurtz. Kurtz isn't good or evil; he is true. 

Golding's version is darker. It centers mostly around the corrupting power of urges to overwhelm social order. Freudian criticism abounds, but the parallel I kept coming back to was Rome. I found that Piggy, no matter how truly annoying he is (another brilliant stroke by Golding is to make Piggy strangely unsympathetic), recalled those numerous Republicans of the Early Empire who advocated in a shrill but useless manner for a return to Senate rule but were shunted aside and usually killed by deranged sociopaths who behaved quite like like Jack. But be it Freudian or historic, any framing of this book feels cheap and hollow because the story has such a complexity of primal urges that it feels almost biological. 

Golding said he came up with the idea of book after reading his children ""Treasure Island or Coral Island or some such Island"" in the years of the hydrogen bomb and Stalin and asked his wife, ""why don't I write a children's story about how people really are, about how people actually behave?"" To me that's a chilling question and it reveals an architecture not based on rigid Freudian or historical or symbolic parallels. Its portrait of sadism could have been lifted out of the newspapers; its struggle for dominion over the weak is an almost sexual frenzy recalls everything I know about torture in the dungeons of Argentine or US military prisons. In this respect, I think the book, like Heart of Darkness, is timeless. 

But I chose not to give it five stars because at the center of Golding's book is a kind of rigid Christian iconography, like that you find in the Poisonwood Bible, that offends me, perhaps because it reminds me of the way I wrote my Freshman year of college, or perhaps because that rigidity, that allegiance to a=b symbolic logic insults my intelligence. The martyrdom of Simon, I felt, demeaned the human quality of Simon. I liked him best because he struck me as the most shrewd and practical. Reducing him to an icon transforms him into a variable: Simon = Paul or Peter or whomever, but ergo facto Simon ‚â† Simon. When he comes down to the beach mutting ""something about a body on a hill"" Simon ceases to be a reflection of human complexity, or biological completeness, and instead becomes a rehashed precedent from Sunday school. 

I've often felt that Heart of Darkness' genius was that it somehow reflected the effect of Darwin and modern thinking on the antiquated ideas of Colonial Europe, ie Kurtz isn't good or evil because good and evil are artifices that wilt beneath analysis. When Golding adheres to this materialist perspective, the book is masterly. When he swears allegiance to worn out Christian parables, that complexity is reduced to slips of paper."
1349,Tharindu Dissanayake,Pride and Prejudice,"Jun 18, 2020",5,"""I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.""


Some of my happiest, and most looked-forward-to days of the year are the ones that I reserve for the re-reading of Pride and Prejudice. To quote Austen herself from Sense and Sensibility: ‚Äòif a book is well written, I always find it too short,‚Äô explains perfectly how I feel about this book; no wonder she called this ‚Äòmy own darling child,‚Äô for, for me, P&P is perfect in every conceivable way. It‚Äôs the kind of book, the moment you finished reading, you are tempted to start over again immediately. However, reviewing this is another matter‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm excited, enraptured, but at the same time agitated, knowing that it‚Äôs impossible to do justice to the author nor to the book.


""But such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.""


During my first reading of Pride and Prejudice, I had known I was hugely underqualified to review this book, though at the same time I had hoped, if I read all of her books, I might, in time, write an acceptable review for this masterpiece. Now that I‚Äôve read them all, and also P&P for a second time, all I can say is I still don‚Äôt consider myself remotely qualified to write an objective review. But it is impossible not share one‚Äôs opinions after reading this: this book, for me, is as best as it could get. So, for the time being, I‚Äôll have to be content with writing what I consider to be a subjective overview, which, I‚Äôm certain, does not do much justice. However, I hope that someday my sense in classical literature would become good enough to truly appreciate how remarkable this book is.


""You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity.""


""Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.""


""What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?""


Starting with the plot, which has been thoroughly analyzed, criticized, and commented upon by thousands of readers, is surprisingly, at a glance, not that original, especially if you see this as a pure romance novel. True, there are many complications resulting from multiple relationships (or marriages), but overall, there are many similarities. But what makes this special is Austen‚Äôs narrative: the sly humor, witty observations, unique lens through which she views the society, and the deeper understanding of morals of characters, are all perfectly concocted using her flawless writing style. And then there‚Äôs Elizabeth; aside from inheriting traits like humor and wit from Austen, she is lively, curious, confident, but without becoming ‚Äòtoo perfect‚Äô (like some of the Austen‚Äôs other protagonists). She is as delightful as it could get. Rest of the characters are also similarly entertaining, with each one infused with a myriad of qualities to keep the story interesting. I don‚Äôt think there was a single poorly written character in this book, and that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever said that about a book. And I don‚Äôt wish a single thing had turned out differently in this story. With the exception of some of the children‚Äôs books, that‚Äôs also a first for me. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to imagine, that this has been written over 200 years ago, or this ever becoming dated. Unlike with most romance novels, you will not see the reasoning, or common sense become lost in the middle of the story, which I think will help maintain that timelessness.


""Affectation of candour is common enough ‚Äî one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design ‚Äî to take the good of everybody‚Äôs character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad‚Äîbelongs to you alone.""


This second reading of the book only strengthened above opinions from my first read. If anything, everything felt even clearer, making the reading experience further satisfying. The only minor exception came with Lydia‚Äôs plotline. Compared to my opinion from the first reading, where I had been a bit angry with her, that emotion has been somewhat shifted a little towards sympathy this time. Obviously, same couldn‚Äôt be said about Wickham though. I also felt like that every single word here is essential during this second read. Although I didn‚Äôt skip a single word during the first time, I believe I enjoyed each sentence a lot more this time.


""Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""


Until now (that is till I finish my second read), I‚Äôve never watched any of the TV or movie adaptations of Pride and Prejudice. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt want to have any negative impact towards the perfect imaginary picture Austen had created. But after this second read, I decided to watch the 2005 movie, the 1995 TV series and the 1980 series, and couldn‚Äôt resist sharing some of my thoughts. As much as I appreciate the effort, the 2005 movie did not prove to be a worthy portrayal, at least for me. Maybe it‚Äôs the modern characters, or what had to be removed due to time restrictions, or deviations from original book, but at the end of the day, I cannot say I loved it that much. But the 1995 series was quite the surprise! It literally had almost every single dialog from the book, with a few exceptions at the end. It did add up to five and a half hours of play time, but that was totally worth it. If you loved the book, and haven‚Äôt watched the series, do watch it immediately. As for the 1980 series, though I loved it a lot, it fell a tiny bit behind the 1995 series. But both those series are commendable portrayals.

As for this review, I‚Äôm going to label this as a work in progress, which I‚Äôm hoping to update after each re-read.

1351,Dem,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Aug 19, 2019",3,"I had seen Memoirs of a Geisha described many times as the ‚ÄúPerfect Novel‚Äù and one of the 100 books you should read before you die, so perhaps my expectations were a little height for this one as I was expecting an emotional read and a novel that would transport me in time and enlighten me to mystery of the Japanese culture of the time but sadly this story while good and well written was too slow moving and an unemotional read  for me 

I had been wanting to read this novel for years and they say  ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs for you won‚Äôt pass you by‚Äù  so when I found this one in a used book shop I felt it was time to finally take this one home. It has been loved by so many of my friends over the years and I really was intrigued by the the lives of Geisha. 

TBH I actually thought this was a true story and only realised about 30% into the book that it was a fictional account. The novel tells the story of a fictional geisha working in Kyoto, Japan before, during and after World War II. I loved the first first 100 pages of this novel, the story starts out strong and the characters and culture is intriguing. I enjoyed the slow pace (to start with) but then the book just seemed to drag and become dreadfully descriptive and I found myself page counting and wishing the the novel was 100 pages shorter. 
I enjoyed the characters to begin with and yet by the end I was very glad to part company with them.

The book does offer a fascinating glimpse into the hidden world of the Geisha and this was an aspect of the novel that I really enjoyed and the reason I rated this one 3 stars (which means I liked it but didn't love it) but I am afraid this copy will make its way back to the used book shop and hopefully another reader will enjoy the experience more than me."
1352,Debbie,Charlotte's Web,"Jun 08, 2019",4,"This is some book!

This well-known classic kids‚Äô book is all it‚Äôs cracked up to be. Charlotte is the nicest, wisest spider you‚Äôll ever meet. Wish I could think of sweet Charlotte the next time I see a creepy crawly spider, but I‚Äôm sure the memory of her will go right out the window and I‚Äôll run for my life, as always! 

Everyone should read this book. Well, probably every one has. But true confession here: When my teacher read the book to our class over a few weeks, my 8-year-old self daydreamed off every time! Yep, that‚Äôs me: the attention span of a shoo-fly! How did I do this, I want to know, since now, reading it more than 60 years later, I was completely captivated.

I guess I wanted to give back what I didn‚Äôt allow myself to receive way back when: an amazing, heart-wrenching read! So I read the book to Eliska, the 10-year-old I kid-sit for. She had liked the movie so was up for a read-aloud. I did NOT appreciate it when, half-way into the story, she proudly blurted out the sad ending. The stinker‚Äîshe knew what she was doing and she just wanted to see my expression‚Äîwhich, of course, was pure shock and dismay. She thought she was hilarious; I wish she had gotten the memo on spoilers.

There‚Äôs so much good about this story about two friends: a spider, Charlotte, and a pig, Wilbur. Talking animals, quite a trip. There are stuttering geese; a wise-guy rat. The best part was Charlotte writing in her web, in the hope that she could save Wilbur. I loved the words she chose and how she acquired them. Tickled me to death‚Äîso ingenious! A good lesson in the power of words, the power of language. The first thing Charlotte wrote in the web was SOME PIG.

WARNING: The rest of this so-called review is just a true story about the drama (seriously, not important drama) that occurred while I read this book. Proceed if you want, but I won‚Äôt be insulted if you ignore it. 

While I read, Eliska always does some craft. Once she made rubber-band earrings that could have mutilated my ears, but luckily she warned me, and I removed them the second I left the premises. This time, she decided to give me a tattoo. Oh, she did ask first, as she dangled the tattoo pens in my face. When I hestitated, she assured me that the tattoo would wash right off. I nodded okay, and she went to town on my wrist. I figured the tattoo would be the size of a dime, but as I read about the fate of Charlotte and Wilbur, I saw out of the corner of my eye that it was a multi-colored flower the size of a post-it note. Hm‚Äîthat thing is BIG! I agained ask if she was sure it would come off. This time her story changed a little. ‚ÄúOh, in a couple of days, for sure,‚Äù she says. What??? It hits me that she has no idea whether it will come off! What have I let her do? Am I nuts? I subdued my freakout and kept my head inside Charlotte‚Äôs Web. How my reading voice stayed calm I do not know. 

Eliska was done, and I have to say the tattoo was pretty. Next, she started going crazy painting her fingers with mulit-colored stripes. At first I thought they looked cool, but then I started seeing them through a mom‚Äôs (her mom‚Äôs) eyes and I realized they were pretty ugly‚Äîloud and bright brass knuckles, except they didn‚Äôt cover just the knuckles. Every square inch of her fingers was soaked in marker pen. It suddenly occurred to me that maybe mom would not appreciate the fact that I let her kid write all over her hands. Maybe I was in deep doo-doo. I started getting antsy and I asked Eliska, ‚ÄúAre you SURE these wash off?‚Äù She promptly went and washed off one finger and returned. Huge blue spots like bruises were what remained. It looked like she had USED the brass knuckles, for crying out loud. She giggled nervously as I gasped. ‚ÄúWell, if you scrub it with one of those hard brushes that you wash dirty nails with, more will come off,‚Äù she said. Like this would reassure me. We all know those brushes are nasty! Scrubbing my old wrist might scrub off the skin for all I know. We‚Äôre talking pain. And where to find such a brush in the first place? I don‚Äôt have one lying around. 

Freakout time! At this point I was more worried about Eliska‚Äôs painted fingers than my tattoo. What if her mom was furious? What kind of babysitter lets a kid drench her skin with ink? Maybe Eliska liked this new look so much that she‚Äôll become a badass when she‚Äôs 18 and cover her body in tattoos. Her mom will blame me for sure‚Äîthe babysitter with no sense, the babysitter who was too busy reading Charlotte‚Äôs Web to notice the kid ruining her soft, clear skin with ugly ink. 

Aha moment: maybe I should have had Eliksa draw graffiti on me that said, SOME BABYSITTER. Maybe instead of her mom being mad at me for letting Eliska loose with tattoo pens, she‚Äôd be impressed. Just like the world was impressed that Charlotte had written SOME PIG and it had saved Wilbur‚Äôs life.

Yep, maybe a SOME BABYSITTER tattoo would save my job. I threw the idea out to Eliska, who was in the middle of deciding whether her next finger should have three or four stripes. She thought I was nuts‚Äîwhat was wrong with the beautiful flower she painted? Writing words wouldn‚Äôt be any fun! And come to think of it, it depends on how you interpret SOME BABYSITTER anyway. If you emphasize the ‚Äúsome,‚Äù you could mean ‚Äúthat was SOME babysitter, alright. She was a humdinger!‚Äù (i.e., bad). So maybe it was best that I didn‚Äôt steal Charlotte‚Äôs idea after all.

It was the dad who came home and I didn‚Äôt see him notice Eliska‚Äôs hands. You better believe I was glad that it wasn‚Äôt mom who walked in that door. But I never heard a word about it. No news is good news. Eliska must have had an easier time removing the ink than I had thought. 

What about my tattoo? When I got home, I looked at it a lot but I didn‚Äôt try to remove it right away. I was afraid that if I did, I‚Äôd have a blue blob, like Eliska‚Äôs painted finger. I was trying to ignore it so that I‚Äôd chill. It didn‚Äôt help when my husband glanced at my arm and said, ‚ÄúWhat? You got a TATTOO?‚Äù No way I could pretend it never happened. I told him the story, adding, ‚ÄúIt will wash right off,‚Äù though I didn‚Äôt for a second believe it. He was so excited, he took pictures and sent it out to our daughters, ‚ÄúLook, mom got a tattoo!‚Äù It horrified me that it looked that real. If the tattoo looks so real, does that mean it‚Äôs permanent? I kept telling myself that there was no way that Eliska‚Äôs mom would allow her to have permanent markers in the house, no way. 

I fretted‚Äîshould I wait a few days before I tried to wash it off? No, that would be torture. I needed to know now. So after a few hours, I tried. And damn if the tattoo, the beautiful tattoo, didn‚Äôt disappear‚Äîcompletely. No scrubbing necessary, and no blue blob in sight. 

You know, I‚Äôll always think of the tattoo whenever I think about Charlotte‚Äôs Web. That was some book. Wilbur was some pig. I was some babysitter."
1353,Roohdaar,The Catcher in the Rye,"Oct 01, 2010",1,"Well, this was a pain to get through.

First of all, this is a shitty way to start a novel no matter how you want to introduce your main character.

If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. 


That is easily one of the saddest, most pathetic introductions to a book. As I started this book, I wondered... if the introduction is like this, how will the rest of the book be?

This is what the rest of the book looked like:

""He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I'll tell you what kind of red hair he had."" 

""I sort of used to go to Allie's baseball matches.""

""It was around ten-thirty, I guess, when I finished it."" 

I can imagine Holden as this very insipid, boring little kid with no life in him whatsoever. 

Also, Holden thinks everyone besides him is a phony and a moron. And he makes it very clear because he mentions it, like, every two pages. Literally... every damn time. 

I read some of the comments regarding how I didn't understand this book because I didn't relate to it. That may be true. Very, very true. Regardless, I still think to this day that this book is a drag and has an unlikable main character and a dry, boring writing style. Perhaps I will read it again when I am older and maybe I'll enjoy it."
1354,Cecily,The Help,"Jul 18, 2011",3,"This is a powerful story about women's relationships with each other, and how they are affected by race (and class), told from the viewpoints of three women (two black maids and a young white woman). It is set in segregated Jackson, Mississippi, in 1962-64, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, but it's local and domestic, rather than looking at the big picture.

The first third of the book establishes the main characters and their situation and relationships; the rest of it revolves around a dangerous plan to write about their lives: it ends up reading as if it's a book about how this book was created (though the notes at the end make it clear that it isn't). 

It is a novel about individuals, and makes no pretence of being a history of the civil rights movement, but given the subject matter, it arouses strong feelings (see below, including comments, for some of the reasons). Passions run high in those with direct experience or detailed knowledge of racial issues in the US. My comments are the reaction of a fairly ignorant outsider.

For a deeper, more complex, and educational (for me) way of looking at the legacy of slavery on race relations, see Octavia Butler's Kindred, review here.

IT'S ABOUT MOTHERING AND AWAKENING AS MUCH AS RACE

Although it might appear that the main relationships are between employer and help, mothering and displaced mothering is in many ways a stronger theme. It's also about other relationships, especially between women: bitchy cliques, friendships made and broken, fear versus collusion. Husbands don't generally come out of it well.

There is an awkward pact involved for white mothers: letting your children be raised by members of a race you despise versus raising the children of your oppressors. As Skeeter says, ""They raise a white child and then 20 years later the child becomes the employer. It's that irony that we love them and they love us, yet we don't even allow them to use the toilet in the house"". There are opportunities to sway young minds (and Aibileen tries especially hard), whilst thinking, ""Baby Girl, who I know, deep down, I can't keep from turning out like her mama"". 

The maids' jobs and colour also have a negative effect on their own mothering. Not only do some of the white children feel the help loves them more than their own mothers; in some cases they are right, and that causes other tensions and problems. Yet firing the help is not always an option: ""the help always know"" all the secrets.

The three main characters are very strong women, and each gradually finds the strength to follow her conscience, despite the personal risks, to the point where Skeeter realises ""I no longer feel protected because I am white"". They learn, grow, awaken, and take some control over the future. 

However, if I were an African-American, or raised in the deep south, I'm sure these aspects would seem much less significant in comparison to the race theme.

AUTHENTICITY?

When I read this, I had no idea how accurate any of it is (I have subsequently learned of many doubts), but in terms of individual relationships, it rings true to this Brit, especially the different voices through which the story is told. 

It was also interesting that the maids were so used to ""the lines"", that they disliked it when they were crossed, e.g. by an employer who was too friendly: ""She just don't see 'em. The Lines. Not between her and me, not between her and Hilly"". Yet the maids train their own children into subjugation by teaching the rules ""for working for a white lady"". This has strange effects: ""I don't know what to say to her. All I know is, I ain't saying it. And I know she ain't saying what she want a say either and it's a strange thing happening here cause nobody saying nothing and we still managing to have us a conversation"".

On the other hand, it seems improbable that all the powerful white women in the town are only in their mid 20s. I presume that was necessary because they needed to be contemporaries of Skeeter, and she needed to be young, but it still made me question the story in broader terms.

SYMPATHIES

One expects to have strong sympathies for the maids, but a couple of the white women (including Skeeter) have a hard time (not as hard as the maids, though): material privilege, but they don't fit into either world. That creates a tension in the reader that is quite powerful.

The saddest white person is the little girl Aibileen cares for; she is a misfit in her own home, because her mother never bonded with her, ""She like one a them baby chickens that get confused and follow the ducks around instead"". Aibileen tries hard to compensate, particularly by repeating the mantra ""You kind, you smart, you important"". Mind you, she also sows the seeds future disagreement with her parents by telling secret stories about a kind alien visitor called Martian Luther King who thinks all people are the same, and by wrapping identical sweets in different coloured wrappers to make the same point. ""I want to stop that moment from coming - and it comes in ever white child's life - when they start to think that coloured folks ain't as good as whites.""

STEREOTYPES

Although the book fits with some stereotypes (e.g. the hideous contradiction of raising money for starving Africans whilst campaigning for outside loos in all white homes, lest the owners catch black diseases), it certainly confounds others, both in the minds of some of the characters and, to a lesser extent, to the readers (e.g. many of the maids are more educated than might be expected and Aibileen is an keen and excellent writer). 

As Skeeter says, ""The dichotomy of love and disdain living side by side is what surprises me"", and that was the core of the book for me.

LANGUAGE, DIALECT and DIFFERENT VOICES

From the very first sentence, you are aware of Aibileen's voice and dialect, ""on a early Sunday"". She is an ageing maid who cares for white children when they are young, then moves on. Her own son died in an industrial accident at 24 and from then ""A bitter seed was planted inside me. And I just didn't feel so accepting any more"". 

Is this dialect accurate, patronising appropriation, or both?

Minny is the other black voice: a maid and church friend of Aibileen's, but with a young family and violent husband. She speaks her mind, so has often been fired.

The final voice is Skeeter, the daughter of a plantation owner who has returned from college and is shocked to discover that the beloved maid who raised her has gone, and no one will tell her why.

OTHER IRRITATIONS

* My knowledge of US history is scanty and I didn't know when it was set until page 22, though even then I was only able to work it out by looking up Stevie Wonder's year of birth.

* Despite being initially vague about the date, some subsequent mentions of period detail seem rather forced, e.g. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", Rosa Parks and Bob Dylan. It should have been possible to mention them in a more natural way.

* Did anyone say they needed ""space"" and ""time"" away from a relationship in Mississippi in 1963?"

1356,Lyn,Animal Farm,"Aug 02, 2011",5,"Not as formidable as 1984, this modern day fable, though, bears down hard on totalitarianism and even more on the very aspects of our nature that brings power struggles about.

First published in 1945, this allegorical criticism of Stalinist communism is nonetheless still relevant today as a cautionary satire on totalitarianism in general.

*** 2023 reread - 

I need to make this an annual reread, like it‚Äôs younger brother 1984.

Interestingly, this book is frequently selectively quoted and considered. Orwell was against totalitarianism, specifically Stalinism, not socialism. He was for most of his life a devoted democratic socialist, but a vocal opponent of authoritarianism. 

This nuanced distinction is often lost. Even in his portrayal of the evolution of the farm - from Manor Farm to Animal Farm, and beyond - he identifies many successes of collectivism and how it gives greater autonomy and purpose to the animals. He is critical of the biased communications and propaganda from totalitarian regimes and this can be seen as a cautionary tale regarding these kinds of governments.

I also thought of Ursula K. LeGuin‚Äôs brilliant novel The Dispossessed. While both LeGuin‚Äôs non-authoritarian anarchism and the voluntary socialism Orwell champions may only work on paper, his warnings against impaired freedom of speech and of ideological corruption were spot on.

This is also timeless, many of the lessons he imparts and observations made are as relevant now as in the 40s."
1357,Ilse,Jane Eyre,"Mar 05, 2020",5,"The kind of novel that makes one believe in love (again) - or at least desire to hold on to the illusion.

1358,Jim,The Da Vinci Code ,"Jul 17, 2007",1,"This is a pretty formulaic page turner, a fun quick read. Written at about the level of the average Nancy Drew mystery, it is best appreciated at that level. As far as the content, there are howlers on virtually every page (starting with the hero who looks like ""Harrison Ford in Harris tweed"" and is a ""Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard"" -- good work if you can find it). You have to ignore very pulpy, cheesy writing to enjoy this romantic thriller.

Intended as a book that a dedicated reader could finish in a day, or something you take to the beach and casually finish in a weekend, The Da Vinci Code makes for a reasonable airline novel, so much so that it is often a bit clunky in its desire to ensure that no intellectual effort on the reader's part will be required. Here's a recurring example in this novel: a bit of unfamiliar terminology, say ""crux gemmata"" (jeweled cross) will will be explained on page N, then on page N+1, a character will finger his jeweled cross and explain, ""Oh, yes -- this is a crux gemmata."" I've read dinner menus that were more demanding on the reader. My wife and I both read about a third of it in a day, sharing the same copy, and that's a full work day plus taking care of kids, bedtime, etc. That's also a kind of virtue, I guess -- it's fast and peppy.

As far as history goes, Dan Brown apparently thinks that ""most historians"" give credence to the hoary forgeries and frauds promoted in sensationalist best-sellers like Holy Blood, Holy Grail. This author gets the best of both worlds: simultaneously claiming that ""it's just fiction,"" while introducing the novel with claims that the historical record contained within is ""fact."" That claim is ridiculous. To pluck a random example, he spends some time talking about the Council of Nicaea, and incorrectly summarizes it as the origin of the doctrine of Christ's divinity by Constantine. He ignores the Arian controversy out of which it arose, which is like trying to explain the Treaty of Versailles without mentioning World War I. He ignores the documented fact, agreed upon even by the cheerleaders of the gnostics that he is sympathetic to, that the earliest gnostic doctrines held that Christ was *purely* God, and not really man -- the very reverse of the doctrine that serves as the linchpin of his novel's intellectual base (such as it is). This is a bad novel for weak or misinformed Christians, but anyone familiar with history should spot the train wreck of Brown's ideas a mile off.

Oh yes, and in Brown's world, Opus Dei has shadowy assassin ""monks"" (in real life, Opus Dei is not a monastic order -- there are no Opus Dei monks, let alone trained assassins), and the Catholic Church has been promulgating known lies as its central dogmas, promotes violence throughout the world, and has been retarding the progress of science and knowledge for 2 millennia. Brown leaves the reader with the impression that this, too, is a matter of settled historical record. Oh, but then again, it's just fiction. Except when it's not.

In general, if you're looking for a heady thriller wrapped around Christian arcana, I'd recommend Umberto Eco's excellent The Name of the Rose, not this dumbed down, by-the-numbers novel."

""I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk to you,"" said the Quiz Addict. ""I am very busy. Wait. In Twilight, what color was Edward's car?""

""I don't know,"" said the Little Prince. ""I have never read this book Twilight.""

""I think it was blue,"" said the man. ""Damn! I was wrong. Silver. In Twilight, who joined the Cullen family first?""

""I told you,"" said the Little Prince, ""that I haven't read this book. But it must be an interesting book if you answer questions about it all day long. I would very much like to read it.""

""It is the stupidest book ever written!"" said the man.

""Then why do you answer questions about it all day long?"" asked the Little Prince.

""Because if I don't,"" sighed the man, ""then my friend on asteroid B451 will get ahead of me. ""He has read the whole series. Luckily, he hasn't read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.""

""When you have finished the Quiz,"" asked the Little Prince, ""I hope you will be able to read some of these books you have around you? I notice that you have had Atonement on your to-read list for the last six months.""

""It is a Never-Ending Quiz,"" answered the man. ""In Twilight, what color was Edward's car?""

""I believe you said silver?"" answered the Little Prince politely.

""Thank you,"" muttered the man. ""Yes! You were right. I should have known that.""

""I'm sorry, I must be going,"" said the Little Prince. And he went on his way, thinking that grown-ups were very, very, very strange."
1360,Lu√≠s,1984,"Nov 03, 2020",4,"I wanted to understand the origin of the expression ""Big Brother"" associated with our modern world, and I immersed myself in 1984 by George Orwell. This novel of anticipation, published in 1949, is striking! We follow the destinies of Winston and Julia in this universe, which is reminiscent of ours or what it could become. Of course, it is a fable, but the images strike and remain used for a long time. After reading this cult novel, we look at certain realities differently. It is a detour that is worth it, a must. Why did I wait so long to read it?"

‚ÄîJohn Steinbeck

Five mind-blown stars!

When I started Of Mice and Men, I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd chosen the right read. The dialogue really was not what I expected and Steinbeck‚Äôs straightforward prose cut straight to the core of the matter. However, I stuck with it and the reward blew my mind!

Set in 1930s California, the story follows two destitute men as they roam, taking work where it could be found. George and Lennie had grown up together, and when Lennie‚Äôs Aunt and caretaker died, George bore the responsibility of watching over him, a man fully grown and built like a bear, but with the innocent mind of a child. Lennie, due to his ineptness, unintentionally creates situations that lead to trouble, and it was up to George to keep them both from being lynched on many occasions. George, though often frustrated with Lennie, dearly loved his friend. All they had was each other and a fanciful dream of owning their own farm. Life on the road can be desperately lonely, and to have such a good companion was a precious commodity. I was filled with respect for George who did everything in his power to take care of his dear friend.

 This is not an easy read by any stretch of the imagination. While it is graced with beautiful friendships and the milk of human kindness, the book also explores the darkest aspects of humanity, and the ugly racism in the book is really hard to stomach. Steinbeck writes with a raw realism that is admirable, but his honest depiction brings the cruelty that we all know exists in the world. 

The story came together with such a crescendo that my heart nearly burst from my chest. I won‚Äôt spoil this for anyone who hasn‚Äôt read it, but the tale touched me so profoundly that I was left staring at the last page for ages before I could bring myself to close it."
1363,Peter,The Help,"Dec 29, 2016",5,"Servility 
This is a book that delivers on several levels: it is an entertaining and engrossing novel with drama, humour and sadness, but it also causes us to reflect on deeply moral and racial issues. While racism has existed for a long time and continues to unfold, the story provides a snap-shot into a time that is fascinating and how historically it manifested itself into society in the US. It‚Äôs a story of how servants or maids show more integrity and moral compass than their employers. It‚Äôs a story of life and communities: how we love and hate, how we laugh and cry, how we interact with family, friends and those we work with/for.

The narrative in The Help places the perspective from a white journalist, Miss Skeeter, and two black maids, Aibileen and Minny. Miss Skeeter wants to write a book using the insights both Aibileen and Minny as to what it's like to be a maid and how they are treated. This causes major concerns of trust, if they are to be open and truthful, as Minny says.
‚ÄúI can't believe Aibileen wants to tell Miss Skeeter the truth.
Truth.
It feels cool, like water washing over my sticky-hot body. Cooling a heat that's been burning me up all my life.
Truth, I say inside my head again, just for that feeling.‚Äù
 
Each character is very well developed with more than just a superficial front and they show depth to the many aspects of their lives. There are other books that cover slavery, segregation and racism in the US, many are more sensational and brutal in their coverage of black subjugation, however, this book leads us to those issues in a less graphic manner for a more mainstream international audience. The stories and insights in themselves are inspiring and understanding the paradox where someone like Aibileen can be trusted to raise white children but watched suspiciously in case she steals material items, is bizarre. How maids must remain upbeat and pleasant regardless of the way they‚Äôre treated or what may be happening within their own families and personal lives. To hold the quality of someone‚Äôs life as a weapon is corrupt and repulsive, but to do it on a systemic scale is completely abhorrent.

The Help is a very clever book, perhaps meant for more global audiences as it provides an entertaining story whilst delivering these deep ethical issues. I highly recommend this book."
1364,Benjermin,The Giving Tree,"Nov 26, 2007",5,"Yes, the boy is a selfish bastard, who doesn't deserve the love and generosity he gets time and again. Anyone who read this book as a child is well aware of this fact.

Nonetheless, I'm shocked to see how many disliked it. My only thought is that many readers allow their hatred for the boy to be confused with hatred for the book. Does the book condone the boy's behavior, or simply seek to tell a narrative? Does the quality of a book suffer when the moral quality of its characters flags?

It is the job of narrative to relate a story. It is the job of a classic to relate a timeless story, to which countless readers of any age can relate. So whence the hatred? Is it because so many readers have known people who have taken and taken with such unrelenting fervor that they then displace this hatred onto a book that merely tells a story so fundamental it can't help but arouse feelings in any human who reads it?

Silverstein, in my opinion, reached his peak with this book, so simple, and so pure, and more timeless than any book I can think of (at the moment)."
1365,Kat Kennedy,The Chronicles of Narnia ,"Feb 14, 2010",5,"I discovered The Chronicles of Narnia when I was six years old halfway through my first year of school. I had discovered the joys of our school library and I still remember the day and the exact shelf where I found The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. It was the lowest shelf, the one that rested on the ground and I had to crouch down to wiggle the book out from amongst its peers. By the time I'd finished first grade I'd read them all and searched high and low for any book series that could be as wonderful and magical as this one had been.

Now I could dismiss my love of these books as some quaint, childhood memory that I was unwilling to let go of. Certainly that is a factor. However, the magic has never faded. I've read them all so many times that I've memorized them. I've memorized them so thoroughly that I've told them as bed time stories to children that I've done baby sitting for. Children who have loved the stories and begged to go to bed early so that they could hear MORE about Diggory and Polly or Lucy, Peter, Edmund and Susan or more about Shasta and Avaris and so on and so forth.

It's not just children, either. My husband and I read a book, a proper book for half an hour for our son every night. For the past month that has been The Chronicles of Narnia. It's gotten to the point where he doesn't want to stop. Our son's bedtime comes and goes and my husband insists on reading just a little bit more. He says things like, ""I wish I'd read these as a child! They're fantastic!""

Are they perfect? No. The Last Battle is a hard and frustrating read. The Magician's Nephew is a little awkward. The Horse and His Boy is just a TAD controversial for some of its content. But they're so, so worth the read. 

To me, there's a magic to these books that time and life has never managed to dim."
1366,Cecily,Lord of the Flies,"Feb 23, 2009",3,"A hard book to rate as although its well written and is very thought provoking, the content gets unpleasantly graphic and some aspects are awkwardly dated (eg the assumption the British boys should be jolly good chaps - ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not savages, we‚Äôre English‚Äù).

Plot

It starts off as a conventional adventure: a mixed group of boys (some know each other; many who don‚Äôt) survive a plane crash on a desert island and struggle to survive. It is somewhat confused and confusing at first ‚Äì perhaps to make the reader empathise with the boys‚Äô confusion.

From the outset there are issues of priorities (Jack‚Äôs instant gratification of hunting or Ralph‚Äôs long term need for shelter and maintaining a fire signal) and leadership. It‚Äôs inevitable that standards of ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù will slip. 

There is also an infectious fear of ‚Äúthe beast‚Äù, although whether one interprets it as animal, airman, hallucination, or symbolic may vary at different points in the story. Certainly the tone of the book changes after Simon‚Äôs first encounter with Lord of the Flies.

Group Dynamics

Eventually the boys split into two groups: hunters who become ever more ‚Äúsavage‚Äù in appearance and behaviour, and the remainder who want to retain order, safety, common sense ‚Äì and their lives. Why do the obedient and angelic choir turn to savagery - does the fact they have an identified leader, who isn't the overall leader once they're on the island, contribute? One also wonders how the story might be different if it was a mixed sex group, or even an all girl group. Very different, certainly, and I suppose it would provide a distraction to what Golding was trying to say about human (or just male?) nature.

It illustrates how petty bullying can be condoned and encouraged within groups (exacerbated by rituals, chanting, body markings etc) and how it can escalate to much worse. Nevertheless, one of the main victims, Piggy, is proud of his differences, demonstrates knowledge and intelligence and actually grows in confidence as his leader loses his.

Milgran, Zimbardo, Christianity...

It questions whether it is power or the environment that makes some of the boys so bad (echoes of Zimbardo‚Äôs prison experiments and Milgram‚Äôs obedience experiments - if a book can echo things which came after it was written). 

In fact, Golding ""experimented, while a teacher at a public school, with setting boys against one another in the manner of Lord of the Flies""! See HERE (thanks Matt).

The more Christian concept of original sin runs through it, which was probably Golding's intention (his editor made him make Simon less Jesus-like), along with other Christian analogies relating to snakes, devils (aka Lord of the Flies), self sacrifice, and redemption/rescue. 

And then there are the conch and fire as symbols of order and god, respectively, in total contrast to the warpaint etc of the warriors. 

Lots to think about, but more the stuff of nightmares than dreams.

Compared with The Hunger Games

It's interesting to compare this with The Hunger Games, which modern teens probably find much easier to relate to (see my review HERE). I think one problem Lord of the Flies has is that the period is tricky: too far from the present to seem ""relevant"" (though I think it is), but not long enough ago to be properly historical.

Compared with I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream

For another dysfunctional group trying to survive a very different ordeal, see Harlan Ellison's horrific short story about an evil supercomputer, which I reviewed HERE."

1368,Lisa Kay,Gone with the Wind,"Jan 07, 2011",5,"My mother wouldn't let me read ""Gone With the Wind"" until I was 16. A few years ago I was at a cocktail party and they asked the trivia question ""What was the first line of GWtW?"" I knew the answer. My husband asked, ""How did you know that?"" (He'd lived with me how many decades?) I told him about my mom's restriction and how, when I finally opened the book, I was stunned by the first sentence. I had seen the movie and Scarlett was beautiful, if a bitch. I also remember it because everyone always talked about how hard it was to cast the role for the movie and how beautiful I thought Vivian Leigh was. In the book Scarlett is not so much a ""supreme bitch of the universe"" as a survivor and she drags her family along (kicking and screaming) with her. She is presented slightly different and more complex in the book. The whole incident with Scarlett stealing her sister's beau? In the book you just knew that her sister would only use Hamilton‚Äôs money for herself where Scarlett wanted it to save Tara because Tara means 'dirt/land/earth' in Ireland. If you had land, you were rich and self-sufficient. I wouldn't have minded being on a deserted island with her if I was part of her family...Or even in the middle of a civil war. LOL. (In the movie they also left out a couple of marriages and kids which gave her more depth.)

We all know this war torn families apart. Years ago I had a cousin who traced our family tree. I had a great-great-great-grandfather who lived in the South and went to fight for the North. I also had another who lived in the North and went to fight for the South. No wonder I always want to play ‚Äòdevil‚Äôs advocate.‚Äô It‚Äôs in my DNA.

I could go off on a whole tangent about the characters in GWTW and what each of them represented with regard to the South. If Scarlett represented a segment of the South the way it was when the Civil War started, it was as a progressive segment that knew where it was headed: strong, determined, attractive, young, rich, bored (complacent), spoiled, unable to love those who truly understood her and loved her anyway (i.e. the North not wanting the South to leave, the South not loving the Union), doing anything to get her way or survive (even enslave a people or take advantage of chained-gang prison-workers)‚Ä¶ever so slowly changing, showing bravery, but learning too late how to change in time‚Ä¶Well then, the first sentence takes on a whole new meaning. (view spoiler)[‚ÄùScarlett O‚ÄôHara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were.‚Äù (hide spoiler)] Slavery is not beautiful, it‚Äôs ugly.

But the wealth it provided? Well, as I learned in my economics class in college, if the war had been fought five years later the South would have won. It was that wealthy. It was also this book that told me that the North was not blameless in the whole thing as many of the slave sellers/capturers and slave ship owners were from the North. They never told me THAT in high school. And Scarlett? Like our forfathers chose to do while writing the constitution, she was going to think about all of it (slavery) tomorrow. Scarlett is, in this story, the eyes of the progressive South at that time and she fails to see the world around her in time. Maybe because she‚Äôs too busy batting her lashes to get her way. And yet we feel for her when she pulls that carrot out of the ground, eats it and throws up. We grieve so for her heartbreak at the end of the book. How did Mitchell pull that off? We are right there with her when she‚Äôs lost in the fog and can‚Äôt see before she goes home to Tara.

Rhett is the New South, charming, lustful, innovative, an investor. Cynicism (a trait he shares with Scarlett) hides his compassion (a trait he shares with Melanie), and he won‚Äôt fight or take a side in the war until he must. But Mitchell makes him and all her characters extremely complex, for she gives him a sense of honor for honor‚Äôs sake. (Is he then a gentleman like Ashley?) Rhett‚Äôs almost downfall? His deep and abiding love for Scarlett (he - like Melanie - sees her for who and what she is, the good as well as the bad); nevertheless, he eventually leaves her ideology behind in disgust. He has the work-ethic and is the muscle, but only flexes it when his devastating charm won‚Äôt work. In the end he walks out.

Ashley and Melanie? Two different, complex aspects of the Old South - one lost without the other - and their antiquated way of life. Remember, Ashley doesn‚Äôt love Scarlett and he detests slavery. But he didn‚Äôt know how to survive without it. He‚Äôs painted himself into a corner. Ashley wants to marry Melanie because he believes he has more in common with her than Scarlett. He‚Äôs wrong. He‚Äôs the intellect of the Old South, struggling to hang on to his gentlemanly behavior and failing totally. As Annalisa says in her Goodreads review: ‚Äú(Scarlett) sees Ashley not as the strong, honorable character she had always esteemed but the weakest and least honorable character in the book. Anyone who would tease another woman with confessions of love just so he could keep her heart and devotion at arm's length is not truly honoring his marriage vows.‚Äù There‚Äôs a reason he is in a prison during the war. He doesn‚Äôt want to/can‚Äôt change some aspects of his life/nature, and in the end can‚Äôt conceive of a life without his heart, for that is where courage lives. For all our deep philosophical ideals do not reside in the brain but in our heart.

The heart? That would be Melanie, a gentle southern belle, a ‚Äògreat lady‚Äô and one of the few true ‚Äòpurely good‚Äô people in Mitchell‚Äôs epic. She was sickly due to so many generations of inbreeding within an educated, affluent family. She is the heart and courage of the Old South, not its eyes. She refuses to believe the ‚Äòugliness‚Äô of Scarlett when she witnesses her in Ashley‚Äôs arms (and for once Scarlett is innocent). Melanie is the only one who sees Rhett cry and soon after she dies.

Mammy? She has it all and sees all. The all-knowing mother with eyes in the back of her head. The work-ethic. The conscience. An inner strength, and a loving, forgiving nature.

I told you I was sixteen when I read this. In my naivet√© I asked my mother if Rhett and Scarlett got back together and she told me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a beautiful tea cup. Once it‚Äôs broken, you can glue it back together, but it is never as beautiful to the eyes as it once was.‚Äù Scarlett really represents a ‚Äúmight have been.‚Äù What might have been if slavery had been abolished in 1776? Or even anytime before 1862? Was she truly blind, wearing rose-tinted glasses, or did she let pride and hubris get in her way?

You do remember your history lessons? Don‚Äôt expect a happy ending."

1370,Christopher,The Alchemist,"Aug 13, 2007",2,"I really disliked this book. I dislike it in the way that I dislike a great deal of modern self help books. Their basic message is that if you want something to happen, you need to want it as hard as you can, without caring about anything else, not allowing yourself to doubt it, or let criticisms will get in the way then it will happen.
I disagree with this notion, not only because it is false, but because it is bad.
Just because we desire something, does not make it good. This idea of 'following your heart' is often wrong. Who are we to be the arbiters of truth? Why should our hearts be sources of information that go beyond logic, doubt and reasoning? Haven't we all desired things that have turned out to not be in our best interest, or to be harmful to others? Andrew Jackson was a man known to have a lot of integrity. He was always 'true' to himself and followed his heart. Andrew Jackson is the man who initiated the 'Trail of Tears'. Moving Native Americans from their homes and into reservations. 
Next, this idea of not letting ourselves doubt or consider doubts. This is a terrible and dishonest way to live. If we don't consider doubts, and entertain them often, then we are deliberately blinding ourselves. Deliberately making ourselves ignorant. If someone doesn't give serious consideration to the idea that they may be wrong. Give serious thought to why they believe what they do, and that perhaps those who doubt them may be correct, then they are behaving in a dangerous and dishonest way.
Not giving heed to the concerns doubts and criticisms of others is something I believe is a major fault in modern society. Often, people fail to recognize the needs of the group and the community. We place so much emphasis on the needs and rights of the individual. This causes people to focus so much on themselves to the detriment of others around them. At times, it can be beneficial to go against the group, but one should first give serious consideration to the groups concerns.

According to Ideas like the Alchemist, groups like, the Westboro Baptist Church,(godhatesfags.com) should be seen as American heroes. These are people who take a totally irrational stance, and stick to it as hard as they can in complete defiance to the views of everyone around them."
1371,Maja (The Nocturnal Library),The Book Thief,"Aug 11, 2011",5,"‚ÄúWhen death captures me,‚Äù the boy vowed, ‚Äúhe will feel my fist on his face.‚Äù
Personally, I quite like that. Such stupid gallantry.
Yes.
I like that a lot.

A few days ago, when I was starting The Book Thief, my mother stopped by and saw the book on my coffee table. Having just read it herself (and knowing me better than anyone else in the world, I might add), she was determined to save me from myself. She did her very best to convince me not to read it. She described in detail the three day long headache all the crying had caused her and the heartache she now has to live with, but I‚Äôm nothing if not stubborn. I guess I never learned to listen to my mother. 
I‚Äôm pretty sure her parting sentence was: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come crying to me.‚Äù And I didn‚Äôt. I huddled in a corner and cried inconsolably instead. 

Death himself narrates the story about a little girl named Liesel growing up with her foster parents in Nazi Germany. At the beginning, I felt somewhat intimidated by the idea of Death as a narrator. I assumed that his voice would be dark and thunderous, but for the most part, he was a ray of light illuminating earth‚Äôs saddest time. Incredibly insightful observations and occasional dry humor are only some of the things no one but Death could have brought into this story. Besides, we hear people calling God‚Äôs name every day for many reasons, but when Death calls to Him in despair and even those calls fall on deaf ears, no one can fail to understand the gravity of the situation.

I do not carry a sickle or a scythe.
I only wear a hooded black robe when it‚Äôs cold.
And I don‚Äôt have those skull-like 
facial features you seem to enjoy
pinning on me from a distance. You 
want to know what I truly look like?
I‚Äôll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue.


The Book Thief is not one of those books you read compulsively, desperate to find out what‚Äôs on the next page. No. It is, in fact, better to read it slowly, in small doses, in a way that allows you to savor every word and absorb the power and the magic it contains. All the while, you know what‚Äôs going to happen. Death has no patience for mysteries. However, anticipation of the inevitable makes it even worse. My whole body was tingling with fear because I knew what was coming and I knew that it was only a matter of time.
Zusak found a way to give a fresh approach to a much-told story. He offered a glimpse at the other side of the coin. Really, should we feel sorry for the people hiding in a basement in Munich suburbs? Sure, bombs are falling on their heads, but most of them are members of the Nazi Party, willingly or reluctantly. Some of them truly think that Jews are no better than rats. Some, on the other hand, are hiding a Jew in their own basement. Some are just innocent children. But the more important question is, are we any better at all if we don‚Äôt feel compassion and sorrow? Death does a great job of asking all these questions in a calm, unobtrusive way.

I‚Äôm not pretentious enough to believe that my clumsy words can ever do this book justice. I won‚Äôt even try. Time will speak for it, as I‚Äôm pretty sure it will survive for decades and generations to come. The Book Thief and Markus Zusak should find their place in every school textbook all over the world. 


Seven thousand stars could never be enough for this book. 

EDIT: A few words from the man himself:
https://twitter.com/#!/Markus_Zusak/s...
https://twitter.com/#!/Markus_Zusak/s..."
1372,Lynne King,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Jan 19, 2013",5,"I started this book with high expectations. I had been overwhelmed with every conceivable emotion when I read the ‚ÄúKite Runner‚Äù and just couldn‚Äôt believe that his second book, ‚ÄúA Thousand Splendid Suns‚Äù, could possibly be as good.

So it was with trepidation and yet excitement that I read this book. I had left the last dozen or so pages to read until the following morning, as I didn‚Äôt want to quite let it go, and as I sat there at 7 a.m. on the terrace, with a cup of coffee in my hand, I slowly finished the book. I breathed in deeply on reading the final sentence and looked down the valley, past the foothills at the Pic d‚ÄôAnie, part of the magnificent Pyrenean mountain chain. The sun would be rising over the hills within the hour as I looked in the direction of Afghanistan, wondering how many Moslems had already prayed that morning in the mosques, with their prayer mats facing towards Makkah in Saudi Arabia.

This book was an extraordinary, contemporary, social document covering Afghan history from before the Soviet war until after the Taliban rule. The violence that ensued from this period in time resulted in the inevitable violence towards women. I abhor any form of violence and live in fear what will happen should another war occur. To see in what low-esteem and contempt the average Afghan viewed women, especially the Taliban, quite shocked me, and yet I ‚Äúlived and breathed‚Äù this book. Women were worth nothing.

I think the reason this book had such a profound effect on me was due to living in Saudi Arabia for sixteen years and I could relate to a certain extent to what the women had to endure. Under the Qur‚Äôan, men were entitled to have up to four wives, and they were supposed to treat them all equally. Then a man could just arbitrarily state ‚ÄúI divorce thee‚Äù three times and that was the end of the marriage. Many women were just cast out from the family home and led a miserable existence begging on the streets. What was remarkable about these women, however, was their instinct for survival and they still managed to laugh and joke. 

The author‚Äôs own words were concise and to the point of life in Afghanistan at that time:

‚ÄúFor almost three decades now, the Afghan refugee crisis has been one of the most severe around the globe. War, hunger, anarchy and oppression forced millions of people‚Ä¶‚Ä¶to abandon their homes and flee Afghanistan to settle in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.‚Äù

The book is basically the powerful story of two women, Mariam and Laila, whose lives become indelibly linked because of three men: Jalil, Tariq and Rasheed.

Mariam was the illegitimate daughter of Jalil, living with her mother Nana in an isolated place outside of Herat. She really loves her father and decides that she wishes to live with him instead of her mother, with disastrous consequences; the upshot being that Mariam is forced to become the wife of Rasheed in Kabul.

Laila is a good childhood friend of Tariq and they finally fall in love with far reaching results when Tariq leaves with his family for Pakistan. Laila, who‚Äôs a great survivor, and philosophical, as is Mariam, then becomes Rasheed‚Äôs wife.

For the two women, life with Rasheed becomes a living hell. I kept on thinking, I just want something really evil to happen to this despicable creature (I have worse thoughts than that but best to keep quiet on that and not write them down).

In reality Tariq, the childhood friend of Laila, is the catalyst in the book. I really admired him, he was my favorite character, and he was brilliantly portrayed.

The writing style is simple as far as I‚Äôm concerned and there is an over excess of violence. However, the attention for detail is remarkable and this runs throughout the book: 

When Laila is recovering at Rasheed‚Äôs home after a bomb attack, Mariam sees a complete and utter change in her husband. He becomes unusually kind and gentle, and he is seen to be courting Laila.

The humiliation of both Mariam and Laila at having to wear the burqa, thus putting them into insignificance to the outside world; the husband being the only person allowed to look upon their faces.

The incident when Rasheed ‚Äúmakes love‚Äù to Laila for the first time. She to all intents and purposes is a virgin. She has a knife, cuts her finger and leaves some blood on the bed under where they were sleeping.

Laila cooking a rather bad meal for Rasheed and the end results with the stones.

Laila, Mariam and Rasheed with the shovel. This nearly blew my mind.

Mariam in jail, refusing to see anyone, and then her journey to the football stadium. I had the most incredible feeling of time just stopping at this point and had great difficulty in turning the page. But then this happened to me on innumerable occasions throughout this wonderful book.

I‚Äôm always intrigued with the titles of books and this one was no exception. This originated from a poem written by Saib-e-Tabrizi in the 17th century and is quoted by Laila‚Äôs father Babi when the family had decided to leave Kabul. He could, however, only remember these two lines:

‚ÄúOne could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,
Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.‚Äù

I just absolutely loved this book. However, I‚Äôm not happy having purely the Kindle version and so I‚Äôve ordered the hardback. I still get more pleasure from a book.

""it's so awesome! so titillating! the way the author captures that thing where the girl says that stuff and then they go to that cool place.. you know? even oprah says so!"" 

and then there are the crowds of friends who carry around their freshly bought ""it"" book (ok, i'm bitter, i can't afford to buy new books) who can't wait to share their newfound genius at having read said new ""it"" book. they want to tell you... ooh, but erin hasn't read it yet, has she? ugh. well we'll just have to discuss later, then. *SIGH*"". have you read it yet? have you read it yet? have you read it yet? have you---OW.

""OW"" being the moment i use aforementioned freshly purchased ""it"" book to smack someone over the head, thus ending my brief first and last encounter with said book, forever. unless it wins a nobel prize and i'm required to read it for sake of my intelligence. which has NEVER HAPPENED.

*spoiler alert* HOWEVER. (sorry, this all caps thing is growing on me)
however, a used copy of the time travelers wife was the biggest book i could find in the bargin bin before i boarded my 5 hour flight back to the east coast this holiday season, and therefore i found myself starting a novel that's been beaten over my head by all my bffs since it came out. and let me tell you, small cabin space and an a measly in-flight movie selection of ""the game plan"" and ""george lopez's shitty sitcom whatever it's called"" were the only things keeping me from dropping my interest throughout the first couple of chapters. i wanted to like these characters, because i like time travel, and anyone who gets to try it out should definitely also be cool. but i kept wondering, when does it get good? when does it get good? when does it get---

and i'm not sure when it happened, but suddenly it got GOOD. i mean, really good. it wasn't really enough for me, just wondering when claire and henry would get together, because, to be honest, i wasn't that invested in their characters. i can't explain this, because i can't pinpoint the reason. the quality of writing was decent, i can find no specific thread to rant on about the characters not being developed... there was just no hook. after the first tiny intro at the very very beginning, i kept waiting for that sense of urgency to come back. and then it did. suddenly, beautifully, there was so much for them to live for, and as soon as i got that lovely, dreadful inkling that henry was going to die... of COURSE he has to die, shut up, i didn't spoil anything, this is a love story... then i couldn't get enough. i think the build up of flash backs helped incredibly in this as well, because after i had gained this huge database of memories i was inexplicably and wonderfully tied up in the drama of their stories. it was a slow, eventual build, but the payoff was WELL (there's that caps button again! god it's fun) worth it. 

which, let me tell you, almost never happens in these cases (unless you write ""a million little pieces"" and oprah shoves her big foot in her mouth and people like me get to watch the spectle on cnn between episodes of ""arrested developement"". lovely. 

ps. in a random, non funny tangent, i would also like to briefly comment on the fact that she wouldn't give up having her all important baby. wow, annoying. i felt just as tired as henry. give it up woman, you're wasting precious time with him and exhausting everybody on your insane quest. don't get me wrong, i felt really bad for her during the first part... but SIX miscarriages? i know there's an element like ""who could handle that much sadness"", but i got to thinking, ""who could bring that much death on themselves""? where is the point where you say, it's not going to work, and i'll accept that? i was frustrated because i felt like she was spending what little time she had with henry making him worried about everything when they could have just been... living. 
there.
done.
DONE.
wooooooo"
1374,Echo,The Princess Bride,"Oct 01, 2007",5,"I feel the need to gush. I've set aside the many books I want to read for the moment in favor of rereading this one. I loved it when I read it way back in about the sixth grade, so I thought it was time I give it another shot.

As much as I loved it as a kid, I love it more now. Maybe because I can appreciate it on different levels. I'm only about halfway through on my reread, but I've come to the conclusion that Goldman is a genius. The story, characters, and dialogue are impressive enough, but then you add in the whole bit about Morgernstern. I mean, here Goldman wrote this amazing story, and then he makes up a story about another man who wrote the story. Then he makes up a fictional story about his father reading him this story written by someone else, and later about his process of ""abridging"" the story. He even makes up a fictional wife and son who play their own parts in this. He throws in asides written by himself, and asides written by Mogernstern, and asides written by himself about the asides written by Morgernstern. He claims to have written a reunion scene that readers can request to have sent to them by the publisher, and when people did write in for it, Goldman sent them back a letter all about the legal reasons he could not send them the scene - all fictional, of course. (The man had me going for years. I read this thing when I was in sixth grade, mind you. I didn't realize there was no S. Morgernstern until I was in college.)

Anyway, while I was absolutely enthralled with this book, it occured to me today that I would put it on par with some of the greats, like Twain. The literary devices, the story, the wit, the satire (I think he's even satiric regarding satire itself) - I don't care if it got turned into a silly movie with a cult following*, I think this one of the few modern books I've read that I'd call Literature.

Plus, you know, it's also an amazing story. Zoo of Death, the most beautiful woman in the world, the Dread Pirate Roberts, a prince plotting murder to start a war, a hunchback criminal mastermind, a giant, the greatest swordfighter on the planet, true love, revenge . . . who doesn't love that sort of thing? The man is a genius.


* No disrespect of the movie intended. It's good. Mind you, it was the first movie I'd watched that I'd read the book first, and it devastated me. I mean it absolutely broke my heart. None of the charactes looked right. Everything was changed. The sharks were turned into eels. This person spoke a line meant for that person. Things were left out. It was all wrong. It just wasn't the book and I didn't like it. I've resigned myself to it since then, and admitted that yes, the movie is good and I forgive it it's shortcomings. It did the best it could. The movie can't help it it's not as amazing as the book. There are so many things that just can't be translated to film, and there's no help for it."
1375,Melanie,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Jan 05, 2018",5,"‚ÄúSome day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly.‚Äù


So, I wanted 2018 to be the year that I try to get back into classics! In the past, I‚Äôve found some of them daunting to read, or just too boring to ever feel invested in. But I feel like The Picture of Dorian Gray was the perfect start.


Beautiful art by saku-chann on Tumblr

I originally was going to give this three stars, because I enjoyed it enough, but was never too invested. I felt annoyed at how these characters were so obviously not straight. I mean, a vast majority of this book is about Dorian taking a wife. Meanwhile, every man in this book just has full page monologues telling Dorian how beautiful he is. And then I sat down to do my review, and I started doing my research. 

It‚Äôs no secret that Oscar Wilde was a gay man. Hell, he was even jailed for his sexuality, and died soon after from all the inhumane injuries he endured while in prison. All three major male character in this book read very‚Ä¶ not straight. My friend, Destiny, told me that a lot of readers in the Horror circles make strong arguments that Dorian is in fact pansexual, which makes me happier than I can express with words. Yet, I can‚Äôt help but think about parallels with this book that Wilde crafted about ‚Äúsecret sin‚Äù and how it mirrored his life and perhaps his sexuality that he ultimately died for. 

You guys, I have no words. In the 1880s people thought homosexuality was some disease, something to be cured, something not okay to simply just be. Something that was a criminal act. Something that Oscar Wilde was jailed and forced to do hard labor for. And once you start seeing the similarities between Wilde‚Äôs life and the events that take place in this book, you will realize that like The Picture of Dorian Gray is so much more important that the surface value of just reading this story. 

Okay, I do suppose I should tell you about the story now. This is a tale that centers around three men that live in an upper-class London society: 

‚ûΩ Basil Hallward - Artist who befriends Dorian because he is obsessed with his beauty and lives his life painting many portraits of him, but more importantly, he paints the portrait that this story surrounds.

 ‚ûΩ Lord Henry Wotton - Basil's friend, which is how he meets Dorian. Henry is a manipulator that heavily influences Dorian with his views about what is important in life. 

‚ûΩ Dorian Gray - Our main character, who starts out so young, innocent, and impressionable. He later is harboring a major secret and will stop at nothing to hide this secret and the events that lead him to this secret.



‚ÄúThere are only two kinds of people who are fascinating - people who know absolutely everything and people who know absolutely nothing.‚Äù


In this book, the value of appearance is heavily touched upon. Youth and beauty seem to be everyone‚Äôs priority. It‚Äôs scary and sad how much this also mirrors 2018. There is also a huge discussion to be had about good versus evil and how we view that grey area in-between. Yet, these discussions are held in this seamlessly woven story. 

Overall, I really enjoyed it and it was able to evoke a lot of emotion from me. More importantly, I recommend you all to read My dear friend Navessa‚Äôs review, which ended up evoking even more emotion from me. She linked this article, which then made me weep. Again, this story is so much more than a paranormal painting, and a man trying to hide secrets. This is a masterpiece and my heart will forever break thinking about this story. 

Trigger/content warnings: death, murder, suicide, and a ton of misogynistic comments.

Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf üê∫

HEY LOOK AT ME FINALLY PICKING UP THIS SERIES!

As a newbie in this whole Shadowhunter universe, all I can say is that this world is pretty weird. Maybe if I was reading this 12 years ago, things would‚Äôve seemed to be different, but now as a 20-something year old I am not so into the world just yet. It is at the same time childishly simple and complicated. I‚Äôm sure it would grow on me, I mean, that should be the whole point of a series with 
that
 many volumes. But for now I am only going to categorise it as weird.

I also cannot say that the plot of this particular book did not baffle me, because it did. There were some parts where I thought that things just fall perfectly into place, but some others...Jesus, really? Like, for one (maybe a tiny spoiler but so many people have read this book already that is not even relevant anymore), how the fuck did that vampire tore open Clary‚Äôs backpack and stole a rat all ‚Äúby mistake‚Äù without Clary to notice is beyond me.

Now, cutting off all that negativity I‚Äôve spilt like tea, let‚Äôs talk about positive things. Yay.

How much do you think I love Clary, Simon, Jace, Isabelle and Alec? The answer is: actually very much. Like, for real, are they accepting submission letters to their cult because I am in, what the hell. 

Clary Fray is, to me, a bit of a head-in-the-clouds type of girl, a bit silly and na√Øve, and excepting the fact that she got so fast so cool with all this weird voodoo batshit happening in her life all of a sudden, she is really nice. Simon ‚Äì the same as Clary. Maybe a bit sassier.

Isabelle is that type of superhot but super scary girl (the cool stuff, you know) that is a bit overly narcissistic but can dominate every idiot that dares to breath wrong in her presence. Kinda my type of cool girl. 

As for Alec, her brother‚Ä¶boy, I love him. I really do. He is the right amount of sexy, shy, awkward and badass, all that mixed with a big heart and a strong impression of not knowing how to express feelings. You just got to love him! Oh and I can already see something blossoming between him and Magnus and I am so here for that to happen!

Now, about Jace, all I can say is that he can charm the pants off of you and you‚Äôd probably thank him for that. 

In my opinion, Jace is the best part of (at least) this book and I am always going to be looking forward the parts where he‚Äôs being himself. He is charming and witty and selfish and cruel. But he has some of the best moments. And because of the fact that I haven‚Äôt seen The Mortal Instruments films or The Shadowhunters TV series, in my head there was this constant portrait of Jace that my brain painted for my mind‚Äôs eye and in my mind, Jace looks exactly like Toby Regbo who played Prince Francis II in 
Reign
. I just couldn‚Äôt picture him otherwise! Put some sexy runes on that Prince Francis and there you have Jace Wayland, my version. 

***OOPS MY FINGER SLIPPED***
 

Okay, living my inappropriate behaviour aside (shame on me, what can I say), I was prepared to give this book something between 3 and 3.5 stars altogether. But that ending had something else in mind.

I was so confused with everything happening that I just ignored some factors that might‚Äôve made me prepare myself for that ending 
but no
. I really can say that I didn‚Äôt see that coming. My face literally fell on the ground and I am still in a little bit of shock.

So with that being said and without further ado, I am glad to announce that I am not going to leave this series alone until I love it, so bring it on book #2, show me what you‚Äôve got!"
1377,Read with Sandee „Éª‚ù•„Éª,The Fault in Our Stars,"Jan 04, 2012",5,"But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.‚Äù

------------------

Some books will make you laugh so hard your stomach will hurt.
Some books will make you so mad that you‚Äôd want to throw the book out the window or burn it in fury.
Some books will leave you asking for more because it ended with a cliffhanger.
Some books will leave you questioning why it ended the way it did.
Some books will leave a mark on you not only because it made you cried buckets of tears or made you laugh until you couldn‚Äôt breathe but because you felt something as you were reading it and that feeling would never leave you forever.
The Fault in Our Stars left that kind of mark in me.
It made me cry.
It made me laugh occasionally.
It made my heart ache.
It made me giggly all over when Gus made his moves on Hazel.
It made me feel all sort of things and for a book to have that effect on someone it must be really special.
The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read.
EVER!

Hazel has cancer.
She already anticipated Death would soon be knocking on her door.
She doesn‚Äôt have a lot of friends because she keeps to herself.
Why? 
She didn‚Äôt want anyone else to be burdened by her death in case it comes.
One day at support group he met Augustus (Gus) Waters.
They just sort of clicked.
Gus liked her but she didn‚Äôt want to take their relationship to a higher level because she was afraid that she‚Äôd cause him pain if she dies.
Hazel think Gus was healthier than she is and that he‚Äôll have more time on earth than she does and that it would be unfair if she lets him in.
But no matter how hard she tries to keep her distance from Gus, she just couldn‚Äôt.
Everything felt right.
Fate however has different plans for them.

There are so many things I want to say about this book but I‚Äôm so afraid I might not get them all right.
John Green, you have broken my heart into tiny little pieces.
This book made my heart ache and my eyes burn with tears.
There was just so much emotion in the pages of this book that it was so hard not to feel them.

Hazel was an inspiration.
I have never been that sick but I think if I was I wouldn‚Äôt be as composed and as strong as she was.
Despite her constant need to have an oxygen tank near her she still goes about and does things normally.
She doesn‚Äôt go out that much with friends though because she wanted to spare them the pain if ever she dies.
And while Hazel was sometimes (most of the time) pessimistic, Gus was the exact opposite.
He was Hazel‚Äôs ray of sunshine.
He has this sort of halo of positivity that makes the people feel good including Hazel.
While Hazel was my inspiration, Gus was my favorite.
I guess this book would not have been that much of a success without Gus.
He was smart (though he often doesn‚Äôt think so) and funny and sweet and kind and loving.
(Damn! Where are all the Gus‚Äôs hiding? I‚Äôd like to get myself one! LOL.)

I finished this book last night after coming home from work.
On the last 3 or 4 chapters my eyes were flooded with tears that I can‚Äôt stop.
My mom actually got worried and asked me if I was okay and told her the reason I was crying was because of this book.

The Fault in Our Stars was amazing.
I would like to applaud Mr. Green for making such a wonderful and emotionally gripping novel that mirrors the lives of kids who has cancer.
Hazel, Gus, Isaac and all of the other kids in the memorial maybe fictional characters but what they were experiencing maybe happening to someone else right now.
The characters in this book seemed so real like you and me.
Hazel and Gus seemed too mature for their age.
Was it the cancer? Possibly but it‚Äôs actually something so minor that I don‚Äôt care if they think too maturely. I can deal with that.

One thing I noticed though was how it reminded me a little (really just a little) of one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks, A Walk to Remember.
Gus reminded me of Jaime.
Gus changed something in Hazel just like Jaime did to Langdon.
Jaime and Gus left their mark.
They may have passed but they will never be forgotten.

Anyhow, I totally love this book.
I highly recommend it.
No graphic scenes here so in my opinion it‚Äôs totally safe for the teenage kids to read. :)

I am so in love with you Mr. Green.
Too bad you‚Äôre married and with kids. (Just kidding!)

But my friends and I will be reading Looking for Alaska next hopefully they would be as great as this one.


I give this perfect 5 stars!"

The Written Review
:

 If you haven't read this as an adult - pick it up today
I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks.
 I (along with millions of other kids) first read this in grade-school. And I (along with those millions) didn't really get the point.

I remember thinking, Well... I already know discrimination is wrong. I don't get why I have to read a book about it... 

Oh Lordy, if I could go back in time...

Rereading led to a (unsurprisingly) wholly different interpretation of this novel.  I am in awe of Harper Lee and what she's written. 

How could I have so completely missed the point back in fifth grade? 
People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.
 We follow Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, the daughter of Atticus Finch - a prominent lawyer. Scout narrates the great and terrible tragedies of her life - namely the trial of Tom - an upstanding ""colored"" man accused of raping a white woman. 

Atticus is appointed to defend Tom and soon, nearly the whole town turns against the Finch Family. 
I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.
 Much like Scout, I was simply too young to understand much of what was going on the first time through. 

I tell you, there were so, so many moments this time through where the light bulb turned on and everything just clicked. 
As you grow older, you‚Äôll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don‚Äôt you forget it‚Äîwhenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash
 My entire life, I never truly understood why this was such a classic, why people read it over and over, and why this (of all books) is forced upon kids year after year. I get it now. And I'm disappointed that I hadn't reread it sooner. 

P.s. Sorry to my teachers for being such a sulky kid - they sure picked a great one. I was just so enthralled with reading other things that I didn't read this one as well as I should've. 
Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.

1379,Hannah Azerang,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ,"Dec 22, 2014",5,I had to re read it. I was in such a nostalgic mood.
1380,Mutasim Billah,The Giving Tree,"Aug 03, 2018",4,"For such a small children's book The Giving Tree has managed to polarize opinions on a very interesting topic: the joy of giving. At what point does selflessness equal madness and folly, or at what point is unconditional love become toxic behavior?



The story is of a boy and an apple tree. The boy grows up and keeps demanding of the tree and the tree keeps on lovingly providing for the boy until there is nothing left but a stump.



Silverstein initially found it difficult to get The Giving Tree published as publishers thought the subject matter was too sad for children. However, upon release, the book became increasingly popular by word-of-mouth. Christian schools and churches found the subject matter of the joys of giving very much to the tastes of biblical stories. Other readers had less favorable views of the story. For instance, the boy in the book never seemed to thank the tree, leading to readers speaking out that the boy was exploiting the tree. Some even went as far as calling the relationship between the boy and tree as masochistic."
1381,Matthew,A Wrinkle in Time ,"Jun 29, 2020",2,"I read this one a few years ago and just realized I never gave it a star review. I did read it when I wasn't always writing reviews, so here is a brief take on what I remember . . .

I had high hopes for this one because it is considered a classic. Many people read this one when they are in elementary/middle school and I remember back when I was that age hearing my fellow students singing its praises. A bit odd that I never tried it back then! When I finally got to it as an adult, those hopes I had built up were not lived up to.

Maybe if I had read it as a kid I would have felt different. But, to adult me it was just a bizarre and haphazard series of events - and not in a good way. I struggled to stay interested or even be able to tell what was going on. I do remember that since it is highly revered I fought my hardest to find something that I enjoyed about it.

You shouldn't have to fight to enjoy something if it is truly meant for you.

So, it is not one that I can recommend, but I am glad many love it and have fond memories of it."
1382,Lizzy,The Princess Bride,"Jul 28, 2015",5,"‚ÄúGood night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.‚Äù
Just a glimpse of  The Princess Bride to wet your appetite. Wow, I loved it! The book is about true love and adventure. It has everything, as William Goldman describes in the beginning: 

‚ÄúFencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True Love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest Ladies. Snakes. Spiders... Pain. Death. Brave men. Cowardly men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles‚Äù.
 Despite setbacks and misfortune along the way, there is a feeling that everything will turn out all right in the end, and it does. But it‚Äôs also about friendship. Inigo, the greatest swordsman in the world, and Fezzik, the gentle giant that loved rhymes, are great! The scene when they go down the Zoo of Death together is memorable and shows how superb a writer Goldman is. 

‚ÄúTwo things happened:
(1) The door, quite clearly, locked.
(2) Out went the candles on the high walls.
""DON'T BE FRIGHTENED!"" Inigo screamed.
""I'M NOT, I'M NOT!"" Fezzik screamed.‚Äù
So yes, read The Princess Bride and see the movie. Maybe even better than the book, hard to tell, as I saw it a long time ago. But it‚Äôs worth a rerun!
 
Some other quotes I loved:

‚ÄúNow what happens?"" asked the man in black. 
""We face each other as God intended,"" Fezzik said. ""No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.""
""You mean you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people, is that it?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople don't remember me. Really. It's not a paranoid thing; I just have this habit of slipping through memories. It doesn't bother me all that much, except I guess that's a lie; it does. For some reason, I test very high on forgettability.‚Äù
 
And some more:

‚ÄúLove is many things none of them logical.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook. (Grow-ups skip this paragraph.) I'm not about to tell you this book has a tragic ending. I already said in the very first line how it is my favorite in all the world. But there's a lot of bad stuff coming up, torture you've already been prepared for, but there's worse. There's death coming up, and you better understand this: Some of the wrong people die. Be ready for it. This isn't Curious George Uses the Potty. Nobody warned me and it was my own fault (you'll see what I mean in a little) and that was my mistake, so I'm not letting it happen to you. The wrong people die, some of them, and the reason is this: life is not fair. Forget all the garbage your parents put out.‚Äù

1383,Dannii Elle,The Secret Garden,"Sep 02, 2015",4,"Actual rating 4.5/5 stars.

I have vivid memories of reading this renowned children's classic when I was very young. I can distinctly recall my shock at reading a book with such an initially dislikable protagonist, the likes of which I had not yet discovered during my few years of reading. I was intrigued by the petulant Mary Lennox and was enchanted by her discovery of the secret garden. This, I believe, was my my first introduction to dark and brooding main characters, and probably even honed my later love for female Gothic fiction, so I am eternally indebted to it, for that.

It has now been many years since my young repeated readings of this book and I tried to divorce these emotions from my present reading. Whether or not I was successful I could not say, but this still entranced me just as much as it did as a child. This book has always held a nostalgic place in my heart but I now love it even more for the joy it continued to bring to my adult self."
1384,Lara,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Mar 17, 2008",4,"I am conflicted about this book. Do not let my 4 stars fool you, they are an emotional rating.

I'll start with the things I really liked about it:

Loved all the foreshadowing. The knowing something was going to happen, and maybe even a little bit of what it was, but never knowing or understanding fully until both characters had experienced the moment. And then all the foreshadowing of the tragic end. Once I started putting the puzzle together I really couldn't put it down. And I had several moments where I couldn't control the tears even long before the tragedy happens, because the foreshadowing was that emotionally charged.

I felt that the way the author set it up was ingenious. While you are reading along in a fairly chronological timeline, it is interspersed with moments of past and future as Henry travels through time. At first it felt very disjunct, but by the end I really loved the way it mirrored how Henry and Clare must feel as they lived their life in such a non-chronological manner. Especially Henry.

The love story was indeed epic. I bawled like a baby at the end, it was so tragic to me. And sweet at the same time. The way that the author addressed themes of love, fate, destiny, personal choice and, of course, time was mind blowing at times (as all time travel issues are to me) but very cool to see how it all intertwined. I liked how she dealt with the whole time travel issue in that Henry could never actually change anything in the future. Everything already happened, whether in the past or the future, because for Henry, his future is his past and his past is his future. I told you it was a bit mind blowing. But yeah, the love story was riveting.

Things I didn't like so much:

The absolutely uneccesary detail of the mundane. I felt the author spent too much time describing grocery lists (literally!) of things and music and whatever when she could have been examining the thoughts and feelings of the characters. It took me 3 weeks to read this book, and not because it was long. I didn't have any problem ignoring it for days at a time because of the tedious reading at times. Nothing in the writing made me want to keep reading until the last half of the book, which I did read much more quickly.

The language. F-word on nearly every page. Two sitings of the C-word. Totally unnecessary. The love scenes were often a bit graphic, and there were so many of them. Because of this, I started feeling that the love was based in sex more than anything and I would have like the author to explore some of the more deep feelings that did show up when Henry and Clare weren't in bed. Again, unnecessary really.

Sometimes I got confused and experienced deja vu. Knowing it was because one of the characters had already mentioned a certain event and I would often have to go through the book and find the previous mention so I could have full understanding.

Mostly though, it was a very cool book. And very emotional...at least for me. It really spoke to something in me about relationships and choices and destiny (not that I totally believe in destiny, but you know.)p"
1385,Kerri,The Secret Garden ,"Jun 07, 2019",5,"One of my most cherished books. üíñ

Somewhere around the age of seven or eight I came across a beautiful book in my local library that contained both The Secret Garden and A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett. I instantly latched onto it and completely fell in love with the two stories. Over the years I checked that book out again and again, and eventually got my own copies. 

There is something about The Secret Garden that is so hard to capture in a review. From that first reading, and for every single reread over the years, it has been the perfect book. Everything about it works for me - the characters are among my favourite ever created, especially Dickon, who is so perfect in such a beautifully real way. Both Mary and Colin are in many ways unlikable characters, especially earlier on, yet I still adore them. 
 They behave appallingly, but they have also been starved of attention, love and discipline. Their journey over the course of the book, and the way they help each other evolve into better people is so wonderful to follow. 

And the garden - that magical garden. It always completely sparked my imagination, and something I really noticed during this read was how poignant the descriptions of magic are in this book - the magic of nature and friendship and the way thoughts can have such an impact on us. It could easily sound preachy I suppose, but somehow it doesn't, at least not to me.

I undoubtedly approach this book with an almost overwhelming sense of nostalgia, and am already so firmly in love with it that I cannot really do anything other than admire it. It's a magical book with a magical garden!

1386,Nataliya,Jane Eyre,"May 02, 2010",4,"Yes, I suppose you can view this book mostly as a love story. That's what I did at age 13 - but that's why I was left disappointed back then¬π.



Or you can view this as an story of formation of a strong and independent female protagonist, a nineteenth-century feminist, light-years ahead of its time. And that's what left my now-closer-to-thirty-than-twenty self very satisfied and, quite frankly, rather impressed.¬≤¬π(view spoiler)[The guy kept his wife in the attic. Seriously - no. Just no. You don't get all the way to your SECOND wedding forgetting to mention that your FIRST wife is hidden in the attic. Seriosly, Rochester, what the hell is wrong with you? How can you even attempt to build a marriage on such a lie??? (hide spoiler)] 

¬≤ ""I do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.""

Sing it, Jane. You tell him, you strong and awesome woman, you!
When I read it for the first time as a young and opinionated teen, I thought Jane Eyre was a boring and meek protagonist, too clingy to her 'outdated' morals, too afraid to do what I thought was a brave thing to do - say 'yes' to the apparent happiness that poor tragic Mr. Rochester was offering. (Oh naive young me, putting way too much stock in Rochester's woes after his (view spoiler)[first marriage (hide spoiler)], sleeping with everyone in Europe and rejecting them probably because they were not English enough for him!) Wow, was there ever a way to misunderstand a book more than I did this one? Sometimes life experience does matter indeed.

Jane Eyre has a good idea of her self-worth. And she has a good idea about her own morals. And, unlike many in her situation, she sticks to her morals and her idea of what is wrong or right regardless of what outcome is in it for her. Here is the prime example:""Gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their governesses.""The emphasis in this well-intentioned advice by Mrs. Fairfax is on the word MARRY. Ah, silly old lady, one may think, cautioning the young woman in such a prudish way. Ah, silly young woman, taking the advice of the old lady and acting prudishly. Ah, silly young woman, eventually rejecting the sincere love and offer of happiness for a seemingly prudish reason - not wanting to be a mistress. So old-fashioned and weak and caged-up, screamed my thirteen-year-old self.

But here's the thing. It's not just for the moral lesson for the readers that Bronte has Jane firmly say 'no'. It's not for the sake of mere societal appearance. It's for the sake of Jane, and Jane alone. MARRYING governesses was uncommon. Having them as mistresses - probably not as rare. In her society, protecting her virtue and reputation was not only the matter of religious views or stigma - it was the question of her future, as she had nobody to stand up for her if her reputation was ruined. And it was a question of her integrity - the quality that she maintains through thick and thin, refusing to fall head over heels for love, refusing to let love justify all the mistakes and wrong choices, refusing to let love blind her to everything else that was important for her sense of self-worth.



By refusing Rochester, Jane stays so true to herself without ever betraying herself. Jane refuses to take the steps that would destroy her integrity in her own eyes, and for that she has my strongest and most sincere respect and admiration. What Rochester did is unthinkable to her - not because of how others view it but because of her morals and convictions - and she shows unbelievable courage in sticking up for what she believes in, even if it is to her own material and soul-wrecking detriment. She will not give herself fully to something - or someone - that would destroy her integrity, tarnish her own self. And I love her for this unwavering determination to stay true to herself! ""Reader, I married him"" may be one of the most famous phrases from this book (actually, the most famous, come to think of it) - but it is her refusal to marry him in the first place that allows her to keep her integrity and remain true to self, and continue developing into the amazing person she becomes. Jane has too much self-worth to have Rochester until he redeems himself in her eyes, until he repents. That's the point, not the marriage part.Despite self-proclaimed meekness, Jane Eyre is far from weak or scared. She has been forced to make her own way in life without the luxury of relying on a rich male relative - father, brother, husband. And she did this in the world where being attached to a man was the best choice for a woman (just remember Jane Austen's heroines a few decades earlier reaching happiness only after finding a suitable gentleman!). She is a rebel - setting out to have her own career in a male-dominated world, refusing to let a man rule her life (that applies to both Rochester and St. John here), and making statements that may have not had the most sympathetic audience back in her day:""Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.""And here's what else I enjoyed about this book - its attempts to subvert the tropes, the same tropes that we still heavily rely on in literature. Bronte gets rid of the 'faultless' heroine - instead of being perfect (or having an imaginary flaw, like many literary heroines are prone to nowadays) Jane has a real one (for her time, at least) - her occasional temper. And she is not beautiful - not fake flaws, either but a consensus by many impartial observers that she is not a beauty. And to take it a step further - Mr. Rochester, our romantic lead, is quite frankly, rather ugly. This is not a beautiful couple (and Hollywood managed to ""fix"" that in all the movie adaptations, by the way - a slap in Bronte's face, I guess?). Jane is not in love with a pretty fa√ßade of Rochester - since he has none (a thing that contemporary writers should learn, by the way - writing love that stems from something else that simple attraction to physical beauty). 



And finally, the atmosphere of this story. Oh, the wonderfully gothic atmosphere written so well, with intense moods palpable in every paragraph. So colorful, so vivid, so immersing - every room, every moor, every tree. Every description of landscape or interior actually serves a purpose to establish the mood of the scene, and it is very well-done.
.................................
All that said, I'm giving a condescending pat on the shoulder to my teenage self from the 'wisdom' of another fifteen years. Sorry, teen Nataliya, you little annoying know-it-all - you just needed to grow up to appreciate this story. 4.5 stars and high recommendation."
1387,Matthew,Les Mis√©rables,"Jan 09, 2013",5,"I dreamed a dream of reading this book - and I accomplished it! Surprisingly easy to read - even though it did take quite some time. Hugo does go off on quite a few tangents, but the whole experience was fantastic!"
1388,chai ‚ô°,Wuthering Heights,"Jul 11, 2022",5,"I'm just on fire with so much admiration for Emily Bront√´ right now. Having read this book, I now understand why it‚Äôs generated such fierce controversy since its first publication in 1847. Why early reviews dismissed it as an aberration (with one pearl-clutching reviewer wondering ‚Äúhow a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters‚Äù) and why writers like Sylvia Plath and E.M. Forster, drawn to the complex and often contradictory open vein of the novel, went out of their way to reject such easy classifications. 

This review is, in many ways, my attempt to understand how Wuthering Heights continues to enable many difficult and contradictory stances even today, entrenching its legacy as one of the most dynamic and generative novels of the 19th century. 

The first element that makes Wuthering Heights so interesting is form. The novel is presented as a series of second‚Äîeven third‚Äîhand accounts, a story rehearsed and sanitized by multiple re-enactors with the reader being the last in a succession of interpreters. In other words, the story changes hands multiple times, often between hostile and uncomprehending narrators, before it makes its way to the reader. This structure is nuanced in multiple ways; it is also very tricky, for it depends entirely on the reader‚Äôs willingness to turn to Nelly‚Äîthe central narrator‚Äîfor an authoritative interpretation of the story. Nelly, however, is not a very sympathetic narrator, and her thinly veiled bias against (or for) the characters brings into question the validity of her account. We are forced into awareness, again and again, of the flawed nature of Nelly's interpretations and of the uncrossable distances that lie between what we are reading and what the story is. It is precisely this awareness which challenges us to take nothing at face value and demands our active participation in the process of meaning-making.

To put it differently: faced with the possibility of the novel as the culmination of a flawed‚Äîeven failed‚Äîinterpretation, one can only read Wuthering Heights with a kind of longing, with the desire to get close to something inconsolable, just beyond reach. Therein lies, the novel says, the potential for true understanding: in the underground currents of emotion, the not-easily-reached places far beneath the surface of what the reader can see and understand. It is this frame of reference‚Äîhowever flawed, failed, or imperfect‚Äîthat gives the characters a context in which we can begin to accept, understand, and grapple for their ultimate depths.

This brings us to the second element which makes Wuthering Heights such productive fodder for interpretation: the characters. In a story that is told at one, two, sometimes three removes, Bront√´‚Äôs characters are not at all remote. Bront√´ brings a depth of anguish to the characters and engages our compassion no matter how unflattering and biased the gaze through which we see them. This is nowhere as gorgeously epitomized as in the characters of Heathcliff and Catherine, with whom lays the broken heart of Wuthering Heights. 

Heathcliff‚Äôs vehemence, his grief and naked want, Catherine‚Äôs selfishness, her strain and struggle against the confines of her life‚Äîthese things are rendered so honestly and so rawly in a way that appealed to me despite, sometimes because of, their deep abiding wrongness. Wuthering Heights is not just a story about a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù romantic attachment between two deeply broken and detestable characters. In fact, to argue the degree to which Heathcliff and Catherine‚Äôs relationship was ‚Äútoxic‚Äù or ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù seems less relevant to me than the incontrovertible fact that in a world that would not let them be whole, Catherine and Heathcliff lent meaning to each other. To me, this is where the simple truth of Wuthering Heights lies: in Catherine and Heathcliff's longing to be recognized by each other in a way that defies and transcends ‚Äúseparation,‚Äù and in the subsequent void and loss they suffer when one is intolerably deprived of the other. 

Wuthering Heights returns over and over to this theme of identity through the other, the desire to be defined in terms of an ‚Äúexistence‚Ä¶ beyond‚Äù our ‚Äúcontained‚Äù selves. For Catherine and Heathcliff, their very sense of ‚Äúself‚Äù was sustained through the bond of devotion they forged between them in childhood, back when they were flashing with youth and magic and hunger, and their passion for each other has always illuminated the gap between who they longed to be, and who they actually were. Invoking Heathcliff, Catherine confesses to Nelly at one point that ‚ÄúHe's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.‚Äù In this way, Wuthering Heights is so truthful about what it means to be human: to desire to be known by another as intimately, as completely, as one knows their own image in a mirror, to love and despise and long for and tire of each other because it is a much merciful fate than a lifetime of emptiness, silence, and absence. 

Under this light, it is easy to understand Heathcliff‚Äôs and Catherine‚Äôs unraveling, and in understanding, to love and pity them. We understand that in losing Heathcliff, Catherine lost her life, and in losing her, Heathcliff lost himself. All the proofs of passion, all the crawling devotions that sustained him in youth have yielded to nothingness, and somewhere inside Heathcliff a dam has broken, with nothing in its stead to stave off the madness of being alone, or to ward off the unpurged ghosts of a brutal past. 

Through Heathcliff‚Äôs unraveling, Bront√´ lays a carefully layered, generational look at the reverberating effects of trauma and what it costs to give others so much power over us. Raised with the stigma of illegitimacy and of deviancy (and potentially of race, but that‚Äôs an essay for another day), and subjected to a childhood of casual abuse, name-calling and cruelty, Heathcliff spends the years following Catherine‚Äôs death trying to methodically reproduce his traumatic past, his experiences of degradation and loss, in others. Heathcliff, ultimately, does not just preserve the memory of Catherine, which he feels bound to, but rather transform it into something else, into a display of his wound in full.

It is impossible not to feel at once entranced and horrified and rocked by the horror of what Heathcliff becomes, not to ache with sympathy for a younger version of Heathcliff. But I found myself hurting more for Cathy, Hareton, and Linton, and the complex, many-generationed hatreds that twisted between them. Wuthering Heights paints one of the clearest portraits of generational trauma that I‚Äôve ever read. Bront√´'s use of intimate domestic spaces as prison, her disfiguring of family into a site for violence, evil, and struggle, and her deliberate re-creation of past trauma in the second generation‚Äîis masterful. The result is a novel that understands so thoroughly, so completely, and with bone-deep care that the scars inflicted by childhood abuse, by trauma, by the generational inheritance of atrocious memory, do not just fade away; they stay and linger and fester until we all become a casualty of each other. 

That Wuthering Heights was conceived and published before the advent of psychology is absolutely wild to me. The novel is a profoundly haunting experience of a book, one that I am sure will dog my thoughts for a very, very long time."

           IMPORTANT EDIT (1/14/18):
Fam, I wrote this review in 2011. 

All of y'all commenting in 2018 need to get over it. I've moved to a different account. I've moved past Cassandra Clare and while I maintain that this book is a blatant rip off of about 1000 other books (and while a lot of you insist that she's an original author, like it or not, she does have a history with plagiarism/bad behavior), I haven't read any of her new stuff so I can't tell you if she's continued to toe the line with plagiarism or write poorly. In fact, I can tell you that a lot of people whose opinions I trust say that she's become a much better, more original writer. I've even considered reading some of her newer books. 

If you enjoy her writing, good for you. If these books she's written are important to you, I'm happy for you. My opinions are my opinions, you don't have to share them. 

What's really gross is the amount of bullying and personal attacks that are going on in these comments and in messages I've received. While I do regret some of the harshness of the original view, attacking me or anyone else in the comments (on either side of the fence) is gross. I've received abuse about my looks, about my writing abilities (I don't write), about my sex life (people implying I should get laid), about my mental health, and even a few messages telling me to kill myself. All because you don't like my opinion of a book. Guys, even if you hate this review, you have to see that this is way too much.

I've grown up since writing this review and I sincerely hope that some of you have matured, too, since writing some of the hate that I've read (some of of which I've deleted) in these comments. Please stop. Please move on. 

Review from 1/24/11:
I've been deliberating for a few hours over doing a Serious Business review of City of Bones and outlining the infinite number of problems that lie within, but I decided that any critical thought that I could flesh out isn't going to be anything that you've never heard before. Therefore, I choose the low road - sarcasm and mockery.

Oh, Cassie Clare, you so crazy. I can only guess that after writing almost a million words of Harry Potter fan fiction, a bunch of people sucking your e-cock for stealing whole paragraphs from books and quotes from Buffy simply wasn't enough. No, I understand. You had to capitalize on all that time spent typing up whole paragraphs from books and outlining plots that pretty blatantly ripped off from various films, books, etc. I get it. I'm sure that's how the Mortal Instruments came to fruition. It is painfully obvious that your dopey red-haired ingenue and snarky blond asshole were essentially Ginny Weasley and Draco Malfoy in Original Character clothing. Ditto Simon being a hybrid of Harry/Ron and maybe Isabelle being a slutty Hermione. But wait, you didn't stop there! Hodge is Lupin/Peter Pettigrew 2.0 and Luke is better known by his other name, Sirius Black, and I am not entirely sure why you didn't just call Valentine by his true name - Voldemort. And seriously, though, why not just call the Mortal Instruments by their true name - the Deathly Hallows? But wait, it gets better!

Strong with this novel, the Force is - because somehow there's a creepy Luke and Leia thing going on with Clary and Jace which, for the record: dude, that's nasty. How dare you let them make out and then discover they're related. Because I had to know in order to keep myself from hurling up my dinner, I did discover that this little detail does get resolved eventually, but I reiterate: that's nasty. I thought the point of this book was to make teenage girls hold their hands to their hearts and swoon, not make them want to upchuck with what I find to be your disturbing affinity for incest (seriously - you had the whole six episodes of Star Wars to steal, uh, draw inspiration from and you pick the creepy incesty parts?). But it's weird, because if Jace and Clary are Luke and Leia, does that make Simon Han Solo? In a weird way, I found Jace's whole over-confident demeanor to be more like Han, which I guess is pretty on point with what happens in later novels. In other news, I will no longer be referring to Valentine as simply that; he is now Darth Valentine. Yes, I said it. I guess this makes Jocelyn Padme, except she's not dead yet.

I must give you where credit where credit is due, though. Clary isn't a total dumb, annoying, doormat heroine, which is essentially my biggest pet peeve in the entirety of fiction. Instead, Clary is just dumb and annoying. Why the fuck does she slap everyone? It doesn't make her a strong, venerable female, it makes her a psychotic bitch, especially since there wasn't a single justifiable slap she delivered. Also, she's a moron. Blind, deaf babies knew that Simon was in love with her. My dog knew that Simon was in love with her and the most complicated thought he has in a day is, 'gee, I think I'll lick my junk today'. I have no idea why it's such a surprise to her, really. This brings me to my second greatest pet peeve and yet another trope that you liberally borrowed from, well, everyone: all the boys want Clary. What the hell is this shit? Clary isn't even likable. You stole it off of Stephenie Meyer who stole it off of L.J. Smith and frankly? You keep copying copies, the shittier-looking and harder to read they get. You are not an exception, you are the rule.

Also, okay. So the Clave is like the circle of Jedi, right? And the Circle is like the Order of the Phoenix and the Death-Eaters, sort of, but bad. So, like, Order of the Sith, kind of? Also, is Darth Valentine channeling Magneto from X-Men: The Last Stand with his whole 'purifying the race' bullshit? I think he is. Now that I've brought the X-Men into the picture, I can see the vast similarities there, too; Clary is film version Rogue and Wolverine - Rogue because she can't be with the person she loves physically (Rogue's life-sucking power = Clary's being in love with her brother) and Wolverine because of the whole not having any memories thing and wondering why he has all this power. Also, The Institute = The Knight Bus/Hogsmeade/The Leaky Cauldron (because sometimes the Institute boards travelers and there's bad food at all three places, much like Isabelle's cooking) and also Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters (and Hodge is kind of Professor Xavier-esqe - his inability to leave the institute = Professor X's disability) and also The Jedi Training Academy and also possibly Starfleet from Trek.

You know what the funniest thing about all this is, Cassie Clare? You aren't even stealth about stealing. You know, when most people shoplift, they maybe do a cursory look for the cameras and stuff something in their pocket when they think no one is looking, but you're that chick that goes up to the clerk, asks a clerk a question about a product you have in your hand while winking that you just don't have the money to pay for it. In this book there were blatant reference to both X-Men and Star Wars (Magneto and Prof. X by name and the dice hanging up in the Millennium Falcon).

Now that I've drawn all necessary attention to your totally original content, I want to talk about the story in general. I read this book because it was handed down to me by my recently-turned eleven year old niece. I figured, okay, I'll figure out what the big deal is with this book since everyone and their mom (no, really, I think my mom, too) has read it. My niece isn't what anyone would call fastidious; she hates cleaning her room and at dinner, she likes to mash all of her food together and make a sculpture with it and then eat it. Imagine my surprise when I saw that the portion of the book I borrowed from her had pages upon pages of highlighted words. I figured, aw cute, she highlighted her favorite parts. But, no, my eleven year old niece had gone through the book and highlighted grammatical errors. There were misspellings, comma splices, and just general bad phrasing all throughout. She had also highlighted words that she saw in multiples. Seriously, Cassie Clare, I get it. Every time a wolf shows up in your book, you don't have to describe it as 'brindled'. I get it. Did your word-of-the-day calendar run out? Did you lose your thesaurus? Do you have a short-term memory problem and forget that you used the word 'brindled' to describe a wolf eight times? I can't even talk about the metaphors and the similes. I can't. I used to like them. Now they make me want to punch toddlers in the face because your book is full of approximately nine hundred and thirty-three million of them. I am also not going to talk about your bizarre tense changes and the random chapter you threw in from Luke's point of view which was completely out of character for both a man and a human, let alone Luke - no one talks like that.

Another thing that I want to reference is this whole stele thing. In Tatiana's review, she mentioned that there didn't seem to be any parameters with this stele; it seemed to be a fix-it for whenever you had written yourself into a hole. I may not have noticed it had I not read the review first, given that as I was trudging through, I was filled with an irrational rage. It's a very good point, though. But since I read your book in three days just to get through it, I'm feeling like an asshole and I want to ask the following questions: can the stele make me look like Scarlett Johansson?; can the stele magic a cheeseburger out of thin air? These are questions of vital importance. Because if the stele can't, maybe you want to consider it in case one of your characters gets stuck on an island with no food for three years or something.

In conclusion, Cassie Clare, OF COURSE YOUR BOOK IS GOOD. YOU STOLE EVERYTHING IN IT FROM OTHER PEOPLE. I just want to say that I sincerely hope that you make/have made a lot of money off your books; I also hope that the people you blatantly stole your content from take it all from you when they sue you.

Here is the Reader's Digest version of this review:

The Mortal Instruments = Harry Potter/Star Wars/X-Men/possibly Star Trek
Clary Fray = Ginny Weasley/Princess Leia/Rogue/Wolverine/Uhura/Cassandra Clare, herself
Jace Wayland = Draco Malfoy/Luke Skywalker/Han Solo/Wolverine/possibly Captain Kirk
Simon = Harry/Ron/Cyclops/sometimes Han Solo/possibly Spock

Alec = token gay character/C-3P0??
Luke = Sirius Black/Chewbacca
Jocelyn = Padme
Hodge = Remus Lupin/Peter Pettigrew/Professor Xavier
Valentine = Voldemort/Darth Vader/Magneto
The Institute = The Knight Bus/Hogsmeade/The Leaky Cauldron/12 Grimmauld Place/Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters/Starfleet Academy

1390,s.penkevich,Lord of the Flies,"Sep 24, 2011",4,"This book will forever haunt me and be forever intertwined with my freshman year of high school. Its a great book for a classroom and was where I was first taught symbolism in a way that really stood out to me. This book is so rich in literary devices I remember it being the first moment where I realized the art of reading and writing as something far beyond storytelling and how much careful craft brings a work to life. I was hooked, I think from that moment on I had it in my mind that to be someone who analyzes literature was a rock-star type vocation to me. But I will also never forget the way it was taught. Our teacher, who I remain close friends with to this day, had us play a simulation for two days where we were in the same situation as the kids in the book (before we began the book) and had to discuss and plan how to organize our lives to survive on this island. Think Model UN but for Lord of the Flies. 

Reader: it was chaos. Everyone made bad deals or broke deals finding it funny to screw people over, multiple people clamored over who was in charge, people such as myself bounced from group to group doing devious deals or gossiping about what other groups were doing (I have always been a gossip queen), and by the second day we were all shouting at each other and feeling like we had somehow been so bad at this game that the teacher would never have his class play it again. Which, at that age, is sort of a mark of pride to some and so once the chaos began those few gleefully pushed for more chaos. Our teacher never interjected, only watched from afar while grading our exams from the previous week--a brilliant time management idea I've come to realize.

Finally our teacher stepped in. We eagerly awaited hearing we were terrible at this and fully destroyed the purpose of it, only to hear that this was what happened almost every single year. And then we read the book, which felt like looking into a mirror. Chilling moment to be confronted with yourself that way. He did this game every year until he retired, it's quite often cited as a favorite memory from high school for those who were there."
1391,Daniel,A Thousand Splendid Suns,"Feb 22, 2009",2,"It's apparently becoming something of a tradition for me to trash books that are not only widely loved and praised, but were specifically recommended to me by friends. Khaled Hosseini's ""A Thousand Splended Suns,"" I'm sorry to say, is going to get the same treatment. (Forgive me, Rose.) ""Splendid Suns"" has been so widely read by this point, I won't bother recounting the story, and instead simply list my objections:

- Hosseini seems incapable of creating characters with much depth to them. E.M. Forster, in ""Aspects of the Novel,"" talks about books having round characters and flat characters, with round ones being more like people you'd encounter in the real world, and flat ones being more of caricatures used to move a book's story along. The only character in ""Splendid Suns"" who approaches roundness, and he's a relatively minor character, is Mariam's father, Jalil. Everyone else is either a villain without any positive traits (Rasheed) or a hero who can do almost no wrong (Laila, Tariq, Mullah Faizullah). Even when Hosseini is depicting a child who has every right to behave badly given his circumstances (Zalmai), he can't help but depict the child as almost evil. The New York Times review of ""Splendid Suns"" said Hosseini ""creates characters who have the simplicity and primary-colored emotions of people in a fairy tale or fable."" That's pretty generous of the New York Times. I'd say Hosseini may not be able to create three-dimensional characters.

- While I appreciate Hosseini's attempt to teach a few decades of Afghan history -- a history few readers likely know in much detail -- grafting that history onto the story of one family makes for a rather creaky novel. To impart the history, Hosseini goes back and forth between giving the history through third-person narration, in Wikipedia-like prose, and putting it in his characers' mouths via dialogue -- dialogue often spoken to people who would already know the history. As a result, you sometimes get characters saying things like, ""As you know, the Taliban forces men to grow their beards long and women to wear burkas."" The cut-and-paste history lessons make the novel painful to read at times.

- Hosseini routinely uses ""harami"" (bastard) and other words from the characters' native languages in his dialogue, followed by the English translation, apparently in an attempt to bring readers closer to the Afghan culture. But it usually feels incredibly superficial, especially when the words being used aren't foreign concepts, but rather basic words -- ""brother,"" ""sister"" and the like. Hosseini and his editors also seem to forget about the trope, and cut back on the use of the foreign words in the book's later chapters. I wish they had done the same throughout the book.

- The relationship between Mariam and Laila feels completely artificial. Mariam's initial hate for and jealousy of Laila never feels remotely justified, especially given how awful her husband Rasheed is anyhow, and their coming together later feels rushed and unrealistic. Even after they form a friendship, they never seem to grow quite close enough to fully explain why Laila misses Mariam so much towards the novel's conclusion. Hosseini fails to lay the groundwork needed to justify Laila's emotions in the novel's last chapters.

- Almost the entire book is unrelentingly bleak. Don't get me wrong, I understand Afghanistan wasn't exactly Disneyland over the past few decades, but I think there were more lighthearted moments in the Book of Job than in ""Splendid Suns."" I don't mind reading a depressing novel, but Jesus. Reading ""Splendid Suns,"" I kept thinking of that old workplace poster: ""The beatings will continue until morale improves.""

I didn't completely hate ""Splendid Suns"" -- the story moved along nicely, and it gave me a little more insight into a culture I probably should know more about -- but I don't think I'll be following this one with ""The Kite Runner."" Khaled Hosseini probably doesn't need me as a reader, though. It seems he has plenty of fans."
1392,Sarah,The Alchemist,"Aug 22, 2007",2,"I feel like everyone LOVES this book, but I was kind of underwhelmed. I know that translation affects the quality of writing, but I could not get into this writing style. At all. I felt like it was totally affected and contrived. He was going for this ""fable/parable"" style, but it seemed to fail miserably. The parable-like quality was totally contrived, and I thought the ""moral"" was pretty stupid. 

Moral: everything you want and need is close to home. Take chances. Follow your ""personal legacy.""

Then....there was a supernatural element which was just plain dumb. Granted, I am not religious. I think god-fearing people get more out of this bc they can take that leap of faith, excuse the phrase. If this was supposed to be a story of magic, I may have been into it. But it was supposed to be a simple story of knowing yourself. And I think, philosophically speaking, when you truly know yourself that is when you truly realize your destiny. Why do you need supernatural forces to convey that message? This was about realizing your destiny, or ""personal legacy."" It could have been done without the hocus pocus, and, yes, the cheese. 

In short, the book attempted to be deep and failed. ""Speaking with the wind and the sun"" and ""being a shepherd"" and getting over ""personal hardship"" all as part of a transparent ""higher plan"" (read: personal legacy) doesn't make a plot deep. A character simply called ""boy"" and short sentences doesn't make a story a fable. Learning from your flocks and from nature doesn't make a character inexplicably wise. I really got nothing out of this book.

It is short though. The book came very highly recommended. Read it to judge the hype for yourself. After all, a whole nation, including Bill Clinton (who I'm into), thought it was a touching account that personally changed them. Then again, this is the same country who thought The Celestine Prophesy was worthwhile. Gag."
1393,‚òÖ Jess,Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone ,"Dec 10, 2009",5,"My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight. However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable. Honestly, its not even worth discussing. Its not just that Twilight doesn't come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It ""ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport."" 

There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.
I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all. 

Original review (circa 2010) 
A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate: 
Go ahed, tell me Twilight is better. 
Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort, 
That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's 
That Edward is cooler than Harry, 
and Bella is smarter than Hermione. 
Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J.K. Rowling. 

Go ahead, 
I dare you. 

Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over, 
are utterly stupid. 

Quite frankly-this book is amazing."

Inside me, there are two wolves. (I am saying there are two wolves in order to reference the meme, but what would be more accurate is to say that inside of me there are two boring and nonviolent creatures. Like a pigeon. Or an accountant.)

One wolf, or whatever, has such a constant and undying need to share its opinion that it is currently ranked #1 on Goodreads for most annoying best reviewer. (Don't check if that's still true. I doubt it'll stick and it'll be awkward for all of us if it isn't.)

The other wolf (slash what have you) thinks every other wolf (or entity of your choosing) has a better grasp of every concept on earth than it does, and that it should shut up for one second and let the other wolves talk, like seriously, Jesus Christ, be quiet already, oh my god.

The latter wolf wants to let you know that there is a very interesting conversation on the topic of this book, its categorization as a love story, and its history in the comments of this review, and you should scroll down to read that instead.

But the first wolf is going to keep talking up here anyway.

Here is a list of facts about this book:
- it was published in 1848
- its author had a grand total of about 1 year of formal education
- it was said author's debut and written while she was in her 20s
- it contains barbaric characters, total disregard for etiquette, necrophilia (or intent to commit), the devil embodied in a man (who is also the main love interest), The Royal Tenenbaums-style incest, premarital friskiness by 19th century standards, violence, emotional abuse, cruelty, and enough gaslighting to maybe make TikTokers consider for one second how often they use that word.

Kind of surprising, no?

In spite of the fact that I was told one hundred thousand million times that this is not a love story, I was told TWO hundred thousand million times that it was. And honestly I went in expecting something like Agnes Grey: it's not a satisfying romance, but there's something there.

I was not prepared for this.

This is a very intense and stunning and beautifully written novel, and if I ever reread it I think I will like it more then.

But no matter how hard I tried on this first read, my brain will always lump the Bront√´ sisters and Jane Austen together.

And this wasn't even Jane Eyre-level. It would have given Austen war flashback style nightmares.

Bottom line: We'll get em next time!

tbr review

confession time: i have now amassed 3 copies of this book, in the hope that one of them will suddenly inspire me to read it"
1396,Federico DN,Animal Farm,"Feb 24, 2014",5,"Equality.  

In the old Manor Farm, each animal puts their small effort to carry the farm forward; but when one day Mr. Jones farmer continuous abuse and neglect becomes unbearable, all the animals hold a special meeting to set a change. A revolutionary idea is born: Animals will govern themselves. Together they will bring a new age, where all animals are equal. But self-sufficiency and self-government carries heavy burdens, with small and big responsibilities for each animal; and soon small frictions begin to arise in the new haven. 

Another all time-classic by the legendary Orwell. No half stars deducted this time. This was a flawless 5-star masterpiece, if not six; because achieving SO much in SO few pages, is beyond reckoning. A timeless allegorical novella so powerful that it‚Äôs certain to give you pause, and most likely remember it for the rest of your life. So crucial for the time it was written, and still more than relevant today, and for the future yet to come. 

I remember being so wowed at the time I read this, my messed up country bearing so much resemblance to the events depicted in this book. It‚Äôs similarity still strong today, and not likely to change anytime soon. It‚Äôs a sad truth that some third world countries never managed to grow beyond their petty differences and troubled beginnings. 

I SO wanted to know more regarding the future of the farm; but I understand why and how it ended the way it did. Such an unforgettable thought provoking story, with lovable and hateful characters (view spoiler)[ (Snowball, Napoleon)  (hide spoiler)], and so heartbreaking. (view spoiler)[ the pain in my soul for Boxer still raw and unhealed.  (hide spoiler)] A must read in life. Extremely Recommendable.

*** Animal Farm (1954) is the best adaptation I‚Äôve seen so far, kinda old school by today standards but still an excellent cartoonish representation. Acceptable atmosphere, adequate pacing, and more than reasonably faithful to the book, if not completely. Yet, for some reason I couldn‚Äôt nearly enjoy it as much as the book, but can‚Äôt exactly pinpoint why; maybe the surprise was lost. A good film, just not great, for me.

*** Animal Farm (1999) is a somewhat controversial adaptation. Acceptable as a whole but far less faithful to the book, especially regarding the ending. A stellar voice casting including stars like Stewart, Louis-Dreyfus and Grammer, among others. The anthropomorphic representation with live animals giving it a certain unique touch the animated film didn‚Äôt have. 

I think either of the two films is worth watching, the first one for its grim fidelity and the second one for its more upbeat tone. Still, if I had to choose the 1954 version overall seemed better to me, and more memorable.

 Igualdad.  

En la vieja Granja Manor, cada animal pone su peque√±o esfuerzo para que la granja salga adelante; pero cuando un d√≠a los continuos abusos y descuidos del Sr. Jones se vuelven insoportables, todos los animales arman una reuni√≥n especial para crear un cambio. Nace una idea revolucionaria: Los Animales se gobernar√°n a s√≠ mismos. Juntos dar√°n inicio a una nueva era, donde todos los animales sean iguales. Pero la autosuficiencia y el autogobierno plantea dif√≠ciles tareas, con peque√±as y grandes responsabilidades para cada animal; y pronto algunas fisuras empiezan a aparecer en el nuevo reino.

Otro cl√°sico de todos los tiempos por el legendario Orwell. Ninguna media estrella deducida esta vez. Esta fue una impecable obra maestra de 5-estrellas, sino de seis; porque alcanzar TANTO en TAN pocas p√°ginas, es m√°s all√° de inimaginable. Una atemporal novela corta aleg√≥rica tan poderosa que es certero que te va a producir un quiebre, y m√°s que seguro para recordar por el resto de tu vida. Tan crucial para la √©poca en que fue escrita, y todav√≠a m√°s que relevante para los tiempos actuales, y el futuro todav√≠a por llegar.

Recuerdo haberme maravillado tanto el d√≠a que le√≠ esto, mi tan desgraciado pa√≠s teniendo tremendo parecido con los eventos reflejados en este libro. Su similitud todav√≠a patente el d√≠a de hoy, y dif√≠cilmente sujeto a cambiar pronto. Es una triste verdad que algunos pa√≠ses del tercer mundo nunca lograron crecer m√°s all√° de sus mezquinas diferencias y problem√°ticos comienzos. 

Realmente deseaba TANTO conocer m√°s acerca del futuro de la granja; pero entiendo por qu√© y c√≥mo termin√≥ como lo hizo. Una historia tan inolvidable y provocadora, con entra√±ables y odiosos personajes (view spoiler)[ (Bola de Nieve, Napole√≥n)  (hide spoiler)], y tan devastadora. (view spoiler)[ el dolor de mi alma por Boxer todav√≠a fresco y sin curar.  (hide spoiler)] Una obligaci√≥n de leer en la vida. Extremadamente Recomendable. 

*** Rebeli√≥n en la Granja (1954) es la mejor adaptaci√≥n que vi hasta ahora, un poco antigua para los est√°ndares de hoy pero aun as√≠ una excelente representaci√≥n animada. Atm√≥sfera aceptable, ritmo adecuado, y m√°s que razonablemente fiel al libro, sino completamente. Aun as√≠, por alguna raz√≥n no lo pude disfrutar ni de cerca tanto como el libro, pero no podr√≠a precisar exactamente por qu√©; tal vez se perdi√≥ la sorpresa. Un buen filme, s√≥lo que no genial, para m√≠.

*** Rebeli√≥n en la Granja (1999) es una algo controversial adaptaci√≥n. Aceptable en su conjunto, pero mucho menos fiel al libro, especialmente con respecto al final. Un electo estelar de voces incluyendo estrellas como Stewart, Louis-Dreyfus y Grammer, entre otros. La representaci√≥n antropom√≥rfica con animales reales d√°ndole un cierto toque √∫nico que pel√≠cula animada no tiene. 

Creo vale la pena ver cualquiera de los dos filmes, el primero por su sombr√≠a fidelidad y el segundo por tu tono m√°s alegre. Aunque si tuviera que elegir, creo que la versi√≥n de 1954 dentro de todo me pareci√≥ mejor, y m√°s memorable.

What a beautiful journey. What a beautiful family. What a beautiful story.
The book is so simple that every time after i complete it, i wonder whether i missed something. It leaves me wanting to know what led Alcott to write this simple masterpiece.

We have Jo ; a tomboy and an author who has a temper and a quick tongue, although she works hard to control both.


We have Meg ; responsible and kind, has a small weakness for luxury and leisure, but the greater part of her is gentle, loving, and morally vigorous.


We have Beth ; quiet and very virtuous, and she does nothing but try to please others.


We have Amy ; an artist who adores visual beauty and has a weakness for pretty possessions. 


We have Laurie ; charming, clever, and has a good heart.


This book is absolutely stunning in its simplicity. Alcott's writing is simple yet beautiful.

I started reading it at about 3pm in the afternoon and finished at about 9:30. When I finished I sat there, stunned. In awe. 

It is one of the best Young Adult novels I've ever read. One of the best novels I've ever read, if we're going to go there, too. It was, in a word, flawless.

1401,Brina,The Da Vinci Code ,"Jun 29, 2017",4,"Every summer I tend to enjoy reading action and adventure thrillers. The genre seems perfect for the hot weather outside as all of the action builds to a heated crescendo. Last week I participated in a diary called the Pepys Project in one of the groups I am part of, the reading for pleasure book club. The diarist relays pertinent literary information on a daily basis to ones peers. It happened that author Dan Brown celebrated a birthday last week, and as I had never read his best selling DaVinci Code, the diary reminded me that the summer was a good as time as any to partake in this thriller. 

World renowned Harvard professor Robert Langdon is in Paris to deliver a lecture about his latest findings in cryptic symbology. As Langdon addresses his speech, nearby at the Louvre museum an albino monk on orders from his teacher brutally murders curator Jacques Sauniere. These two events are not mere coincidence as Sauniere had been planning on meeting with Langdon later in the evening. As he lay dying, Sauniere penned cryptic codes to both Langdon and his granddaughter Sophie Neveu. It would be up to the pair to crack these mysteries before the church uncovered the secrets that Sauniere had worked his entire life to guard. 

Once Langdon and Neveu meet up, together they discover that Sauniere had been the grand master of the Priory of Sion, an ancient society which believed in an alternate true history of Christianity. Sauniere left the duo a trail of clues to find the true resting place of the holy grail, that is before Catholic fanatical sect Opus Dei beats them to it and destroys the information. Through a intricate web of surveillance and bribes, however, Paris of chief police Bezu Fache believes that Langdon and Neveu to be guilty of Sauniere's murder. Ensuing, is a race through Paris and London to ensure that the grail and its secrets do not fall into the wrong hands. 

Brown details centuries of religious symbols and information as he has Langdon and Neveu quest to keep the Priory's secrets safe. Along the way they meet a number of characters, never knowing if one is friend, foe, or double agent. As a result, the action is fast paced, intriguing, and even brain exercising as I thought alongside the pair to crack open the codes that Sauniere left for them. In a structure of short chapters and changing points of view, Brown created a story that grew more thrilling as it went on. This created for an entertaining denouement which read quickly to the end. 

While it remains to be seen if the mysteries outlined in The DaVinci Code are fact, fiction, or somewhere in between, Dan Brown has created a fun concept that makes for thrilling summer reading. The novel grew to be an international best seller and later made into a movie starring Tom Hanks. Even though movies are usually not as good as their novel counterparts, Brown's thriller should translate well onto screen as it is all action. The Pepys Project lead me to a summer reading adventure, which I rate 3.75 stars. I look forward to Dan Brown's next installment starring Robert Langdon."
1402,Will Byrnes,The Book Thief,"Jul 30, 2009",5,"The Book Thief was published as Young Adult novel. Don‚Äôt you believe it. This is a wonderful novel, appropriate for adults of young, middle and advanced years. My wife was shedding copious tears as she finished reading the book, and insisted that I read it immediately. How could I not? I was prepared for a moving read and was not disappointed. 


Sophie N√©lisse as Liesel Meminger - from TV Guide 

The main character is Liesel Meminger, just shy of ten years old when we first meet her. It is pre-WW II Germany. Her father has been transported for being a ‚ÄúKommunist.‚Äù While en route with her mother and brother, Werner, to be handed over to foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann, her brother dies. At his burial, she retrieves a book dropped by one of the gravediggers, a connection to her brother, and begins her career as a book thief. The Hubermanns live on Himmell (heaven) Street in the town of Molching, outside Munich. Rosa is a coarse, foul-mouthed woman. Hans is a warm, supportive papa. They come to form a very devoted, loving family. The story follows Liesel‚Äôs coming of age, meeting other children, particularly her bff Rudy, making friends, seeing reflected in the actions of her peers and the events that occur in the town the horrors of the age. But there is much more to this portrait of a German town than the bullies one expects to grow into the expected abusive stereotypes. There is hope, as well, for those who are dragged into the military against their wishes, for those who harbor fugitive Jews at great personal risk, for those who stand up against the abuse of the weak, for those who share a love of knowledge with those eager to learn. There is sadness, as some cannot live with what they have seen, what they have lost. 


Nico Liersch as Rudy Steiner - from Imglist.com

The Book Thief is populated with a klatch of wonderful characters. The spirited Liesel will win your heart, as will her friend Rudy, Hans and even Rosa. There are other characters who will also pluck those strings. You will be rooting for this one or that one, cheering victories and weeping at defeats. Having characters one comes to care for is the greatest strength of this book.

Over all is an appreciation for words, their power for both good and evil, the magic of language, books as a source of both damnation and salvation. Liesel steals her first book as a way of maintaining a connection with her dead brother. Later, learning to read and continuing to steal books gives her a feeling of power. The impact of Mein Kampf receives much attention as does book burning.


Geoffrey Rush as Hans Hubermann - from Aceshowbiz.com

Zusak uses an unlikely narrator for his tale, Death, who speaks to us as a reporter, an observer of events, not as someone who causes death, but as one who gently carries off the souls of those who have passed. While I have no problem with this device, and while I was charmed by the characterization, I was not convinced that it was entirely necessary. One could have just used a more usual third-party narrative to tell the tale. But it is a fun addition nonetheless. The film retained the narrator and did, IMHO, a pretty good job of capturing the essence of the book.


Emily Watson as Rossa Hubermann - from Hypable.com

Zusak takes a lot of stylistic chances here, from his selection of a narrator to the incorporation of a few illustrated tales within the larger whole. They did not all work, but most did, and I appreciated his willingness to draw outside the lines. 


Mark Zusak

The Book Thief accomplishes a very lofty goal. It is both intellectually and artistically daring and satisfying while offering up an emotional punch second to none. It will stimulate your brain and it will, at the same time, steal your heart."
1403,Margaret M - (Working Away - limited time with lots to catch up already,Jane Eyre,"Jan 04, 2023",5,"If there is such a thing as the perfect book. For me ‚ÄòJane Eyre‚Äô would define it.

5 ‚ú® brooding, uncompromising, passionate, but tormenting stars, for my favourite book of all time. I love this book for the way it depicts the strength of the human spirit, the importance of being yourself, the rights of women, and the explicit yet beautiful way the story is told. Dramatic, uninhibited, and evocative. 

Jane Eyre is best known or described as a ‚Äògothic love story‚Äô but for me it is so much more. It is an emotional life story that contrasts the extremities of love and hate, where the principled and incorruptible mind battles the unscrupulous and most brutal of beasts and rules. Jane Eyre is an unapologetic feminist story, like no other. It is an emotional story where one woman‚Äôs soul was forever tormented by the people she tried to love and cursed by those who did not deserve to own nor judge her. However, the standout is the rawness in which the author expresses Jane‚Äôs feelings of love, hurt, and anguish, and the many themes it embraces particularly for its time. 

A burning question is ‚Äòwhy do I love this book so much?‚Äô The storyline? the love story? the many themes it embraces? or is it Jane Eyre, the character I love the most? All will be revealed, but first the plot.

The Plot

The story begins with Jane, orphaned after the death of her parents and further isolated when her uncle dies leaving her in the hands of his heartless family. After an unpleasant and bloody exchange with her cousin, and then aunt, Jane is sent to Lowood. A charitable but educational institution.

It is at this point in the book that we get an early insight into the character of the 10-year-old Jane, her principles and unwavering determination to speak up for what is right and just, when she admonishes her aunt 

‚ÄúI am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed‚Ä¶.. ‚ÄúHow dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth. You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity‚Ä¶. you are bad, hard-hearted. You are deceitful!‚Äù.

Jane‚Äôs early battle with life‚Äôs cruel reality was to continue with the death of a beautiful and kind pupil Helen, but her resolve saw her through 8 years at Lowood at which point and now educated, she applies to Thornfield Hall for the position of governess. The home that is to become hers after falling in love with its master, Edward Rochester. Yet lady fate was to have her day again when Jane discovers in the most humiliating wedding scene that Rochester‚Äôs wife still lives, but insane.

After one of the most touching exchanges between these two very different lovers. The characters of Jane and Rochester are laid bare; their passions, principles, and virtues are exposed for us to savour and appraise. He a brooding and selfish man asks Jane to live on as his mistress, while Jane‚Äôs honour prevents her from embracing such an immoral life, which would be contrary to her principles. She wants more for herself, not driven by ambition but by virtue and the right to think and love freely.

Fleeing Thornfield Hall, Jane finds solace in the sequestered Moor home, with St John and his sisters. St John, a devoutly religious man also seeks Jane‚Äôs affections and help as a missionary, but not love. Once again we hear the painful and agonising words from Jane, that can only but leave an imprint on the mind and the heart of the reader‚Ä¶

‚ÄúDo you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! ‚Äî I have as much soul as you ‚Äî and full as much heart‚Äù

And yes, she does. Jane Eyre is one of the most fascinating characters in fictional history, and if you don‚Äôt love the book, you will at least love this character.

Review and Comments

This is my sixth time reading Jane Eyre (although twice at school) and every time I read it, I get something different from the story. However, this is the first time reviewing and the first time I have challenged myself to explaining why this story means so much to me, apart from it being the first classic book I ever fell in love with, which will always have its rightful place in my book history. No film adaption has done it justice and no words that I write can capture the beauty that lies within these pages. Of course, I can write words, so inspiring is this book, but cannot express how I truly feel with this book the way Charlotte Bronte can write with such rawness. I also need to restrict myself to covering the key themes and elements otherwise I would be writing a book about a book. So first up is the character development. 

‚ÄòJane Eyre‚Äô sets the bar in character development and is one of the best I have ever read for this. There is nothing left to the imagination and the explicit way emotions and feelings are portrayed is remarkable, sentimental but also appropriate. The character traits of the two key male characters, Rochester and St John are evocative and ignite frustration and even slight anger in the reader. One man would turn his back on the laws of God and society for the love of the young Jane, whilst the other obsessive and devout has expectations of self-sacrifice for God, his own vanity and ambition. 

Whilst different, both men possess the same unwavering sense of entitlement, and lack humility and understanding when they offer Jane a life contrary to her beliefs, honour, and feelings. St John says to her

‚Äú‚Ä¶ you are formed for labour, not for love. A missionary‚Äôs wife you must‚Äîshall be. You shall be mine: I claim you‚Äînot for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign‚Äôs service.‚Äù 

While Rochester‚Äôs disregard of what Jane represents is equally as distasteful, he does draw sympathy from the reader because there are displays of kindness towards others and his love for Jane is unquestionable if not selfish. Once again it is Jane‚Äôs response that ignited a wave of emotions in me 

‚ÄúLaws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour‚Äù 

Feminism, Religion, and Class are constant themes through the novel where the eponymous Jane tells her own story. If you consider the period in which this book was written; the content and storyline, the uninhibited expressions of love and anger as well as the uncensored view of feminism, then you can begin to appreciate just how incredibly provocative this book might have been for the times. On many occasions, Jane describes herself as someone‚Äôs ‚Äòequal‚Äô not to be caged in a social class nor defined by society‚Äôs expectation of the role of women. It is this freedom of expression, independence of mind, and moral commitment that consumed me so much in this story.

‚ÄúI am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.‚Äù 

At this point I reveal that the reason I love this book so much is because of Jane Eyre‚Äôs character. It is the most extraordinary story about an ordinary young woman, although a heroine in my eyes. A woman guided by honour, influenced, and dedicated but not cosseted by religion. An independent woman who is highly principled and determined yet loving and generous, and passionate but not vindicative. A young woman who wants to live, love, and think freely, and in that lies the beauty of this book. How groundbreaking, daring, and courageous from the incredibly gifted Charlotte Bronte. 

Second to that is the uninhibited depiction of the characters, their emotions, and the inner battles they must conquer in the face of temptation. All of this of course is brought to life with Bronte's perfectly chosen words, vivid descriptions and unbridled but elegant prose. There is such a rawness to the writing, although some would say overly dramatic but for me it is another beautiful and remarkable aspect to this book, because it works.

Jane Eyre is a book that is bold for the way it inspires feminism, courageous in the way it challenges the accepted norms of society and religion but is also respectful. There is beauty in the storytelling, sincerity in these righteous but flawed characters, and artistry in the way the themes have been woven into the story ‚Äì an epic masterpiece in literature. 

‚ÄúI have for the first time found what I can truly love‚ÄîI have found you. You are my sympathy‚Äîmy better self‚Äî my good angel.‚Äù Says Rochester.

And my GR friends, I too have found (in books) what I truly love, and it is this timeless classic that is likely to remain as my #1 book of all time, for all time. In the dawn of a new year in books, what better way to have started my new reading year than with Jane Eyre, the principled, loving feminist, and her story.

I just finished 'Wide Sargasso Sea' by Jean Rhys, a prequel or retelling of sorts that I would highly recommend for readers and lovers of Jane Eyre. It is an accompaniment to Jane Eyre and provides some context to the events leading up to and the marriage of Bertha to Rochester, which Jane Eyre does not explore in any depth. Haunting, vividly depicted and a lens on Bertha that is somewhat different to the image created by Rochester. Fabulous."

1407,Emily May,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,"Dec 05, 2010",3,"I am not one of those who think this is the best book ever written. It does not affect me on any deep emotional level and this kind of quirky sci-fi comedy is just not really my thing. However, that being said, Adams' has some of the best quotes EVER (not all of these are from this exact book):


""In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."" 



""For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much‚Äîthe wheel, New York, wars and so on‚Äîwhilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man‚Äîfor precisely the same reasons.""



""The Guide says there is an art to flying"", said Ford, ""or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.""



""A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools."" 



""Would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?"" 



""The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't."""
1408,Kristi  Siegel,The Help,"Mar 15, 2010",2,"The Kindle DX I ordered is galloping to the rescue today... 



AND, for all the book purists (which would include me), this is a need, rather than a want. Post-several eye surgeries, I'm just plain sick of struggling to read the words on a page.

However, despite the visual challenges, I read all 451 pages of The Help yesterday. Clearly, the book held my interest. However, I spent last night pondering why the book wasn't as good as my nonstop reading would indicate.

What was wrong? 

Most of all, I think it was the book's ambivalent tone. In brief, a white woman, Miss Skeeter Phelan--one of Jackson, Mississippi's socially elite--convinces a number of the African-American maids to tell her their story. What goes on in the homes of the upper crust? How do these women really treat their maids? 

Though the book would be published anonymously and no locations would be given, the stories provide enough detail so that the premise (that the book could be received as being about Anywhere, USA) defies belief. Further, while having the book's source known might subject Skeeter to social ostracism, this is the 1960s in Missa-fuckin-sippi in the middle of the very tense civil rights' battles. For the maids, discovery would mean loss of a job (with no hope of getting another position) and retribution that could include being falsely accused of a crime (and jailed) or even being injured or killed.

Despite the underlying tension and references to violent events that do occur, the book teeters. At times, I was furious and in tears over the effing racism and the tragedies described. But Kathryn Stockett keeps pulling back. It's as though she wants it both ways. Let's divulge the incredible cruelty and violence that black people routinely endured, but let's also show the goodness of some white people and soft-pedal the whole thing into a broader theme, i.e., how difficult it is for two women in any unequal power situation to be ""friends.""

Nope. Sorry. You can't have it both ways. Though some of the women are kinder to their maids, they did not fight against the ""separate but equal"" indignities that included building a ""nigra"" toilet in their home or garage so that the maids' ""nasty"" germs would not infect them, the separate entrances, the substandard schools, the ""justice"" system that made a white accusation the same as proof, and on and on and on.

I don't want a book to make me cry and then pull back and say, ""It's all right."" It's not all right. 

If you're going to write a book about this horrible time in our history - and in a country where racism is still alive and well - then do it all out. What these women endured deserves more. Don't put it out there and then pull back and use a Doris Day lens. 

It doesn't work."

1412,Lyn,Brave New World,"Nov 13, 2011",5,"This set the stage about what a dystopian story should be or not be. 

‚ÄúBut I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.‚Äù

First published in 1932, this is timeless and is as relevant today as when it was first written. Sixteen years before Orwell's 1984 but eleven years after We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, this is a high water mark for the genre, many of its themes could be told today. Truth be said, this could be published today and would be just as good, it rises to the challenge and then towers above it.

‚ÄúIf one's different, one's bound to be lonely.‚Äù

Everyday life makes me think of this book all the time. Huxley does more than describe a bleak and cynical post-apocalyptic or dystopian world, he looks a dystopian resident in the eye and puts before him a mirror to flesh out what is real and unreal. Further, Huxley has turned that same mirror on the reader and we see in his far future fantasy a reality that could be today. Huxley reveals that the seeds of Mustafa Mond and his ilk have fertile ground in our culture and in our souls.

‚ÄúNo social stability without individual stability.‚Äù

Finally, Huxely provides a glimpse behind the curtain, we see the false wizard in his machinations. The world that has been crafted for the denizens of Huxley's nightmare landscape is explained fully and matter-of-factly by Mond. Huxley's sermon is delivered as stoically and deterministically as Jonathon Edwards ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"".

""You all remember, I suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of Our Ford's: History is bunk.""

A must read.

*** 2020 Re-read:

Reading this brilliant work after a few years only just reminded me of not only what an exceptional book it is, but of also how important it is in literature.

‚ÄúIn 1999, the Modern Library ranked Brave New World as #5 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, Robert McCrum, writing for The Observer, included Brave New World chronologically at #53 in ""the top 100 greatest novels of all time"", and the novel was listed at #87 on The Big Read survey by the BBC.‚Äù
-	Wikipedia

Huxley was greatly affected and influenced by economic events in the England of the 1920s and of the need for stability, but at what cost? A trip to America and an exploration of Henry Ford‚Äôs autobiography My Life and Work further led him towards the centralized and industrialized world that he created in BNW.

Huxley, perhaps more so than Orwell, has crafted a domain wherein the individual has succumbed to the will of the state. But Huxley‚Äôs vision is more subtle and therefore more insidious ‚Äì the citizens of Huxley‚Äôs dystopia are brainwashed and seem genuinely happy. The dehumanizing automation of births and families as well as the somnambulist / hypnotic effects of Soma further create a scenario where out traditional attitudes of right and wring have been displaced.

Most of all in this reading is the characterization of John and of his juxtaposition with him as a product of the savage reservation and of his alienation in the London of the brave new world. In John, Huxley has created a shadow of Miranda from The Tempest, and the civilization he finds is one that he ultimately rejects in favor of the most extreme form of individual choice.

Timeless and important."

1416,Zannachan,The Book Thief,"Jan 11, 2008",1,"I had a hardcover of this book. I no longer have it. I did not even finish reading it, because it irritated me so much and when I asked if it got better no one could convince me that it was worth persevering. 

I know that there are many people who love this book, authors who's book I love, readers who's tastes I respect. But I couldn't stand the narrator. Every time the Narrator intruded on the story it felt like exactly that--an intrusion. A lot of people really like the narrator, and I imagine if you did the book would be much more enjoyable to read. As it was I found the writing style consciously ""artistic"" or ""literary"" while the characters felt fake, superficial, and mechanical. I was too aware of the mechanics of the story and how he was manipulating the reader--kind of like going to a puppet show and having the puppeteer continually slipping and letting himself be seen. It kept knocking me out of the story.

Holocaust fiction is hard for me to read anyway, because it's an incredibly difficult period of history and human experience to read about. For me to want to read Holocaust fiction, it had better be better than okay, or even good--ti had better be absolutely amazing for me to be willing to put myself through the emotional pain and struggles that are inherent with a holocaust book. Real life is hard enough for me to get upset and stressed out by a mediocre book.

And please don't take that to mean that I only read books that are light and fluffy and safe, because I do read books that are hard, that are sad. But while some people same to take pleasure in reading a book just because it is sad (""Oh, this is a wonderful book! It made me cry!""), I don't enjoy crying in and of itself. For me to read a book that is heart wrenching, it had better offer me something besides an emotional train wreck--powerful characters I really care about, an engrossing story line, some new observation on human existence and human relations,  something. 

I do not usually read fiction to ""learn,"" per se--that is, if I wanted to learn more about the Holocaust, I'd read non-fiction accounts. I have read non-fiction accounts. I have read a few things of Holocaust fiction as well, and I have read some scholarly work as well. So it doesn't sell me on the book that it is a painful story, that it shows that some Germans were good and how social pressures created the Holocaust. I needed it to be a book about people that really interested me, that I cared about, and instead I was bored with the characters and irritated at the narrator and the obvious manipulations of the author. Instead of getting wrapped into the story, every night I when I was reading it I'd throw it down and vent for a half an hour to my husband about something that annoyed me. After a few nights of this, I realized that unless someone could convince me that the second half of the book was much better than the first that it just wasn't worth my time to finish.

'm not saying it's a bad book. So many people wouldn't love it if it were  bad.  But it really did not work for me."
1417,Shana,The Catcher in the Rye,"Dec 26, 2007",1,"I read this book for the first time in the 8th grade. I had to get my mom to sign a permission slip because of the cursing. Before I began reading, I had so many expectations. Back then, I read Seventeen Magazine, and back then, Seventeen Magazine ran brainy features about books and poetry. There was one feature where they asked people what book changed their lives, and something like more than half said Catcher in the Rye. I think there might have been some celebrity comments in there, too. At any rate, it was a ringing endorsement.

So you can imagine my disappointment when I hated it. Not only did I hate Holden, but I hated everything about the novel. There was nothing I enjoyed. I did my book report where I confessed my hatred (which led my teacher to confess that she did, too), but I couldn't let it go. I honestly felt that my loathing of a novel that so many others found ""life-changing"" indicated some deep and horrible flaw. I felt like hating Catcher in the Rye was my dirty little secret.

Time passed, and my self-loathing mellowed. I began to think that perhaps I'd come at it too young, so after my first year of college, I decided to re-read it, go at it with fresh eyes, and see if my opinion had changed.

Here's the thing: it hasn't. I get it. I get that Holden is supposed to be loathsome. I get that he is the hypocrite he hates. I get that almost all teenagers go through the kind of thinking he experiences. I get it. I do. I just don't like it.

Oh, and I'm not ashamed anymore."

*One of the many quaint and highly amusing Southernisms used in the book

WHY READ THIS 1,037-PAGE BOOK IN THE FIRST PLACE?
I‚Äôd seen the film several times, and had always wanted to read the novel, if only to compare the two. Also: it won the Pulitzer Prize ‚Äì so it had to have literary merit, right? And many people whose tastes I respect on this site love it. Then, while perusing my local library, I saw a brand new hardcover copy of the 75th anniversary edition, and that was my sign. I thought: As God is my witness, now is the time to read it. And read it. And keep on reading it. I renewed it several times. It took me well over a month to get through (albeit during a super busy time at work). But like Scarlett clawing her way back to Tara after the war, I persevered. And I'm so glad I did.

A GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL 
There‚Äôs everything in here. Immigration. Slavery. A brutal war and its aftermath. A moving romance. An examination of ethics and morality. There are big themes like money vs. love, passion vs. friendship, the old world vs. the new. And at its centre is one of the most complex characters in all of literature, Scarlett O‚ÄôHara. 

OH, SCARLETT
She‚Äôs vain. Selfish. Petty. Culturally ignorant. She‚Äôs a terrible, terrible mother (the film only shows her with one child, Bonnie, but she has two other children from different husbands, and barely pays them any attention). She is deluded about her beloved golden boy Ashley Wilkes (at times the book reads like an Old South take on He‚Äôs Just Not That Into You) and doesn‚Äôt appreciate Ashley‚Äôs wife, Melanie, until the end. BUT: Margaret Mitchell makes us root for her. She‚Äôs a survivor. She‚Äôs a hard worker. She‚Äôs street smart. And ultimately, even though she complains while doing it, she helps her family. She doesn‚Äôt care about social niceties or appearances (unless they can help her); they won‚Äôt feed and clothe her and her brood. Her eye‚Äôs always on the bottom line. And if something‚Äôs not working out, she‚Äôll ignore it and think about it tomorrow. She‚Äôll find a solution. What. A. Character.

RHETT
Swarthy, muscular, tanned, hairy, interested in fashion, well-travelled, super well-educated even though he was kicked out of West Point, Rhett Butler is a bit of a romance novel wish fulfillment type. And he always seems steps ahead of everyone else. But the dashing, enterprising blockade-runner is one helluva romantic lead. The evolution of his relationship with Scarlett is so carefully and artfully structured that the final 100 pages will make your heart ache. And what Mitchell got away from censors ‚Äì the love-making on the night of Ashley‚Äôs surprise birthday party is pretty much rape ‚Äì is incredible. 

A CAVEAT 
Reading this book in 2018 is often an uncomfortable experience because of the treatment of the African-American characters. The N-word and the euphemism ‚Äúdarkie‚Äù are all over the place. Few of the Black characters are given any agency or dignity, except Scarlett‚Äôs Mammy, and even she is often described in animal terms - compared to an old ape. There's a strange disconnect, too. Often the Blacks are described as lazy and loafing. And yet, Mitchell frequently has her characters working ""as hard as a field hand."" So who was lazy? Worse, in sections that are supposed to be written in some objective third-person narration (they provide lots of fascinating information, to be fair), Mitchell clearly sides with the Confederates. One chapter in particular, 37, was extremely difficult to read; it‚Äôs pure propaganda. 

THE CIVIL WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION 
As a Canadian, I didn‚Äôt have to study the war in school, and what I know about it has been cobbled together from bits and pieces. The way Mitchell interweaves the war into the narrative is incredible. You see it from a macro and micro perspective. I‚Äôm very curious now and want to read other books, both fiction and non, about it.

THE MOVIE 
I plan on rewatching the film in the next month or so, but I wanted the book to settle in first. Here‚Äôs what I remember about the differences: Besides leaving out Scarlett‚Äôs other two children, we don‚Äôt get Archie, an ex-convict taken in by Melanie, who becomes Scarlett‚Äôs driver for a time, and Will Benteen, a simple but hard-working man who helps run Tara while Scarlett‚Äôs away, but you can see why the filmmakers excluded them. One of the best minor characters is Grandma Fontaine, an embittered old woman whom everyone (including Scarlett) fears. She digs the truth out of Scarlett in a scene that is seared into my brain it‚Äôs so powerful. I also don‚Äôt recall anything about the Ku Klux Klan, and that Ashley and Scarlett‚Äôs second husband, Frank Kennedy, are part of it. Good call, filmmakers! Rhett‚Äôs determination that Bonnie be accepted by good society is much more pronounced than it was in the movie. And it‚Äôs interesting that Scarlett‚Äôs aristocratic mother, Ellen, was in love with someone else but married her husband, Gerald, in the same way that Scarlett, in love with Ashley, did with husbands 1, 2 and 3. That‚Äôs not in the movie, but it adds so much texture to the book, and makes you see patterns in human behaviour. (Also: Scarlett‚Äôs daughter, Bonnie, has inherited Scarlett‚Äôs and Gerald‚Äôs stubbornness.) And the book also features a fascinating motif of Scarlett having nightmares that is ingeniously integrated into the climax. That couldn't be done in the movie. 

SUMMARY 
A flawed masterpiece about a flawed character and a flawed country that‚Äôs still, in some ways, dealing with the effects of this chapter in its history. The book features one of the most unforgettable characters and romances in the canon. I can‚Äôt give it anything less than 5 stars."
1419,Chris,The Princess Bride,"Jan 31, 2008",5,"If you haven't read this book, then all I can tell you is to go out, get it, and read it. Now. Don't bother with the rest of this review, you'll thank me later. It has:

For a start.

It's one of the greatest love/action/revenge stories ever abridged by a modern author. Well, it seems that Mr. Goldman felt that the original story, as written by the immortal S. Morganstern, was a little too dry for public consumption, as well as damaging to treasured childhood memories, so he went through it and put together this ""good parts"" version, and the world is a better place for it. [1:]

Of course, the big gag is that there never was an original version of the book. There never was an S. Morganstern, the greatest of the Florinese writers. Goldman's father may have read books to him as a child, but he never read this book to him. The entire thing is a fiction, beginning to end, but Goldman sells it really well. He tells the tale of how he blossomed as a boy - going from being a sports-obsessed disappointment to a ravenous bookworm, all thanks to this book. He talks about trying to give the same gift to his son, who manages to make it through one chapter before giving up in exhaustion. He talks about the great shock of discovering that his father had done something utterly brilliant - he had skipped the dull bits and left the exciting parts intact.

Knowing that all of this is false certainly doesn't detract from the story. It's a story about a story, and the effect that a story can have on a young mind. Or any mind, for that matter. It's about how stories can teach us lessons that only later we understand - such as how life is not fair - and how stories can change us in ways that we never expected. It's about our relationship with fiction, and with the world around us. In his fictional childhood, Goldman learned more about the world from the process of watching the story unfold than he did from the story itself. And so this book is a story about stories. The actual story is just bonus.

Which brings me, of course, to the film. Let me say that this is one of the very, very few instances where I will put the movie up on par with the book. 99.9999 repeating percent of the time, the book is better than the movie. This is one instance where they are equal in nearly every measure. I'm sure a lot of this has to do with the fact that Goldman wrote the screenplay for the film, so not only is the story intact, but a great deal of the dialogue is almost verbatim from the book. It was gold in print and gold on the screen. The hardest part about reading the book is trying not to hear Andre the Giant, Christopher Guest, Robin Wright and all the other fine actors and actresses in your head as you read.

So, whether you read the book or see the movie, you're in for a treat. And as you read, just remember the books that molded you into who you are today. Think about the stories that taught you life's lessons before life got around to doing it. Think about them and appreciate them, and remember that every book is a lesson, one way or another....

[1:] This is a fun type of meta-fiction, writers writing autobiographically about writing about books that never existed. I find it interesting that The Princess Bride can sit comfortably shoulder-to-shoulder with House of Leaves."
1420,Manny,Litli prinsinn,"Jul 24, 2018",5,"[Original review, Jul 24 2018]

This month, three plotlines in my life collided. I know Swedish and Norwegian well, and I'd thought vaguely from time to time that I'd like to learn Icelandic too; I've always been a great admirer of Tolkien, and I knew he had been interested in Icelandic; and I have a couple of Icelandic friends. But none of this had ever come to anything. Last week, however, Jupiter aligned with Mars and I entered the Age of Aquarius. I'd just finished reading 
Tolkien: Maker of Middle-Earth
, which has many striking passages in Icelandic, Old Norse and Old English, and our friend K happened to be on Iceland. Fired with enthusiasm by Tolkien's love of these obscure but wonderfully poetic languages, I asked K if she could possibly get me one or two Icelandic children's books. I just don't know how to thank her: she turned up with not one or two but half a dozen books, including my favorite, Le petit prince. I spent the next few days carrying it with me everywhere, snatching all opportunities to try to make sense out of it.

For people who don't know anything about Icelandic, it has the same ancestor as Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. A thousand years ago they were the same language. But the mainland languages have evolved at a normal rate, while Icelandic, on its faraway island, has changed relatively little; so if you speak Swedish or Norwegian, it's like trying to read a language which for an English-speaker would be somewhere between Chaucer and Beowulf. You recognise a few of the words at once, others are more or less mangled, and still others are completely unfamiliar. The first impression is that it makes no sense at all. But I know Le petit prince, and I started trying to guess what word was what, just reading without looking anything up.

It was amazing to see how well this worked. For example, let me show you the following sentence:√ûar sem √©g haf√∞i adrei teikna√∞ kind dr√≥ √©g upp fyrir hann a√∞ra af √æeim tveimur myndum sem √©g var f√¶r a√∞ gera: myndina af kyrkisl√∂ngunni utanver√∞i.The first time I saw this, there were only a couple of words I felt at all sure about. Upp and var must be the same words as in Swedish (""up"" and ""was""). I soon figured out that √©g was ""I"" (it is the same word in some Norwegian dialects), a√∞ was att (""that""), and hann was han (""he/him""). The words mynd and kind weren't like anything I recognised, but they were common, and having already come across them I realised they must be ""drawing"" and ""sheep"". As I read the book for the second time, the other words gradually fell into place too, and after a while I could read it as sort-of-Swedish:D√• som jag hadde aldrig tecknad f√•r drog jag upp f√∂r honom den-andra av dem tv√• teckningarna som jag var f√∂r att g√∂ra: teckningen av pytonormen utifr√•n.which I might render into sort-of-English as:Then as I had never drawn sheep pulled I up for him the-second of the two drawings which I was able-to make: the-drawing of the-python from-outside.I recalled that there was a sentence something like this near the beginning of the story: it all made sense.

How does it work? I've been reading deep learning theory, and it's tempting to conceptualise it in terms of strengthening of neural pathways. I see a word I don't know, and I think of some words it could be: a√∞ra to a Swedish-speaker first looks like √•dra, ""vein"", and you only later think of andra, ""second"". This word occurs quite often. ""Vein"" never makes any sense, but ""second"" often makes good sense. So the pathway for √•dra never gets strengthened but the one for andra does, and after a while my eyes just start seeing it as andra. The same thing happened with numerous other words. As I'm sure many language geeks will attest, it is such a weird and interesting feeling to find the sense emerging from words which initially looked like gibberish! I'm sorry if I've gone into too much detail here, but I wanted to explain what I mean when I say it's like doing drugs. You actually feel the text changing your state of consciousness.

Well, I'm hooked. Though so far, I've just barely started: the grammar is still a mystery to me. All the same, on my latest read-through I notice that the endings of nouns and verbs, which are first looked quite random, now seem to be displaying some recurrent patterns...

[Update, Aug 6 2018]

I have been making efforts to understand in more quantitative terms what I've been doing here. First, I thought it would be a good exercise to try copying out the text of Litli prinsinn: this would force me to look carefully at every letter, and also give me a machine-readable version that I could analyse. I'm now about three-quarters of the way through (he has just said goodbye to the fox). I tried running my incomplete corpus, which contains about ten thousand words, through a script that Not and I developed last year.

The script is simple but quite useful. It counts frequencies for all the words in the corpus, then builds a hyperlinked concordance which shows me up to ten examples for each word. Every word is clickable, so I can take a word I'm unsure of in a sentence and see examples of that word in other contexts. There is a master index which lists all the words in descending frequency order. Here are the first 50 lines. The 'Freq' column gives the number of times the word occurs, and the 'Cumul' column gives the cumulative frequency:




All of these 50 words (to be exact, some of them are punctuation marks) are now very familiar to me, and as you can see they make up more than 50% of the text. I tried walking down the list to see when I stopped feeling confident. I can go as far as words with four or five occurrences, and I think I know what nearly all of them mean; that brings me up to about 400 words, and 75% of the total. When I look at words occurring two or three times, I start to feel uncertain, but I still think I know the majority of them. That gets me to 900 words and 86%. The 1600 words which only occur once are of course the hardest; but even here I feel I can guess a lot, perhaps a third to a half of them.

Copying out the text has sharpened my understanding of the grammar a good deal, and now I recognise quite a few endings. Though I'm still pretty hazy about the nouns. With multiple genders, multiple cases and marking for definiteness, there are many combinations, and I only know the most common ones. 

It's surprising that one can extract so much information from a tiny sample of just ten thousand words. I'll see if I have the patience to finish this and then do √Üvint√Ωri L√≠su √≠ Undralandi as well...
___________________________________
[Update, Aug 8 2018]

I have finished copying out the text of Litli prins; the file now contains about 14,200 words and about 3,050 unique words. I made a small improvement to our script, so that it now creates an alphabetical index as well. This is very useful for finding copying errors: if I see two words close together which are almost the same, that often means that one of them is an error. Tidying up my copied text is not as tedious as I thought it would be. It's forcing me to look very carefully at everything and consolidate my extremely sketchy vocabulary.

I am sure there are still many errors left, but after this initial cleaning up pass I can look at my alphabetical index and get further on trying to understand the grammar. Here's a section showing forms of the word stjarna, ""star"", which occurs often in Litli prins.



Some of these are compound nouns: for example, stj√∂rnufr√¶√∞ingur, literally ""star-ologist"" is ""astronomer"", and stjarnfr√¶√∞i√æingi, ""star-ology-thing"" is ""astronomical congress"". But what are all the others, most of which look like inflected forms? I can click on any of them and get a hyperlinked page of examples. For example, let's look at the page for stj√∂rnu, which occurs 15 times:



I see that occurrences of stj√∂rnu usually come after a preposition. For example, we have Hann hefir aldrei horft √° stj√∂rnu, ""He has never looked at stj√∂rnu"", or En √æ√∫ ert hreinn og √æ√∫ kemur fr√° stj√∂rnu, ""But you are pure and you come from stj√∂rnu"". Most of the others are similar. Hm, looks like this is a dative singular? My suspicions are reinforced by the fact that Swedish used to have a dative; it disappeared long ago, but still survives in a couple of fixed expressions like till salu, ""for sale"", which has this -u ending. 

Still a great deal more grammar to figure out! There are some improvements to the script that I hope to add soon, and which might help...
___________________________________
[Update, Aug 12 2018]

I have added another little improvement to our script. It now creates a hyperlinked version of the original text, with the words colour-marked to show how frequently they occurred in the text you've read so far. The initial version uses four colours. Words are in black if they occur more than five times, blue if they occur four or five times, green if they occur two or three times, and red if they occur once. Here's an example, the start of the visit to the Drunkard:



The colours let you see at a glance approximately how well I now understand the text. Look at the first paragraph:√Å √æri√∞ja hnettinum bj√≥ drykkjuma√∞ur. Heims√≥knin √æanga√∞ var mj√∂g stutt, en h√∫n fyllti litla prinsinn miklu √æunglyndi.

(At the-third planet lived drunkard. The-visit there was very ?short, but it filled the-little prince much ?depression)Black words like hnettinum (""planet"", I think in the dative) and mj√∂g (""very"") are quite familiar, and I am reasonably confident that I've guessed the green and blue ones correctly. Only two words, stutt (""short""?) and √æunglyndi (""depression""?) are in red, and these are indeed the ones I feel least certain about. I'm pretty much guessing stutt from context. I'm more confident about √æunglyndi, since I know from other examples that √æung, cognate to Swedish tung, is ""heavy"", lyndi is probably something related to Swedish lynne, ""spirit"", and there is a Swedish word tungsint, ""heavy-spirited/depressed"".

This was an easier passage than average, and usually there is more red. But it feels motivating to think that, as I copy out more text and process it through the script, the red tide should start to recede...

Happy shows of course, no others will penetrate the dreams of the ladies, reality is not fun . Yet doubts come when a nearly 17 -year- old curious girl, a next door neighbor, starts asking Guy Montag, many uncomfortable questions, Clarisse McClellan admits she's crazy. In the firehouse, Montag spends most of his time playing cards with the fellows, strangely in the future, no women are employed in that noble profession. But plenty of cigarette smoking, they are real firemen . Captain Beatty starts getting suspicious of Montag, the mechanical pet dog, also, it likes killing rats, the four legged kind I mean, and hates our great hero. War is in the air , jet bombers are flying around the skies in circles, atomic bombs threaten to rain down and annihilate the so- called civilization . Not to worry; get back to the TV walls, people and forget. Clarisse mysterious disappears, one ordinary day, she's here, then .... gone...Finally the forbidden fruit's temptation, becomes quite unbearable , and Montag arriving in a house full of illegal , but strangely attractive books, takes a sample. Big horrendous mistake, worse, the owner, an old woman, refuses to leave her place and goes literally up in flames with her beloved ""friends"". Everyone says it was a shame , but her own fault; no tears should be shed. Afterwards an incident occurs and Guy has to flee for his own life, the relentless mechanical dog is on the hunt. The petrified Montag jumps into the cold river and peacefully, gently floats down the beautiful stream. Getting out soon after , he sees a fire above, with a group of ""Hobos"" near the water . Is that a flash in the sky ? This warning of a maybe world, in the years to come , is still relevant today , though so much time has passed. SCIENCE FICTION makes for an interesting atmosphere, anything is possible and Bradbury's poetic words dazzle the mind."
1423,Silvana,1984,"Dec 07, 2007",5,"WAR IS PEACE.

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.

Those words keep sounding in my head since I read this book. Gosh, probably the most haunting not to mention frightening book I've ever read. 1984 should also be included in the horror genre.

1984 describes a Utopia. Not Thomas More's version of Utopia, but this is one is the antithesis, i.e. Dystopia. Imagine living in a country, whose leaders apply a totalitarian system in regulating their citizen, in the most extreme ways, which make Hitler, Mao, Stalin and that old bloke in V for Vendetta look like sissies.

Working, eating, drinking, sleeping, talking, thinking, procreating...in short living, all are controlled by the state. Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police, telescreen, or even your children, who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities. Even language is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself, since individualism is a crime.

The past is controlled, rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler. Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. There is no real truth. The ""truth"" is what the state says it is. Black is white, 2+2=5, if the state says so.

The world in 1984 is divided into three states, originated from the ashes from World War II: Oceania (British Isles, the Americas, Pacific, Australia), Eurasia (Europe & Russia), and Eastasia (the rest of it). Continuous warfare between those three (who hold similar ideologies) is required to keep the society's order and peace. Si vis pacem para bellum. That's describes the first slogan.

The second slogan, freedom is slavery, means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party. That way, you'll be indestructible and immortal.

Ignorance is strength, means the division on high, middle, low classes in society will never be changed. The middle wants to be the high and they'll act ""on behalf of the low"" to dethrone the high. Afterwards, a new middle class arises, all will change except the low. The high and middle make and uphold the law, the low (proletarian) is just too stupid to revolt. The state maintains its structure by torture, intimidation, violence, and brainwashing.

Blimey, Orwell's Animal Farm is already depressing, but 1984 gives ""depression"" a new meaning, at least for me."
1424,M,A Game of Thrones ,"May 05, 2011",1,"I am on page 470, and although it pains me to put a book down unfinished, it is simply time for me to quit.

A Song of Ice and Fire is the Grey's Anatomy of fantasy. It isn't perfect in the beginning (it's pretty flawed, actually), but you think ""That's okay, the premise is good! It will improve!"" And then before you know it, everyone is having everyone else's baby and murdering their mother (who is also their sister, and a schizophrenic) and traveling around on horseback setting things on fire for no apparent reason.

The characterization is painfully, painfully flat. I'm tempted to go through the text and count the number of times Jon Snow is referred to as a bastard. I get it! His mother is not his father's wife! He is a bastard! Please, god, can we move on now? No, we can't move on; here on page 470, AGAIN, Jon points out in dialogue that he is a bastard. (Cue self-inflicted eye-stabbing.) The kicker: Jon Snow is probably the deepest character in the book.

And exactly like Grey's Anatomy, there comes a moment (often when a character married to two people at once and pregnant with some other dude's baby decides to throw herself off a bridge, and then survives, but is left in a coma that can only be cured by the medicine her dead best friend left in her nightstand) when you just can't take one more bit of drama just for the sake of it. (Plus, I totally cheated and looked up what happens in the sequels, and the plot only gets more convoluted and depressing.)

So yeah, thanks so much to all you guys who rated this FIVE STARS. I would like to know what you've been smoking, because it apparently gives you the power to turn crap into gold."
1425,Mwanamali,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Apr 22, 2020",5,"I want to be mad that I never read this before. But there's something indescribable and magical about experiencing a book for the first time. I can only be grateful that I finally got to read it. 

Perks follows the story of Charlie, who is the most lovable character I have read since Dante from Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe- which coincidentally, is one of my favourite books. 

He has the best teacher ever since Miss Honey. Bill notices something special in Charlie. 


""Do you always think this much Charlie?""
""Is that bad?"" I just wanted someone to tell me the truth.
""Not necessarily. It's just that sometimes people use thought to not participate in life.""
""Is that bad?""
""Yes.""

Charlie of course doesn't read the writing on the wall until his fast talking friend, Patrick tells it to him straight.


""He's a wallflower."" And Bob really nodded his head. And the whole room nodded their head. And I started to feel nervous in the Bob way, but Patrick didn't let me get too nervous. He sat down next to me. ""You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.""


And that my friends, is the main perk of being a wallflower. Charlie's entire existence is just so pure. And it makes you want to hug him. I loved how he loved Sam, his other bff and love interest. In his letter about Sam, he tries to describe her photo to Dear Friend.


If you listen to the song ""Asleep"", and you think about those pretty weather days that make you remember things, and you think about the prettiest eyes you've known, and you cry and the person holds you back then I think you will see the photograph.


The entire novel is in epistolary format. Written in Charlie's nearly childlike way of speaking. I loved it because it felt like he was writing to me and it reminded me that he was still just 15. The saddest thing about this book is Charlie finally confronting his demons, put there by someone he trusted not to hurt him. But still he overcomes. Charlie has more fortitude in his pinky than I do in my entire body. I have learnt so much from him. And in as much as I wish I had met him when I was 15 too, I'm still glad I could meet him when I was old enough to have a lot more insight from his story. 

I wish a lot of things. I wish I had friends like Sam and Patrick. I wish I had a teacher like Bill. I wish I had Charlie's way of staying quiet and understanding the world around him. I wish I had money. I wish many things but most of all I wish I could know what it's like to be infinite."
1426,Lisa of Troy,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,"Jan 23, 2023",3,"If anyone ever tells you that you can‚Äôt write a book, keep in mind Lewis Carroll.

Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice‚Äôs Adventure in Wonderland, is actually a pen name (As Lisa of Troy isn‚Äôt my real name, he already gets bonus points from me). His real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Wikipedia describes him as ‚Äúsomewhat asymmetrical.‚Äù He walked rather stiffly and awkwardly, and he was deaf in one ear. He had a weak chest from a bout of whopping cough and a stammer.

And yet‚Ä¶..

He wrote Alice in Wonderland. 

Everything was smooth sailing from there on out, right?

Of course, not!

In June 1865, the first two thousand copies of Alice‚Äôs Adventure in Wonderland were printed. However, the illustrator, John Tenniel, was so dissatisfied with the printing of the pictures that Carroll decided that all 2,000 copies would be sold as wastepaper. Carroll wrote in his journal about how he probably would not even break even. 

According to Wikipedia, there are only 22 known copies of the ‚Äúwastepaper‚Äù version in existence, and they are incredibly valuable. 

Here‚Äôs hoping that my mistakes will one day be worth millions!

What did I think of the story itself?

Dodgson made some huge gambles. For starters, he picked a female protagonist in the 1860‚Äôs. Alice is having adventures, not talking about boys or love. Thank you, Mr. Dodgson!

The author is also highly creative, inventing all different kinds of characters from the Cheshire Cat to the Queen of Hearts. Alice also drinks and eats to become smaller and larger. This was such a great concept to think about. Aren‚Äôt there instances where you feel like you have very little power, almost voiceless, and other instances where you feel like you can make a great big difference, where you are a key player?

‚ÄúWhat is an unbirthday present?‚Äù
‚ÄúA present given when it isn‚Äôt your birthday, of course.‚Äù

The opening to Alice‚Äôs Adventure in Wonderland is such an intriguing scene. Alice sees a rabbit dressed up, looking at his watch, and stating, ‚ÄúOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!‚Äù For me, this is the perfect blend of reality and fantasy. I can imagine being in a park and seeing a rabbit hopping out from his or her hiding place. It isn‚Äôt too far of a stretch to imagine it also clothed and talking.

In Through the Looking-Glass, there is a poem within the book entitled, Jabberwocky, which I read back in nineth grade. Reading it again, it almost cries out to be read aloud. It is so much fun!

Also, traces of Through The Looking-Glass can be seen in Neil Gaiman‚Äôs Coraline which I loved.

However, this type of literary genre is not my favorite. Philip Pullman (my favorite author) says this of how to write, ‚Äúthink of some interesting events, put them in the right order to make clear the connections between them, and recount them as clearly as you can.‚Äù In this particular case, I didn‚Äôt see the connection between scenes. Alice seems to shift quickly between her interactions, and I don‚Äôt understand how this is one united story. Because the story is so disjointed, I didn‚Äôt feel like we were making any progress and didn‚Äôt feel the suspense rising.

The other question when you go into an alternate realm is ‚ÄúHow are we going to get home?‚Äù The answer to that question in this book is entirely underwhelming.

Based on my research, it appears that there is some symbolism underneath the story, but I don‚Äôt fully understand what that is. Perhaps it is a function of not living in the Victorian era or understanding the politics and mores of Oxford.

Now if only I can think of a children‚Äôs story that will stand the test of time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if not, I guess at least I‚Äôm not asymmetrical.

1427,Sean Barrs,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Jun 17, 2014",5,"I finished reading this last night, and afterwards I spent an entire hour staring into space so I could contemplate over the majesty of this work. It left me speechless. This book is exquisite; it is an investigation into the human soul, the power of vanity and the problems of living a life with not a single consequence for your actions. It‚Äôs truly powerful stuff. 

It begins with a simple realisation, and perhaps an obvious one. But, for Dorian it is completely life changing. He realises that beauty is finite. It won‚Äôt last forever. It‚Äôs like a flower, temporary and splendid. So if you‚Äôre a young man whose appearance is your singular quality, then this is some damn scary news. People only want to be with you because you‚Äôre attractive and charming; they want to be near you, and with you, for your looks only. 

So when that goes what do you have left? 

Nothing. 

No friends. 

No love. 

Only age. 

So what do you do? How do you retain your singular quality? Well, the answer is simple, you copy Doctor Faustus (The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus) and sell your soul to the devil!

""How sad it is!"" murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait. ""How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June. . . . If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that -- for that -- I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!""

  

And this is where the real depravity begins. Dorian‚Äôs world has no consequences. Everything he does is attributed to the painting, everything. Any regret or malice leaves him quickly and is transferred to the canvas. So he can‚Äôt technically feel emotion for an extended period of time; thus, his attitude becomes one of nonchalance. He becomes a shell, an emotionless creature who can only seek his sin: vanity. He surrounds himself with beauty. His house is full of art, brilliant music and every luxury known to man. You name it. Dorian‚Äôs got it. Only through seeking new experiences, these pleasures, can Dorian‚Äôs being remain animated. I intentionally used the word ‚Äúbeing‚Äù for Dorian‚Äôs body no longer harbours his soul; it‚Äôs in the painting. Everything he does is for his own indulgence; he just doesn‚Äôt care what affect his presence has on others. The prefect moment is all he lives for. 

‚ÄúI don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.‚Äù

The character of Dorian Gray is an interesting study because he is representative of many things. He shows how a seemingly pure soul can be corrupted if it‚Äôs left in a sense of privation and given terrible guidance. Also he is suggestive of the Victorian ideal of the perfect societal image. One must be respectable at all times, and have all the appropriate airs and graces. But behind closed doors, or perhaps even a curtain, anything goes. He is suggestive of the hidden evils of Victorian society as behind the mask was many dark things. For example, the Empire and colonialism to the Victorians was a wonderful thing; it built wealth and structure, but in reality it destroyed culture and subjected peoples to slavery. The same things can be said of child labour, the exploitation of women and terrible working conditions. Everything exists behind a veil of grandeur, and this is no less true for Dorian. 

The homosexual suggestions are practically ground-breaking. Wilde wasn‚Äôt the only Victorian author to suggest such things. Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äôs  The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde  can be read in a similar vein, but Wilde was much more explicit. It‚Äôs not cryptic; it‚Äôs just plain homosexual lust for all to see on the part of Basil and (perhaps?) even Sir Henry later on. It‚Äôs still rather horrific that Wilde was actually arrested for homosexual acts. Silly Victorians. The novel also shows that despite being corrupted to such a degree, to commit murder in such a terrible sense, Dorian (the Victorian man?) isn‚Äôt beyond all redemption. He can still come back from his deeds and end it all. The ending was perfection. This has great allegorical meaning.

Some books are powerful for their readers because of their context; in this case, the utter lack in popular kid's literature of 1962 of characters like Meg‚Äîreal girls, who cared about atypical subjects like math, who were unashamed to be other than pink-wearing cheerleaders. To find a powerful role model in a novel must be a wonderful thing, especially for bookish girls. And maybe it makes sense that as a boy in the seventies, I missed that entirely. 

Still, rereading as an adult, I found it unbearably heavy-handed. Hence the two star rating: It was okay.]

One of those overrated books the response to which defies explanation. Clunky, heavy-handed, and as obvious in its way as The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I was only ever able to force myself through this as an adult (having been turned off of it by a filmstrip I saw in school), and no doubt this is the sort of novel--like the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs--that must be first loved as a younger reader.

before I start I should say:


&
second,

""Read Rick Riordan's books in English or you miss half the FUN!""

I saw that happened!

This Book/Series/Universe is a ""must read"" to anyone who loves myths, Regardless of Age. {for proof: I read it first when I was 22 & fell in love immediately by the first sentences! (which was the chapter's title!)} though it probably depends on you have active inner child & love mythology in modern days with lots of fun or not too. (my dad liked it too.)
it's an art to write a book suitable for everyone.
& Percy's character reminded me of one of my teenage years bookish crush, Bobby in Pendragon series by D. J. MacHale; sassy, quick witty comebacks with funny thoughts & comparisons in the narration.

First book in the masterpiece of Riordanverse,
First book in Camp Half-Blood Chronicles
I LOVE ALL UNCLE RICK'S BOOKS!

the way it started, from the very first page, it shows & promises how amazing & funny it would be. I mean, just look at the chapters name!
I laughed with almost every sentences!
(also full of ""I-can-relate"" moments!)

2019: I read this for my dad & he actually liked it very much. another proof for this story is regardless of age XD (also I was a very good narrator.)

1431,Nataliya,The Great Gatsby,"May 02, 2010",5,"Oh Gatsby, you old sport, you poor semi-delusionally hopeful dreamer with ‚Äúsome heightened sensitivity to the promises of life‚Äù, focusing your whole self and soul on that elusive money-colored green light - a dream that shatters just when you are *this* close to it. 



Jay Gatsby, who dreamed a dream with the passion and courage few possess - and the tragedy was that it was a wrong dream colliding with reality that was even more wrong - and deadly. 

Just like the Great Houdini - the association the title of this book so easily invokes - you specialized in illusions and escape. Except even the power of most courageous dreamers can be quite helpless to allow us escape the world, our past, and ourselves, giving rise to one of the most famous closing lines of a novel.
‚ÄúGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that‚Äôs no matter ‚Äî to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning ‚Äî‚Äî 

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.‚Äù
Dear Gatsby, not everything I liked back when I was fourteen has withstood the test of time¬π - but you clearly did, and as I get older, closer to your and Nick Carraway's age, your story gathers more dimensions and more tragedy, fleshing out so much more from what I thought of as a tragic love story when I was a child - turning into a great American tragedy.¬π I hang my head in shame at my ability to still belt out an enthusiastic (albeit poorly rendered) version of '...Baby One More Time' when it comes on the radio (provided, of course, that my car windows are safely up).

I blame it on my residual teenage hormones.



Jay Gatsby, you barged head-on to achieve and conquer your American dream, not stopping until your dreams became your reality, until you reinvented yourself with the dizzying strength of your belief. Your tragedy was that you equated your dream with money, and money with happiness and love. And honestly, given the messed up world we live in, you were not that far from getting everything you thought you wanted, including the kind of love that hinges on the green dollar signs. 

And you *almost* saw it, you poor bastard, but in the end you chose to let your delusion continue, you poor soul.

Poor Gatsby! Yours is the story of a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, running like a hamster on the wheel amassing wealth for the sake of love, for the sake of winning the heart of a Southern belle, the one whose 
‚Äúvoice is full of money‚Äù
 - in a book written by a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, desperately running on the hamster wheel of 'high life' to win the heart of his own Southern belle. Poor Gatsby, and poor F. Scott Fitzgerald - the guy who so brilliantly described it all, but who continued to live the life his character failed to see for what it was.



The Great Gatsby is a story about the lavish excesses meant to serve every little whim of the rich and wannabe-rich in the splendid but unsatisfying in their shallow emptiness glitzy and gaudy post-war years, and the resulting suffocation under the uselessness and unexpected oppressiveness of elusive American dream in the time when money was plenty and the alluring seemingly dream life was just around the corner, just within reach.

But first and foremost, it is a story of disillusionment with dreams that prove to be shallow and unworthy of the dreamer - while at the same time firmly hanging on to the idea of the dream, the ability to dream big, and the stubborn tenacity of the dreamer, 
‚Äúan extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again‚Äù
.



This is why Gatsby is still so relevant in the world we live in - almost a hundred years after Fitzgerald wrote it in the Roaring Twenties - the present-day world that still worships money and views it as a substitute for the American dream, the world that hinges on materialism, the world that no longer frowns on the gaudiness and glitz of the nouveau riche. 

In this world Jay Gatsby, poor old sport, with his huge tasteless mansion and lavish tasteless parties and in-your-face tasteless car and tasteless pink suit would be, perhaps, quietly sniggered at - but would have fit in without the need for aristocratic breeding - who cares if he has the money and the ability to throw parties worthy of reality show fame??? 



Because in the present world just the fact of having heaps of money makes you worthy - and therefore the people whose voices are ‚Äúfull of money‚Äù, who are ‚Äúgleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor‚Äù, people who genuinely believe that money makes them worthy and invincible are all too common. Tom and Daisy Buchanan would be proud of them. 

And wannabe Gatsbys pour their capacity to dream into chasing the shallow dream of dollar signs, nothing more.
‚ÄúThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy ‚Äî they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.‚Äù






This book somehow hit the right note back when I read it when I was fourteen, and hit even truer note now, deeply resonating with me now, almost a full century since it was written. If you read it for school years ago, I ask you to pick it up and give its pages another look - and it may amaze you.

1432,Annette,Twilight ,"Apr 21, 2008",1,"Ok... I know that I'm going to offend a lot of people with this review, but I feel that I have to be honest about this. There are quite a few things that bother me about this book, I will only list the top 5 here:

1) Bella - She is the exact character that I do NOT want my daughters to have as a role model. She is a sighing, swooning, fainting, weeping, weak female character straight out of the 19 century. This is the 21st century people! Do we want to raise a generation of namby pamby young women who can't stand on their own two feet?

2) Edward - This is the kind of guy that I warn my daughters to stay away from. The guy sneaks into her room and watches her sleep. Does anyone else see anything creepy about this? He's obsessed with rescuing her and he thinks that if he doesn't follow her around 24/7 that she'll get herself into a dangerous situation that she can't handle. Does anyone else see anything creepy about this?

3) The relationship - This is a textbook case of co-dependency if I ever saw one. They hardly know each other, but suddenly they can't live without each other? The dialogue is like something straight out of a Harlequin - ugh! I think that young people have enough trouble knowing the difference between love and lust and this book does not help.

4) Too much emphasis on appearances - It's like Edward's good looks are all that matters, personality is not important. Bella must be good looking too, why else would a 100 year old vampire be interested in a 17 year old girl? Her personality leaves much to be desired so we know it's not that.

5) The comparison between this series and the Harry Potter series - If I were J.K. Rowling I would be offended that people are comparing the Twilight series with the Harry Potter series. Stephani Meyer's writing is NOT up to par with J.K. Rowling - not even close.

The worst thing about this book is that it's so hugely popular. There are thousands of young girls all over the nation who are swooning over Edward and wishing that they could be ""just like Bella"" - gag! I truly think that this book is a detriment to society. There's a lot more I could say, but I think that I've offended enough people for now."
1433,Fernando,Fahrenheit 451,"Feb 08, 2012",5,"""No hace falta quemar libros para que una cultura desaparezca. Mucho peor es no leerlos"" - Ray Bradbury

Cuesta mucho encontrar en el vasto mundo de la literatura un libro que defienda precisamente al libro como patrimonio cultural de la Humanidad. M√°s all√° de la distop√≠a que encierra, la maestr√≠a de Bradbury nos posiciona ante los peligros que a veces significa para el poder el hecho de que la gente ""piense"" y quiera valerse por s√≠ misma. Uno de mis libro preferidos de toda la vida...

Esta era mi peque√±a rese√±a all√° por el 2015, cuando este libro inolvidable de un tambi√©n inolvidable Ray Bradbury dominaba mi sentidos y se transformaba en uno de mis preferidos de toda la vida. Y a√∫n sigue si√©ndolo. A√∫n sigue teniendo esa misma vigencia inalterable en m√≠.
Es que mi grado de admiraci√≥n hacia el viejo Ray sigue en ascenso y no se detendr√° nunca. Es un escritor del que aprendo. Esa es la palabra. Es un maestro, un abuelo, un profesor y un profeta. Todo lo que irradi√≥ en su literatura fue sabidur√≠a y genialidad. Sus novelas y cuentos est√°n poblados de ense√±anzas y advertencias. Mensajes y premoniciones. Fue un erudito, un escritor que supo ver mucho antes todas las calamidades que golpearon a la Humanidad sumi√©ndola en un sopor de las que muchas veces le cost√≥ salir.
Anticip√≥ avances tecnol√≥gicos tambi√©n. A partir de libros como ""Cr√≥nicas marcianas"", ""El hombre ilustrado"" o ""Las doradas manzanas del sol"" supo advertirnos que el futuro pod√≠a transformarse en algo peligroso e inc√≥modo.
Al final de esta novela se percibe ese aire enrarecido de una latente cat√°strofe que hace eclosi√≥n arrasando una ciudad. ¬øAcaso hoy no sentimos esa opresiva preocupaci√≥n con las pruebas nucleares de un dictador desequilibrado en la supuestamente remota Corea del Norte?
Esto y lo sab√≠a Ray Bradbury. √âl nos dijo que cometimos el error luego de la segunda bomba mundial y que probablemente podamos volver a cometerlo. Porque somos humanos, falibles, inestables. Hemos atravesado √©pocas de paz y guerra, pero siempre se han vivido largos a√±os de desigualdad. De poder desmedido sobre gente oprimida y esa disparidad puede terminar mal.
En ""Fahrenheit 451"" , se nos pinta una sociedad controlada y vigilada. El libro es una de las tres mejores distop√≠as que puedan leerse junto con ""1984"" y ""Un mundo feliz"". En la contratapa de la novela Kingsley Amis dice que ""De entre todos los infiernos del conformismo, Fahrenheit 451 ofrece el retrato m√°s convincente."" Disiento a medias con el se√±or Amis. 
Creo que ese conformismo est√° m√°s exacerbado en ""Un mundo feliz"", en donde la dist√≥pica Humanidad de la novela de Huxley est√° sedada por el soma y la gente no sufre preocupaciones. Es una sociedad controlada por f√°rmacos, y se distancia mucho de la de Ocean√≠a, de ""1984"", en donde vive Winston, all√≠ las cosas son m√°s dif√≠ciles e incluso mucho m√°s peligrosas a√∫n que las de ""Fahrenheit 451"".
En ""Fahrenheit 451"", su personaje principal, Guy Montag es parte de un cuerpo de bomberos que no apaga incendios sino se dedica a quemar libros de aquellos descarriados que el sistema no llega a controlar hasta que son denunciados, porque como digo al principio, el poder que controla todo es peligroso que el ser humano piense, se valga por s√≠ mismo, se apoye en lo que escritores, fil√≥sofos y pensadores y queda evidenciado en el pensamiento del capit√°n Beatty, jefe de Montag y del cuartel de bomberos cuando insidiosamente sostiene: ""Un libro es un arma cargada en la casa de al lado. Qu√©malo. Quita el proyectil del arma. Domina la mente del hombre. ¬øQui√©n sabe cu√°l podr√≠a ser el objetivo del hombre que leyese mucho? Yo, no lo resistir√≠a un minuto.""
La frase de Beatty nos refiere hasta ese punto se ha llegado. Sin la violencia explicita ni el totalitarismo desmedido de ""1984"", la sociedad en esta novela es vigilada, controlada, perseguida y castigada, si es necesario. 
Las tres distop√≠as tienen algo bien claro en com√∫n y son los tres personajes principales de cada una de ellas: Guy Montag en este libro, Winston en ""1984"" y Bernard Marx en ""Un mundo feliz"".
¬øPor qu√©? Bueno, precisamente por querer salirse del sistema, por rebelarse, por querer demostrar que su realidad es injusta y que no se puede vivir as√≠. Se salen de su curso, comienzan a realizar peque√±os actos subversivos, se suman a las minor√≠as que resisten estos crueles totalitarismo y como es de prever, son descubiertos.
Montag, al igual que los h√©roes de los otros libros, descubre a la vez lo que deber√≠a estar bien pero sigue mal. Su vida est√° en suspenso. Cuando Clare McLellan, esa chica que conoce y que lo saca de su abotargamiento le hace la simple pregunta ""¬øEres feliz?"", simplemente no sabe qu√© responder.
Ha estado viviendo por a√±os con una esposa que es en s√≠ pr√°cticamente una desconocida. Mildred es una mujer hueca, vac√≠a, ausente, atontada por sus enormes pantallas. Su vida es anodina, supuestamente agradable pero fr√≠a, sint√©tica. No tiene ning√∫n tipo de acercamiento con Montag y las cosas siguen adelante por su propia inercia. Son dos desconocidos que alguna vez se casaron y viven juntos. Solamente eso.
Durante una de sus salidas con los bomberos, Montag tendr√° una experiencia en extremo shockeante y a partir de ella no ser√° el mismo. Prontamente ""despertar√°"" para acercarse a lo m√°s peligroso e inconveniente que pueda cruzarse en su vida: los libros.
No seguir√© adentr√°ndome en la historia porque siempre hay lectores que no leyeron ""Fahrenheit 451"", pero s√≠ sostendr√© lo expuesto al principio de esta rese√±a:
El libro, es uno de los mayores tesoros que la Humanidad ha tenido y tendr√° por siempre. No importa que alg√∫n d√≠a sean devorado por las llamas, porque eso ya pas√≥ muchas veces, la √∫ltima vez a manos del nazismo. 
El libro nunca morir√°, porque es eterno. La defensa de Bradbury en ""Fahrenheit 451"" es inspiradora, sanadora y edificante. El libro es un objeto precioso, una gema, es ese amigo que nunca decepciona como dec√≠a Carlyle.
Un libro nos hace sentir orgullosos como personas lectoras, nos dignifica, nos ense√±a. Para un lector pasar cuidadosamente los dedos por sus p√°ginas es una darle caricia, un mimo. ""Los libros van siendo el √∫nico lugar de la casa donde a√∫n se puede estar tranquilo"", dec√≠a don Julio Cort√°zar y no se equivocaba. Aquel que no es lector tal vez no entienda el por qu√© de tanta pasi√≥n, tanto amor, tanta admiraci√≥n que los lectores tenemos por los libros.
Bradbury nos dice que en el fondo no importa que desaparezcan mientras nosotros, los lectores los tengamos en la mente y en el coraz√≥n y creo que ese es el mensaje que quiere dejarnos al final de esta novela a partir de esos ""hombres libros"" con los que Montag se encuentra en el bosque luego de su persecuci√≥n. 
¬øPinta algo inveros√≠mil Bradbury en este libro? No. ¬øAcaso no han sido muchas personas perseguidas o asesinadas a partir de sus pensamientos, de lo que escribieron o de lo que intentaron cambiar a partir de las l√≠neas de un libro? Claro que no.
Siempre, este libro ser√° uno de mis preferidos porque casualmente es un libro cuyo tema principal trata acerca de la importancia que siempre ha tenido en nosotros.
Todos los d√≠as agradezco a Dios el haberme dado esta pasi√≥n por los libros y tambi√©n le digo gracias a Ray Bradbury por haberme ense√±ado a ser un mejor lector."
1434,Chelsea Humphrey,A Game of Thrones ,"Feb 01, 2020",3,"Well, I made it friends. This made for one of the most odd reading experiences I've ever encountered. I was completely enamored with the story, as the world building and intricate detailing into the politics of the seven kingdoms is exquisite, yet every time I picked up this book it felt like a chore to read. This could be perhaps due to the fact that, after waiting 900 years to read these books I've already encountered most of the twists and spoilers, which takes away some of the anticipation. Either way, I respect what George R.R. Martin has created here, and despite my slow going, I'm interested in continuing on."

I went into this story ready to fall in love! Ready to buy all of the merch upon finishing this story that's loved by so many but here I am, sulking. Disappointed. I guess this story just goes completely against my nature. There's no logical reason for anything that happens and that frustrated me beyond belief. Every conversation was so exhausting to read. I literally had to take ibuprofen every time I was finished reading for the night because my god, the headaches were no joke. 
I'm very saddened that I won't be fangirling over this fandom.
Side note: Am I a terrible person to admit that Alice got on my nerves!? Arghhhhhhhhhh. AND EVERY CHARACTER WAS SO FLIPPIN' RUDE!!"

But in ourselves.



This is the first time I‚Äôve truly been at a loss for words. What am I supposed to say? How can I do this book justice? Maybe tell you all that it was perfect? The best, most heartbreaking, hilarious book that has touched me like none other? Sure. I mean, it's been said countless times, in countless reviews, and you know what? They are absolutely, a hundred and fifty percent true.

Hazel's days are numbered thanks to her crap lungs. She was able to buy a few years more, thanks to a miracle, but she isn't fooling herself. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten. 


I don't think I've ever cried so much, laughed so much, just over all enjoyed a book as much as I have while reading The Fault in Our Stars. Everything that goes on is serious, heartbreaking and eye opening but John Green does an amazing job at, literally, making you laugh out loud. Even when you're suffering. 

Hazel... what a breathe of fresh air her character was. She was real and I loved her no bullshit attitude. She wasn't fooling herself, and John Green didn't make her out to be ecstatic with the world or her situation. She wasn't bitchy or depressing, but it wasn't like she was perfectly fine to sit idly and watch the time tick by.

Augustus Waters is my dream guy. Like, for real. As I wrote on an update: Screw all the Christian Grey‚Äôs and the Gideon Cross‚Äô, just give be Augustus Waters.

As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.

I fell in love with everything that was‚Ä¶ him.
I was completely emotionally invested into the story. It‚Äôs not just the main characters that stole my heart, Isaac, the parents, even her damn tank, Phillip, did as well. It was beautiful, it was hilarious, and it was perfect.

""Maybe okay will be our always.""

Everybody tells you to have your tissues fully loaded because you‚Äôre going to need them, and of course my first thought is suuuureee. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve teared up in plenty of books, but actually cried? Nah. Well, I step down and admit defeat. I freakin‚Äô sobbed my heart out. John Green, you‚Äôve done what only few have been able to do... make me cry.


*A thanks to all the ladies that BR this with me (and the ones who crashed it) I wouldn‚Äôt have gone near this one with a ten foot pole without you all ;)"
