1,Epic Fantasy,"Epic Fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy that is set in invented or parallel world. It is most commonly considered to be the same genre as High Fantasy, since they share many of the same elements, but Epic Fantasy takes the story even farther, in a bigger and more epic way (e.g. the stakes are greater; the land/world is in peril; a great evil threatens the world; the conflict shakes all who dwell in the world of the story).

Epic Fantasy became more famous through the works of such as: Brandon Sanderson, Brent Weeks, Robert Jordan, Robin Hobb, Patrick Rothfuss, Scott Lynch, Joe Abercrombie, Terry Brooks, Raymond E. Feist, Tad Williams, George R.R. Martin, Steven Erikson, and more; though it's origins come long before, from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings."
2,Mythology,"The term mythology can refer to a body of myths or to any traditional story. A myth is a sacred narrative explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form. The main characters in myths are usually gods or supernatural heroes.

The study of myth began in ancient history. Rival classes of the Greek myths by Euhemerus, Plato and Sallustius were developed by the Neoplatonists and later revived by Renaissance mythographers. The nineteenth-century comparative mythology reinterpreted myth as a primitive and failed counterpart of science (Tylor), a ""disease of language"" (Müller), or a misinterpretation of magical ritual (Frazer)."
3,Middle Grade,Middle grade is fiction aimed at children aged roughly between the ages of eight and twelve.
4,Self Help,"Self-help, or self-improvement, is a self-guided improvement[1]—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help groupings exist and each has its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. ""Self-help culture, particularly Twelve-Step culture, has provided some of our most robust new language: recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency.""[2]"
5,High Fantasy,"High fantasy is defined as fantasy fiction set in an alternative, entirely fictional (""secondary"") world, rather than the real, or ""primary"" world. The secondary world is usually internally consistent but its rules differ in some way(s) from those of the primary world. By contrast, low fantasy is characterized by being set in the primary, or ""real"" world, or a rational and familiar fictional world, with the inclusion of magical elements."
6,Gothic,"Gothic fiction is a genre of literature that combines elements of both the uncanny and romance. As a genre, it is generally believed to have been invented by the English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto. Gothic fiction is considered to be the parent genre for both Horror and Mystery, among other genres.

The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. Melodrama and parody (including self-parody) were other long-standing features of the Gothic initiated by Walpole.

Gothic literature is intimately associated with the Gothic Revival architecture of the same era. In a way similar to the gothic revivalists' rejection of the clarity and rationalism of the neoclassical style of the Enlightened Establishment, the literary Gothic embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion, the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the sublime, and a quest for atmosphere. The ruins of gothic buildings gave rise to multiple linked emotions by representing the inevitable decay and collapse of human creations — thus the urge to add fake ruins as eye catchers in English landscape parks. English Gothic writers often associated medieval buildings with what they saw as a dark and terrifying period, characterized by harsh laws enforced by torture, and with mysterious, fantastic, and superstitious rituals. In literature such anti-Catholicism had a European dimension featuring Roman Catholic excesses such as the Inquisition (in southern European countries such as Italy and Spain).

Prominent features of Gothic fiction include terror (both psychological and physical), mystery, the supernatural, ghosts, haunted houses and Gothic architecture, castles, darkness, death, decay, doubles, madness, secrets, and hereditary curses.

The stock characters of Gothic fiction include tyrants, villains, bandits, maniacs, Byronic heroes, persecuted maidens, femmes fatales, monks, nuns, madwomen, magicians, vampires, werewolves, monsters, demons, angels, fallen angels, revenants, ghosts, perambulating skeletons, the Wandering Jew and the Devil himself."
7,Drama,"Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning ""action"" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drama), which is derived from ""to do"" or ""to act"" (Classical Greek: δράω, draō). The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.

Drama is also used as synonym of Dramatic (Situations of misfortunes that move vividly)."
8,Classics,"A classic stands the test of time. The work is usually considered to be a representation of the period in which it was written; and the work merits lasting recognition. In other words, if the book was published in the recent past, the work is not a classic. 

A classic has a certain universal appeal. Great works of literature touch us to our very core beings--partly because they integrate themes that are understood by readers from a wide range of backgrounds and levels of experience. Themes of love, hate, death, life, and faith touch upon some of our most basic emotional responses. 

Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature from all traditions, such as the Chinese classics or the Indian Vedas.

Disambiguation: The study of ancient (""classical"") civilisations and languages, see Classical studies."
9,Mental Health,
10,Paranormal,"The paranormal genre of literary fiction includes beings and phenomena that are outside the realm of normal scientific understanding of the natural world. Though the paranormal genre may include supernaturalist elements, this fiction genre generally includes creatures that have been popularized by folklore, fairy tales, and popular culture, such as fairies, aliens, shapeshifters, and the undead.

Subgenres that generally fall into the paranormal fiction category include paranormal romance , urban fantasy, fantasy romance novels, and paranormal fantasy."
11,Mystery Thriller,"Mystery-thrillers are stories with twists and turns that keep you on your toes guessing about the truth, the POV's truth, and about what will happen next. They can be written from a hero's POV or from a sinister character's POV. Some are scary and make your heart beat faster, making it hard to put down. Some stories make you laugh if you have a witty writer with an unusual sense of humor easy to relate to. Both types can be hard to put down when they're page turners. And you can find many page turners among a variety of styles and writers, depending on what seeks your fancy.

12,Novels,"A novel is a long prose narrative that usually describes fictional characters and events in the form of a sequential story. It rests on the consensus that the novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose, followed by the novella, novelette and the short story. However, there is no consensus as to the minimal required lenght. In part because of this wide variation, the boundary between a novella and a novel may be arbitrary and difficult to determine.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America specifies a word length of over 40,000 words for a novel, while National Novel Writing Month requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words."
13,Plays,"A play is a form of literature written by a playwright, usually consisting of scripted dialogue between characters, intended for theatrical performance rather than just reading."
14,Romance,"According to the Romance Writers of America, ""Two basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally-satisfying and optimistic ending."" Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Other definitions of a romance novel may be broader, including other plots and endings or more than two people, or narrower, restricting the types of romances or conflicts."
15,Fiction,"Fiction is the telling of stories which are not real. More specifically, fiction is an imaginative form of narrative, one of the four basic rhetorical modes. Although the word fiction is derived from the Latin fingo, fingere, finxi, fictum, ""to form, create"", works of fiction need not be entirely imaginary and may include real people, places, and events. Fiction may be either written or oral. Although not all fiction is necessarily artistic, fiction is largely perceived as a form of art or entertainment. The ability to create fiction and other artistic works is considered to be a fundamental aspect of human culture, one of the defining characteristics of humanity."
16,Thriller,"Thrillers are characterized by fast pacing, frequent action, and resourceful heroes who must thwart the plans of more-powerful and better-equipped villains. Literary devices such as suspense, red herrings and cliffhangers are used extensively.

Thrillers often overlap with mystery stories, but are distinguished by the structure of their plots. In a thriller, the hero must thwart the plans of an enemy, rather than uncover a crime that has already happened. Thrillers also occur on a much grander scale: the crimes that must be prevented are serial or mass murder, terrorism, assassination, or the overthrow of governments. Jeopardy and violent confrontations are standard plot elements. While a mystery climaxes when the mystery is solved, a thriller climaxes when the hero finally defeats the villain, saving his own life and often the lives of others."
17,France,Books that are set in France.
18,Magical Realism,"Magical realism is a fiction genre in which magical elements blend to create a realistic atmosphere that accesses a deeper understanding of reality. The story explains these magical elements as normal occurrences, presented in a straightforward manner that places the ""real"" and the ""fantastic"" in the same stream of thought."
19,Coming Of Age,"A coming-of-age story is a genre of literature that focuses on the growth of a protagonist from youth to adulthood (""coming of age""). Coming-of-age stories tend to emphasize dialogue or internal monologue over action, and are often set in the past or have adults looking back into the past. The subjects of coming-of-age stories are typically males in their mid teens, although sometimes females are the protagonists. Themes of maturation, acculturation, loss of innocence, wisdom and/or acumen, and worldliness are often present. Coming-of-age is a theme that fits multiple genres."
20,Historical,"Historical fiction presents a story set in the past, often during a significant time period. In historical fiction, the time period is an important part of the setting and often of the story itself.

Historical fiction may include fictional characters, well-known historical figures or a mixture of the two. Authors of historical fiction usually pay close attention to the details of their stories (settings, clothing, dialogue, etc.) to ensure that they fit the time periods in which the narratives take place.

In some historical fiction, famous events appear from points of view not recorded in history, showing historical figures dealing with actual events while depicting them in a way that is not recorded in history. Other times, the historical event or time period complements a story's narrative, forming a framework and background for the characters' lives. Sometimes, historical fiction can be for the most part true, but the names of people and places have been in some way altered.

As this is fiction, artistic license is permitted in regard to presentation and subject matter, so long as it does not deviate in significant ways from established history. If events should deviate significantly, the story may then fall into the genre of alternate history, which is known for speculating on what could have happened if a significant historical event had gone differently. On a similar note, events occurring in historical fiction must adhere to the laws of physics. Stories that extend into the magical or fantastic are often considered historical romance."
21,Childrens,"Children's literature is for readers and listeners up to about age 12. It is often illustrated. The term is used in senses that sometimes exclude young-adult fiction, comic books, or other genres. Books specifically for children existed at least several hundred years ago."
22,Spanish Literature,"Spanish literature generally refers to literature (Spanish poetry, prose, and drama) written in the Spanish language within the territory that presently constitutes the state of Spain. Its development coincides and frequently intersects with that of other literary traditions from regions within the same territory, particularly Catalan literature, Galician literature, and more recently a formal Basque literature. In its earliest form, Spanish literature intersects as well with Latin, Jewish, and Arabic literary traditions of the Iberian peninsula. The literature of Spanish America is an important branch of Spanish literature, with its own particular characteristics dating back to the earliest years of Spain’s conquest of the Americas (see Latin American literature)."
23,Animals,"Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). All animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently, at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance."
24,Literature,"Literature is the art of written works. The two most basic written literary categories include fiction and non-fiction, although ""literature"" in popular use can also mean a sub-genre of fiction called literary fiction."
25,Adult Fiction,"Adult fiction, by contrast with childrens or young adult, is fiction intended for (and usually about) adults."
26,Picture Books,"A picture book combines visual and verbal narratives in a book format, most often aimed at young children. The images in picture books use a range of media such as oil paints, acrylics, watercolor and pencil. Two of the earliest books with something like the format picture books still retain now were Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter from 1845 and Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Peter Rabbit from 1902. Some of the best-known picture books are Robert McCloskey's Make Way for Ducklings, Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat, and Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are. The Caldecott Medal (established 1938) and Kate Greenaway Medal (established 1955) are awarded annually for illustrations in children's literature. From the mid-1960s onward, several other children's literature awards began to include a category for picture books."
27,Russia,Books that are set in or about Russia and Russians.
28,Magic,"These are all books that deal with magic: wands, spells, curses, potions, hexes, thoughts (mind-magic), art, symbols, rituals, magical languages, witchcraft, etc.

See also magick for non-fiction."
29,Greek Mythology,"Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. 

Greek Mythology are books about or based on the Ancient Greek myths as well as gods and goddesses. This genre includes books varying from Non-fiction to Fiction."
30,Suspense,"Suspense is a feeling of uncertainty and anxiety about the outcome of certain actions, most often referring to an audience's perceptions in a dramatic work. Suspense is not exclusive to fiction, though. Suspense may operate in any situation where there is a lead up to a big event or dramatic moment, with tension being a primary emotion felt as part of the situation. In the kind of suspense described by film director Alfred Hitchcock, an audience experiences suspense when they expect something bad to happen and have (or believe they have) a superior perspective on events in the drama's hierarchy of knowledge, yet they are powerless to intervene to prevent it from happening. In broader definitions of suspense, this emotion arises when someone is aware of his lack of knowledge about the development of a meaningful event; thus, suspense is a combination of anticipation and uncertainty dealing with the obscurity of the future. In terms of narrative expectations, it may be contrasted with mystery or curiosity and surprise."
31,Read For School,"Any books read by students as part of a school curriculum.

See also high school."
32,Philosophy,"Philosophy is the study of general problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, truth, beauty, justice, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these questions (such as mysticism or mythology) by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument. The word philosophy is of Ancient Greek origin: φιλοσοφία (philosophía), meaning ""love of wisdom."""
33,Historical Fiction,"Historical fiction presents a story set in the past, often during a significant time period. In historical fiction, the time period is an important part of the setting and often of the story itself.

Historical fiction may include fictional characters, well-known historical figures or a mixture of the two. Authors of historical fiction usually pay close attention to the details of their stories (settings, clothing, dialogue, etc.) to ensure that they fit the time periods in which the narratives take place.

In some historical fiction, famous events appear from points of view not recorded in history, showing historical figures dealing with actual events while depicting them in a way that is not recorded in history.

On a similar note, events occurring in historical fiction must adhere to the laws of physics. Stories that extend into the magical or fantastic are often considered historical fantasy.

34,Time Travel,"Time travel is the concept of moving between different points in time in a manner analogous to moving between different points in space. Time travel could hypothetically involve moving backward in time to a moment earlier than the starting point, or forward to the future of that point without the need for the traveler to experience the intervening period (at least not at the normal rate). Time travel can form the central theme of a book or it can simply be a plot device to drive a story. Time travel in fiction can ignore the possible effects of the time traveler's actions or it can explore its repercussions (ie: paradoxes)."
35,Horror,"Horror fiction is fiction in any medium intended to scare, unsettle, or horrify the audience. Historically, the cause of the ""horror"" experience has often been the intrusion of a supernatural element into everyday human experience. Since the 1960s, any work of fiction with a morbid, gruesome, surreal, or exceptionally suspenseful or frightening theme has come to be called ""horror"". Horror fiction often overlaps science fiction or fantasy, all three of which categories are sometimes placed under the umbrella classification speculative fiction."
36,Fantasy,"Fantasy is a genre that uses magic and other supernatural forms as a primary element of plot, theme, and/or setting. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of technological and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (collectively known as speculative fiction or science fiction/fantasy)

In its broadest sense, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today, including young adults, most of whom are represented by the works below."
37,Vampires,"Vampires are mythological or folkloric beings who subsist by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of living creatures, regardless of whether they are undead or a living person. They are characterized by fangs, usually retractable, used to suck blood. Vampires are usually killed by a stake to the heart and direct exposure to sunlight. They are often warded off by crosses and the smell of garlic. Since they are undead, they are generally immortal unless killed by one of the aforementioned methods. Often, many are blessed with unnatural and inhuman strength and senses."
38,Science Fiction,"Science fiction (abbreviated SF or sci-fi with varying punctuation and capitalization) is a broad genre of fiction that often involves speculations based on current or future science or technology. Science fiction is found in books, art, television, films, games, theatre, and other media. In organizational or marketing contexts, science fiction can be synonymous with the broader definition of speculative fiction, encompassing creative works incorporating imaginative elements not found in contemporary reality; this includes fantasy, horror and related genres.

Although the two genres are often conflated as science fiction/fantasy, science fiction differs from fantasy in that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). Exploring the consequences of such differences is the traditional purpose of science fiction, making it a ""literature of ideas"". Science fantasy is largely based on writing entertainingly and rationally about alternate possibilities in settings that are contrary to known reality."
39,Politics,"Politics (from Greek πολιτικός, ""of, for, or relating to citizens""), is a process by which groups of people make collective decisions. The term is generally applied to the art or science of running governmental or state affairs. It also refers to behavior within civil governments. However, politics can be observed in other group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. It consists of ""social relations involving authority or power"" and refers to the regulation of public affairs within a political unit, and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply policy."
40,Young Adult,"Young-adult fiction (often abbreviated as YA) is fiction written for, published for, or marketed to adolescents and young adults, roughly ages 13 to 18. 

Young-adult fiction, whether in the form of novels or short stories, has distinct attributes that distinguish it from the other age categories of fiction. The vast majority of YA stories portray an adolescent as the protagonist, rather than an adult or a child. The subject matter and story lines are typically consistent with the age and experience of the main character, but beyond that YA stories span the entire spectrum of fiction genres. The settings of YA stories are limited only by the imagination and skill of the author. 

Themes in YA stories often focus on the challenges of youth, so much so that the entire age category is sometimes referred to as problem novels or coming of age novel. Writing styles of YA stories range widely, from the richness of literary style to the clarity and speed of the unobtrusive. Despite its unique characteristics, YA shares the fundamental elements of fiction with other stories: character, plot, setting, theme, and style."

42,Humor,"A comic novel is usually a work of fiction in which the writer seeks to amuse the reader, sometimes with subtlety and as part of a carefully woven narrative, sometimes above all other considerations. It could indeed be said that comedy fiction is literary work that aims primarily to provoke laughter, but this isn't always as obvious as it first may seem."
43,Spirituality,"Spirituality may refer to almost any kind of meaningful activity, personal growth, or blissful experience.

Traditionally, spirituality refers to a process of re-formation of the personality but there is no precise definition of spirituality."
44,Comedy,"In a modern sense, comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or to amuse by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece."
45,Japan,Books that are set in Japan.
46,Audiobook,"An audiobook is a recording of text. Audiobooks are available in a variety of lengths and formats, most popularly through digital download, which allows people to listen on any smart device. 

Spoken audio was first made available in the 1930s on vinyl records and has seen a resurgence in recent years with the proliferation of smartphones and other portable devices. As the medium has gained listeners—with people looking to read while driving, exercising, cleaning house and more—it has expanded past recordings of published books to work crafted exclusively for audio. 

Numerous best-selling writers and celebrity performers are now creating for the medium. Audiobooks and other audio entertainment are available in schools and libraries and on numerous apps and online marketplaces."
47,Poetry,"Poetry is a form of literary art in which language is used for its aesthetic and evocative qualities in addition to, or in lieu of, its apparent meaning. Poetry may be written independently, as discrete poems, or may occur in conjunction with other arts, as in poetic drama, hymns or lyrics.

Poetry, and discussions of it, have a long history. Early attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy.[1] Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition and rhyme, and emphasised the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from prose.[2] From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more loosely defined as a fundamental creative act using language.[3]

Poetry often uses particular forms and conventions to expand the literal meaning of the words, or to evoke emotional or sensual responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. Poetry's use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor and simile create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.

Some forms of poetry are specific to particular cultures and genres, responding to the characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. While readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as being written in rhyming lines and regular meter, there are traditions, such as those of Du Fu and Beowulf, that use other approaches to achieve rhythm and euphony. In today's globalized world, poets often borrow styles, techniques and forms from diverse cultures and languages."
48,Paranormal Romance,"Paranormal romance is a sub-genre of the romance novel related to paranormal fiction. Paranormal romance focuses on romance and includes elements beyond the range of scientific explanation, blending together themes from the genres of urban fantasy, traditional fantasy, science fiction, or horror.

Paranormal romance may range from traditional category romances with a paranormal setting to stories where the main emphasis is on a science fiction or fantasy based plot with a romantic subplot included. Paranormal romance stories tend to feature a lot of romance, suspense and action, as well as sometimes include mystery, humor and/or horror in the plotline. 

Common hallmarks are romantic relationships between humans, vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, fairies, demons, witches, sorcerers, ghosts, and other entities of a supernatural or otherworldly nature. Beyond the more prevalent themes involving vampires, shapeshifters, or time travel, paranormal romances can also include books featuring characters with psychic abilities, like telekinesis or telepathy.

“Paranormal Romance: Romance novels in which the future, a fantasy world, or paranormal happenings are an integral part of the plot.”

49,War,"A war novel is a novel in which the primary action takes place in a field of armed combat, or in a domestic setting (or home front) where the characters are preoccupied with the preparations for, or recovery from, war. 


See history for specific wars."
50,Christian,"The term ""Christian"" is used adjectivally to describe anything associated with Christianity, or in a proverbial sense ""all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like"". It can also refer to content produced by a christian without the content being explicitly Christian."
51,Contemporary,Literature that largely takes place in the present time.
52,19th Century,"Novels or collections of stories set during the 19th century. 

The 19th century (January 1, 1801 – December 31, 1900) was the century marked by the collapse of the Spanish, First and Second French, Chinese, Holy Roman and Mughal empires. This paved the way for the growing influence of the British Empire, the Russian Empire, the United States, the German Empire, the Second French Colonial Empire and the Empire of Japan, with the British boasting unchallenged dominance after 1815."
53,Dystopia,"Dystopia is a form of literature that explores social and political structures. It is a creation of a nightmare world - unlike its opposite, Utopia, which is an ideal world. 

Dystopia is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. It often features multiple kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions, and a state of constant warfare or violence. 

Many novels combine Dystopia and Utopia, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take in its choices, ending up with one of the two possible futures. 

Dystopia is very similar to False Utopia, but instead of the often visibly oppressive and/or anarchic ""true"" Dystopia, a False Utopia appears inviting at first and may well be a nice place to live in but hides a dark and often terrible secret beneath its innocent exterior. 

For similar themes/genres, also see: 
Utopia"
54,Realistic Fiction,"Realistic Fiction seems like real life, with characters dealing with real life problems. The plot often takes place in the present time. The situations are true or could be, but the main characters are fictional."
55,Russian Literature,"Russian literature is the literature in Russian language, written primarily by authors in Russia and its former colonies. Prior to the nineteenth century, the most prominent Russian writers were Gavrila Derzhavin, Denis Fonvizin, Alexander Sumarokov, Vasily Trediakovsky, Nikolay Karamzin and Ivan Krylov.

In the early nineteenth century, Russian literature underwent an astounding golden age and produced such renounced writers as Nikolai Gogol, Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky. In the twentieth century Russian literature produced such renounced writers as Alexander Blok, Sergei Yesenin, Anna Achmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva, Osip Mandelstam, Boris Pasternak, Joseph Brodsky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Ivan Bunin, Vladimir Nabokov, Mikhail Sholokhov, Mikhail Bulgakov, Andrey Platonov, Vassily Grossman, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrey Kurkov."
56,Mystery,"The mystery genre is a genre of fiction that follows a crime (like a murder or a disappearance) from the moment it is committed to the moment it is solved. Mystery novels are often called “whodunnits” because they turn the reader into a detective trying to figure out the who, what, when, and how of a particular crime. Most mysteries feature a detective or private eye solving a case as the central character."
57,Adult,Fiction intended for adults.
58,World War II,"The global conflict that took place between 1939 and 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. World War II is also known as the Second World War. It involved the majority of the world's nations, eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.

It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries.

This category includes non-fiction books as well as historical novels that are set during World War II."
59,Urban Fantasy,"Urban fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy in which the narrative uses supernatural elements in a 19th-century to 21st-century (or equivalent) urban society. It usually takes place in the present day (or the equivalent of the ""present day"").

Works of urban fantasy may be set in an approximation of our world in which fantastic exists secretly or in a world (such as an alternative history) in which it occurs openly, or some combination of the above. Elements such as magic, paranormal beings, other worlds and so on, may exist here. Common themes include coexistence or conflict between humans and other beings, and the changes such characters and events bring to local life are the mainspring.

Many authors, publishers, and readers distinguish them from works of paranormal romance, which use similar characters and settings, but focus on the romantic relationships between characters."
60,Teen,Books for teenagers.
61,Adventure,"Adventure fiction is a genre of fiction in which an adventure, an exciting undertaking involving risk and physical danger, forms the main storyline. Adventure novels and short stories were popular subjects for American pulp magazines, which dominated American popular fiction between the Progressive Era and the 1950s. Adventure fiction often overlaps with other genres, notably war novels, crime novels, sea stories, Robinsonades, spy stories (as in the works of John Buchan, Eric Ambler and Ian Fleming), science fiction, fantasy, (Robert E. Howard and J.R.R. Tolkien both combined the secondary world story with the adventure novel)[6] and Westerns. Not all books within these genres are adventures. Adventure fiction takes the setting and premise of these other genres, but the fast-paced plot of an adventure focuses on the actions of the hero within the setting.
